Background
 Apache HTTP Server is a popular open-source web server software that provides a reliable and scalable platform for hosting websites. It is widely used due to its robustness, flexibility, and extensive feature set. However, the Apache HTTP Server is susceptible to an HTTP response splitting vulnerability, which can be exploited by injecting malicious response headers into backend applications.
Vulnerability Detail 
 The HTTP response splitting vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server allows an attacker to perform an HTTP desynchronization attack by injecting malicious response headers into backend applications. This can lead to various security issues, such as cache poisoning, session hijacking, cross-site scripting (XSS), and remote code execution. The vulnerability affects versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.58 of the Apache HTTP Server.
Workaround
There is no known workaround for this vulnerability. It is recommended to apply the official patch by upgrading to Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.59.
Conclusion

The HTTP response splitting vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server can have severe security implications, including cache poisoning, session hijacking, XSS, and remote code execution. It is crucial to upgrade to version 2.4.59 of the Apache HTTP Server to mitigate this vulnerability. For further support and assistance in vulnerability remediation, please contact DevNack.com.
