 Security Bulletin: IBM HTTP Server is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting due to the included Apache HTTP Server (CVE-2024-24795, CVE-2023-38709)














Security Bulletin



Summary
 IBM HTTP Server used by IBM WebSphere Application Server is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting due to the included Apache HTTP Server.


Vulnerability Details
  CVEID:   CVE-2024-24795  DESCRIPTION:   Apache HTTP Server is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks, caused by a flaw in multiple modules. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to inject arbitrary HTTP headers and cause the server to return a split response, once the URL is clicked. This would allow the attacker to perform further attacks, such as Web cache poisoning or cross-site scripting, and possibly obtain sensitive information.CVSS Base score: 6.5CVSS Temporal Score: See:  https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/286940 for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N) CVEID:   CVE-2023-38709  DESCRIPTION:   Apache HTTP Server is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks, caused by improper input validation in the core. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to inject arbitrary HTTP headers and cause the server to return a split response, once the URL is clicked. This would allow the attacker to perform further attacks, such as Web cache poisoning or cross-site scripting, and possibly obtain sensitive information.CVSS Base score: 6.5CVSS Temporal Score: See:  https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/286938 for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N)


Affected Products and Versions
  
This vulnerability affects the following version and release of IBM HTTP Server (powered by Apache) component in all editions of IBM WebSphere Application Server and bundling products
Affected Product(s)Version(s)IBM HTTP Server8.5IBM HTTP Server9.0


Remediation/Fixes
 IBM strongly recommends addressing the vulnerability now by applying a currently available interim fix or fix pack that contains the fix for APAR PH60619.
For IBM HTTP Server used by IBM WebSphere Application Server:
For V9.0.0.0 through 9.0.5.19:· Upgrade to minimal fix pack levels as required by the interim fix and then apply the Interim Fix that resolves PH60619 --OR--· Apply Fix Pack 9.0.5.20 or later (targeted availability 2Q2024). 
For V8.5.0.0 through 8.5.5.25:· Upgrade to minimal fix pack levels as required by the interim fix and then apply the Interim Fix that resolves PH60619 --OR--· Apply Fix Pack 8.5.5.26 or later (targeted availability 3Q2024).
 Additional interim fixes may be available and linked off the interim fix download page.
Important Note
IBM strongly suggests that all System z customers be subscribed to the System z Security Portal to receive the latest critical System z security and integrity service. If you are not subscribed, see the instructions on the System z Security web site. Security and integrity APARs and associated fixes will be posted to this portal. IBM suggests reviewing the CVSS scores and applying all security or integrity fixes as soon as possible to minimize any potential risk.

Disclaimer
According to the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an "industry open standard designed to convey vulnerability severity and help to determine urgency and priority of response." IBM PROVIDES THE CVSS SCORES ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. CUSTOMERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF ANY ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY. In addition to other efforts to address potential vulnerabilities, IBM periodically updates the record of components contained in our product offerings. As part of that effort, if IBM identifies previously unidentified packages in a product/service inventory, we address relevant vulnerabilities regardless of CVE date. Inclusion of an older CVEID does not demonstrate that the referenced product has been used by IBM since that date, nor that IBM was aware of a vulnerability as of that date. We are making clients aware of relevant vulnerabilities as we become aware of them. "Affected Products and Versions" referenced in IBM Security Bulletins are intended to be only products and versions that are supported by IBM and have not passed their end-of-support or warranty date. Thus, failure to reference unsupported or extended-support products and versions in this Security Bulletin does not constitute a determination by IBM that they are unaffected by the vulnerability. Reference to one or more unsupported versions in this Security Bulletin shall not create an obligation for IBM to provide fixes for any unsupported or extended-support products or versions.
