CVE-2019-17567         mod_proxy_wstunnel configured on an URL that is not          necessarily Upgraded by the origin server was tunneling          the whole connection regardless, thus allowing for subsequent requests          on the same connection to pass through with no HTTP validation,          authentication or authorization possibly configured.    CVE-2023-31122        An Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability was found in mod_macro.    CVE-2023-38709        A faulty input validation was found in the core of Apache         that allows malicious or exploitable backend/content generators         to split HTTP responses.    CVE-2023-45802        When an HTTP/2 stream was reset (RST frame) by a client, there was a         time window were the request's memory resources were not reclaimed         immediately. Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection close.        A client could send new requests and resets, keeping the connection         busy and open and causing the memory footprint to keep on growing.        On connection close, all resources were reclaimed, but the process         might run out of memory before that.    CVE-2024-24795        HTTP Response splitting in multiple modules in Apache HTTP Server         allows an attacker that can inject malicious response headers into         backend applications to cause an HTTP desynchronization attack.    CVE-2024-27316        HTTP/2 incoming headers exceeding the limit are temporarily         buffered in nghttp2 in order to generate an informative HTTP         413 response. If a client does not stop sending headers, this         leads to memory exhaustion.    For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version     2.4.59-1~deb10u1.    Please note that the fix of CVE-2024-24795, may break unrelated     CGI-BIN scripts. As part of the security fix, the Apache webserver     mod_cgi module has stopped relaying the Content-Length field     of the HTTP reply header from the CGI programs back to the client     in cases where the connection is to be closed and the client     is able to read until end-of-file. You may restore legacy     behavior for trusted scripts by adding the following configuration     environment variable to the     Apache configuration, scoped to the <Directory> entry or     entries in which scripts are being served via CGI,     SetEnv ap_trust_cgilike_cl yes.    The definitive fix is to read the whole input,     re-allocating the input buffer to fit as more input is received     in CGI-BIN scripts, and and to not trust that     CONTENT_LENGTH variable is always present.    We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.
