It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities:  - A race condition was addressed with improved locking. This issue is fixed in macOS Ventura 13.3. An app     may bypass Gatekeeper checks. (CVE-2023-27952)  - Faulty input validation in the core of Apache allows malicious or exploitable backend/content generators     to split HTTP responses. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server: through 2.4.58. (CVE-2023-38709)  - A segment fault (SEGV) flaw was found in libtiff that could be triggered by passing a crafted tiff file to     the TIFFReadRGBATileExt() API. This flaw allows a remote attacker to cause a heap-buffer overflow, leading     to a denial of service. (CVE-2023-52356)  - An out-of-memory flaw was found in libtiff. Passing a crafted tiff file to TIFFOpen() API may allow a     remote attacker to cause a denial of service via a craft input with size smaller than 379 KB.    (CVE-2023-6277)  - When a protocol selection parameter option disables all protocols without adding any then the default set     of protocols would remain in the allowed set due to an error in the logic for removing protocols. The     below command would perform a request to curl.se with a plaintext protocol which has been explicitly     disabled. curl --proto -all,-http http://curl.se The flaw is only present if the set of selected protocols     disables the entire set of available protocols, in itself a command with no practical use and therefore     unlikely to be encountered in real situations. The curl security team has thus assessed this to be low     severity bug. (CVE-2024-2004)  - libcurl skips the certificate verification for a QUIC connection under certain conditions, when built to     use wolfSSL. If told to use an unknown/bad cipher or curve, the error path accidentally skips the     verification and returns OK, thus ignoring any certificate problems. (CVE-2024-2379)  - When an application tells libcurl it wants to allow HTTP/2 server push, and the amount of received headers     for the push surpasses the maximum allowed limit (1000), libcurl aborts the server push. When aborting,     libcurl inadvertently does not free all the previously allocated headers and instead leaks the memory.    Further, this error condition fails silently and is therefore not easily detected by an application.    (CVE-2024-2398)  - libcurl did not check the server certificate of TLS connections done to a host specified as an IP address,     when built to use mbedTLS. libcurl would wrongly avoid using the set hostname function when the specified     hostname was given as an IP address, therefore completely skipping the certificate check. This affects all     uses of TLS protocols (HTTPS, FTPS, IMAPS, POPS3, SMTPS, etc). (CVE-2024-2466)  - HTTP Response splitting in multiple modules in Apache HTTP Server allows an attacker that can inject     malicious response headers into backend applications to cause an HTTP desynchronization attack. Users are     recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.59, which fixes this issue. (CVE-2024-24795)  - HTTP/2 incoming headers exceeding the limit are temporarily buffered in nghttp2 in order to generate an     informative HTTP 413 response. If a client does not stop sending headers, this leads to memory exhaustion.    (CVE-2024-27316)  - A logic issue was addressed with improved state management. This issue is fixed in macOS Sonoma 14.6.    Enabling Lockdown Mode while setting up a Mac may cause FileVault to become unexpectedly disabled.    (CVE-2024-27862)  - An information disclosure issue was addressed with improved private data redaction for log entries. This     issue is fixed in iOS 17.6 and iPadOS 17.6, watchOS 10.6, tvOS 17.6, visionOS 1.3, macOS Sonoma 14.6. A     local attacker may be able to determine kernel memory layout.

An app may be able to access protected user data. (CVE-2024-27871)  - This issue was addressed with improved validation of symlinks. This issue is fixed in macOS Sonoma 14.6.    An app may be able to access protected user data. (CVE-2024-27872)  - An out-of-bounds write issue was addressed with improved input validation.
