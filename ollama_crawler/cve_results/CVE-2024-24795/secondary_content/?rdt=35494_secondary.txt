Best Vulnerability feed ?




    Hello,
  

    I'm looking to replace my old NVD vuln feed. I sav other competitors (vuldb.com, cybersecurity-help.cz...) but I'm eager to know what are your tech choices :)
  
    My benchmark:
  


    API-friendly (REST is great, only few queries per day)
  


    Getting interesting insights :
  


    CVSS reviews(we all know NVD's quality on the topic),
  


    technical insights (causing the vuln, exploit in the wild...),
  


    recommendations & patching (Source & destination versions)
  


    And even more ! EPSS, Detection advices (Sigma/yaras...)...
  




    Thank you gents,
