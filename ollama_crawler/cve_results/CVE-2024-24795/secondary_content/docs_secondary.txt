Charmed Ceph Documentation

Charmed Ceph is a software-defined storage solution that provides object, block and file storage on commodity hardware.
Charmed Ceph makes it easy to use and deploy Ceph. It provides a simpler way to deliver Ceph to users using a set of scripts called charms that are deployed with Juju.
Corporate users can benefit from the robust and manageable full-suite storage solution, and the ease with which their Ceph clusters can be deployed with Charmed Ceph.
An individual or corporate user with a large and growing volume of valuable data to manage, and appreciates the ease of integration with other cloud services would greatly benefit from Charmed Ceph.
