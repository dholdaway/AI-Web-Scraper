Data Sources
		
					This documentation assumes that you already understand at least one common programming 
					language and are generally familiar with JSON RESTful services.  JSON specifies the 
					format of the data returned by the REST service. REST refers to a style of services 
					that allow computers to communicate via HTTP over the Internet.  
					Click here for a list of 
					best practices and additional information 
					on where to start. The NVD is also documenting  
					popular workflows to assist developers 
					working with the APIs. 
				


Source API

					The Source API is used to easily retrieve detailed information on the organizations 
					that provide the data contained in the NVD dataset.  										 
				

					The API is updated whenever a new source is added, or an existing source is 
					modified.  Data sources change so infrequently that users interested in this information
					may choose to limit their requests to once per day.   
				



Base URL

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/source/2.0




				Parameters
			





lastModStartDate & lastModEndDate optional

{start date}
{end date}

	
							These parameters return only the source records that were last 			
							modified during the specified period. If a source record has been modified 
							more recently than the specified period, it will not be included 
							in the response.  If filtering by the last modified date, both 
							lastModStartDate and lastModEndDate are 
							required.   
							The maximum allowable range when using any 
							date range parameters is 120 consecutive days. 
						

							A source record is considered "modified" 					
							when any of the follow actions occur: 
						

A new source record is created 
An existing source record is modified
An existing source changes acceptance level in CVMAP


							Values must be entered in the extended ISO-8601 date/time format:							
						
[YYYY][“-”][MM][“-”][DD][“T”][HH][“:”][MM][“:”][SS][Z]

							The "T" is a literal to separate the date from the time. The Z indicates 
							an optional offset-from-UTC. Please note, if a positive Z value is used 
							(such as +01:00 for Central European Time) then the "+" should be encoded 
							in the request as "%2B". The user agent may handle this automatically. 
						


Request all source records modified between the start and end datetimes

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/source/2.0/?lastModStartDate=2021-08-04T13:00:00.000%2B01:00&lastModEndDate=2021-10-22T13:36:00.000%2B01:00





resultsPerPage optional

{page limit}

	
							This parameter specifies the maximum number of source records to be returned 
							in a single API response. For network considerations, the default value and  
							maximum allowable limit is 1,000. 
						




sourceIdentifier optional

{sourceIdentifier}

	
							This parameter returns all source records where the exact value of sourceIdentifiers 
							matches the {sourceIdentifier}.
						

							A request made to the Source API without any additional parameters will return detailed information on 
							all organizations that provide the data contained in the NVD dataset, including every valid 
							{sourceIdentifier} value. The CVE API also 
							returns valid {sourceIdentifier} values within the descriptions object.
						


Request all source records associated with the data source "cve@mitre.org"

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/source/2.0?sourceIdentifier=cve@mitre.org





startIndex optional

{offset}

	
							This parameter specifies the index of the first source record to be returned in 
							the response data. The index is zero-based, meaning the first source record 
							is at index zero.  
						

							The Source API returns four primary objects in the response body that are 
							used for pagination:
							resultsPerPage, startIndex, totalResults, 
							and sources.  totalResults indicates the 
							total number of source records that match the request parameters.  
							If the value of totalResults is greater than the value of resultsPerPage, 
							there are more records than could be returned by a single API 
							response and additional requests must update the startIndex 
							to get the remaining records.
						

							The best, most efficient, practice for keeping up to date with 
							the NVD is to use the date range parameters to request 
							only the source records that have been modified since your last request. 
						


Request 20 source records, beginning at index 0 and ending at index 19

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/source/2.0/?resultsPerPage=20&startIndex=0




Request the source records, beginning at index 20 and ending at index 39

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/source/2.0/?resultsPerPage=20&startIndex=20








				Response
			


Data Sources API JSON Schema

				This API response includes only one JSON schema for defining the structure of the response data.
				The following document includes information 
				on data types, regex patterns, maximum character length, and similar information that can support 
				developers and database administrators looking to create their own local repository.
			

Source Schema

Response Details

				The Source API returns seven primary objects in the body of the response: 
				resultsPerPage, startIndex, 
				totalResults, format, 
				version, timestamp, 
				and sources.           
			

				The totalResults object indicates the number of source records
				that match the request criteria, including all parameters. If the value of 
				totalResults is greater than the value of 
				resultsPerPage, then additional requests are necessary to 
				return the remaining records. The parameter startIndex may be 
				used in subsequent requests to identify the starting point for the next request. More 
				information and the best practices for using  resultsPerPage  
				and startIndex are described above.
			

				The format and version objects 
				identify the format and version of the API response. timestamp  
				identifies when the response was generated.
			

				The sources object contains an array of objects equal
				to the number of records returned in the response and is sorted in ascending order 
				by the created property.
				The sources object is explained in more detail below.     
			

				JSON response objects are either optional or required.  Required response objects are always returned 
				by the API and may contain fields without data.  Optional response objects are only returned when 
				they contain data.  For example, the v3AcceptanceLevel object is optional 
				so it will only appear when a data source is a participant in the 
				Collaborative Vulnerability Metadata Acceptance Process (CVMAP) and 
				it has an CVSSv3 acceptance level.    
			
sources  required 

				This object contains the following required data: source name, 
				the email address used by the CVE Program to identify the source, 
				an object containing all email addresses linked to the source,
				the date and time that the source first appeared in the NVD, and 
				the date and time that the record was last modified.
			

				If the source participates in CVMAP the following optional objects may be returned: 
				v2AcceptanceLevel, 
				v3AcceptanceLevel, and
				cweAcceptanceLevel. 
				Each object contains the source's current level in the process and the date 
				that the level last changed.  Complete audit histories are available on the 
				CVMAP webpage.
