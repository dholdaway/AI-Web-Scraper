Reporting New Security Problems with the Apache HTTP Server¶
The Apache Software Foundation takes a very active stance in eliminating
security problems and denial of service attacks against the Apache HTTP
server.
We strongly encourage folks to report such problems to the private security
mailing list of the ASF Security Team, before disclosing them in a public
forum.
Please see the page of the ASF Security
Team for further information and contact
information.
The Security Team cannot accept regular bug reports or other queries, we
ask that you use our bug reporting page for
those.
All mail sent to the Security Team that does
not relate to security problems in Apache software will be
ignored.
Note that all networked servers are subject to denial of service attacks,
and we cannot promise magic workarounds to generic problems (such as a
client streaming lots of data to your server, or re-requesting the same URL
repeatedly). In general our philosophy is to avoid any attacks which can
cause the server to consume resources in a non-linear relationship to the
size of inputs.

Security Standards¶
Apache HTTP Server vulnerabilities are labelled with
CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
identifiers.
Historical Releases¶
Earlier versions of Apache HTTP Server are no longer receiving security
updates and should not be used.
