Background
 Apache HTTP Server is a widely used open-source web server software. It provides a robust and scalable platform for hosting websites and applications. The mod_rewrite module in Apache allows for URL rewriting and redirection. However, in certain configurations, a vulnerability exists that enables Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. This vulnerability specifically affects Apache HTTP Server running on Windows with mod_rewrite in the server/vhost context.
Vulnerability Detail 
 The SSRF vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server on Windows with mod_rewrite in the server/vhost context allows an attacker to potentially leak NTLM hashes to a malicious server via SSRF and malicious requests. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, compromise user accounts, or perform other malicious activities. It is important to note that this vulnerability is specific to the Windows platform and requires the presence of mod_rewrite in the server/vhost context.
Workaround
There is no specific workaround mentioned for this vulnerability. It is crucial to apply the recommended fix by upgrading to the patched version of Apache HTTP Server.
Conclusion

The SSRF vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server on Windows with mod_rewrite in the server/vhost context poses a significant security risk. It allows attackers to potentially leak NTLM hashes and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.62 or later to mitigate this vulnerability. For a thorough exploration and assistance in countering such issues, consult the Vulert Vulnerability Database.
