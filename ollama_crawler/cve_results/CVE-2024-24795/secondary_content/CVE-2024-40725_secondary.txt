Background
 Apache HTTP Server is a widely used open-source web server software that provides a reliable and secure platform for hosting websites. It offers various features and modules to handle HTTP requests and serve web content. However, a vulnerability has been discovered in version 2.4.61 of Apache HTTP Server that affects the handling of legacy content-type based configuration of handlers. This vulnerability, identified as CVE-2024-40725, can lead to source code disclosure of local content when certain files are requested indirectly. For example, PHP scripts may be served instead of being interpreted, potentially exposing sensitive information.
Vulnerability Detail 
 The vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.61 arises from a partial fix for CVE-2024-39884. It occurs when the 'AddType' and similar configuration directives are used in certain circumstances where files are requested indirectly. This can result in the disclosure of source code for local content. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to access sensitive information or gain unauthorized access to the server. Users of Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.61 are advised to upgrade to version 2.4.62, which includes a fix for this issue.
Conclusion

The vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.61, identified as CVE-2024-40725, can result in source code disclosure of local content when certain files are requested indirectly. This can lead to unauthorized access, data leakage, and potential exploitation of sensitive information. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to version 2.4.62 of Apache HTTP Server, which includes the necessary fix to prevent source code disclosure. Regular security practices, such as applying patches and updates, should also be followed to ensure a robust and secure web server environment. For a thorough exploration and assistance in countering such issues, consult the Vulert Vulnerability Database.
