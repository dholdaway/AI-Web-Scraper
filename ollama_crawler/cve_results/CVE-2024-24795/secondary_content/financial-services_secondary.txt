Drive business agility
A better multi-cloud strategy

          Financial institutions need hybrid multi-cloud strategy - two public clouds and an efficient private cloud to increase business agility, manage risk, reduce total cost of ownership and keep up with the pace of digital transformation. Ubuntu is optimised on AWS, Azure, Google, IBM and Oracle cloud providing seamless portability. For on-premise Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), the 451 Research Cloud Price Index shows Canonical delivers the best value.

Reduce IT operations cost
Model driven operators

          Canonical leads multi-cloud application management with the universal operator pattern to speed up operations and drive down the cost of integration.
        

          The legacy application estate is an enormous cost burden for financial institutions. In addition, the need to containerize and move to the cloud creates a new wave of complexity for IT. Choose Canonical  to address both, and transform the quality, cost and speed of software operations.
        













Finserv open source infrastructure powers hybrid cloud strategy





          Financial institutions are embracing digital transformation initiatives at pace and scale. To stay relevant and create a technology foundation that enables them to quickly bounce back from future contingencies, financial institutions will need to leverage the right mix of cloud services – a hybrid cloud strategy with a cost effective open source private cloud infrastructure at the core to maximise application performance while on-boarding innovative new capabilities.
        

          Watch the webinar for an overview of Charmed OpenStack - an enterprise grade OpenStack distribution from Canonical that leverages MAAS, Juju, and the OpenStack charmed operators to simplify the deployment and management of an OpenStack cloud.
        
















Case study
