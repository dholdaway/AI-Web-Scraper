National Vulnerability Database



NIST maintains the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), a repository of information on software and hardware flaws that can compromise computer security. This is a key piece of the nation’s cybersecurity infrastructure.











Stay ConnectedGet Our Email Updates NVD General Updates list:   Subscribe hereNVD Technical Updates  list:  Subscribe hereSocial + Email UsCheck our X feeds: @NISTcyber & @NISTEmail us: nvd [at] NIST.gov (nvd[at]NIST[dot]gov) Status UpdatesCurrent Website Status: Operational Current API Status:Operational10/22/2024:  The 2.0 api services were unavailable Beginning around 2 AM EST. We have resolved the underlying cause and services are Returning to normal.


Past news updates:August 12, 2024: Throughout the week of August 12 -16, 2024, NVD’s servers will be undergoing maintenance by NIST. There is a possibility that there will be sporadic interruptions in NVD service, lasting until 6:00 PM on August 16, 2024. July 18, 2024: We are currently updating our servers, so users may experience temporary delays or usability issues beginning around 11:00 AM on Thursday, July 18, 2024. We expect our systems to be back to normal by 3:00 PM ET on the same day. July 2, 2024: NIST has made recent updates to improve functionality of the NVD. We are aware of availability issues with the NVD API Endpoints and are working to resolve them. If you are experiencing schema validation errors, please ensure that you or the tools you use have the latest schema files, which were recently updated. Stability should return once users make these updates and implement best practices to reduce unnecessary request volume.NVD CVSS v4.0 Official SupportThe Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) provides a way to capture the principal characteristics of a vulnerability and produce a numerical score reflecting its severity. CVSS version 4.0 is the next generation of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System standard; released November 1, 2023. CVSS v4.0 provides increased granularity for Base metrics, a new Supplemental metric group, a different methodology for determining severity and more. For more information regarding CVSS v4.0 please visit https://www.first.org/cvss/v4.0/specification-document.CVSS v4.0 information will be displayed throughout the NVD website: Vulnerability Detail PagesThe Metrics section of the Vulnerability detail pages will now contain CVSS v4.0 data when available. CVSS v4.0 data will be displayed in a similar fashion to CVSS v3.x and CVSS v2.0 and will be displayed if available through NVD enrichment or CVE Program related CNA and/or ADP contributions. CVSS v4.0 CalculatorA CVSS v4.0 Calculator (based on the one provided by the FIRST CVSS SIG) has been included on the website. While visually distinct from previous calculators, the same functionality exists when including CVE IDs or CVSS vector string parameters in the URL to the page (See Calculator Product Integration). Vulnerability Search FormThe advanced section of the vulnerability search page has been updated to allow searching by CVSS v4.0 criteria. Vulnerability Search ResultsThe search results will now include CVSS v4.0 badges when appropriate. For questions and concerns, please contact nvd [at] nist.gov (nvd[at]nist[dot]gov).CISA Authorized Data Publisher (ADP) SupportAs of July 3, 2024, the NVD will support inclusion of data from CISA’s Vulnrichment CVSS and CWE information. The Vulnrichment data will now be displayed on the vulnerability detail pages and attributed to the CISA-ADP (Authorized Data Publisher) source along with any relevant CVSS data contributed by NVD enrichment efforts or CNAs.This information can also be accessed using the NVD 2.0 APIs! The CVSS information can be located within the metrics object and the CWE information can be found within weaknesses array.  No schema changes were necessary to support this update.Note:  The legacy data feed files will not contain the Vulnrichment information. For questions and concerns, please contact nvd [at] nist.gov (nvd[at]nist[dot]gov). May 29, 2024: NIST has awarded a contract for additional processing support for incoming Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) for inclusion in the National Vulnerability Database. We are confident that this additional support will allow us to return to the processing rates we maintained prior to February 2024 within the next few months.In addition, a backlog of unprocessed CVEs has developed since February. NIST is working with the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to facilitate the addition of these unprocessed CVEs to the NVD. We anticipate that that this backlog will be cleared by the end of the fiscal year. As we shared earlier, NIST is also working on ways to address the increasing volume of vulnerabilities through technology and process updates. Our goal is to build a program that is sustainable for the long term and to support the automation of vulnerability management, security measurement and compliance.With a 25-year history of providing this database of vulnerabilities to users around the world and given that we do not play an enforcement or oversight role, NIST is uniquely suited to manage the NVD. NIST is fully committed to maintaining and modernizing this important national resource that is vital to building and maintaining trust in information technology and fostering innovation. Moving forward, we will keep the community informed of our progress toward normal operational levels and our future modernization plans.May 20, 2024: On May 8, 2024, the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program deployed support for the CVE 5.1 record format. Once the deployment started, NIST was not able to process records with the new format until we released a subsequent deployment for NVD-related systems on May 14, 2024. We are now ingesting both CVE 5.0 and CVE 5.1 records into the NVD dataset on an hourly basis and we’re working as fast as we can to return to normal processing.  April 25, 2024: NIST maintains the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), a repository of information on software and hardware flaws that can compromise computer security. This is a key piece of the nation’s cybersecurity infrastructure.There is a growing backlog of vulnerabilities submitted to the NVD and requiring analysis. This is based on a variety of factors, including an increase in software and, therefore, vulnerabilities, as well as a change in interagency support. Currently, we are prioritizing analysis of the most significant vulnerabilities. In addition, we are working with our agency partners to bring on more support for analyzing vulnerabilities and have reassigned additional NIST staff to this task as well.We are also looking into longer-term solutions to this challenge, including the establishment of a consortium of industry, government, and other stakeholder organizations that can collaborate on research to improve the NVD.NIST is committed to its continued support and management of the NVD. Currently, we are focused on our immediate plans to address the CVE backlog, but plan to keep the community posted on potential plans for the consortium as they develop. For questions and concerns, you can contact nvd [at] nist.gov (nvd[at]nist[dot]gov).More historical updates
