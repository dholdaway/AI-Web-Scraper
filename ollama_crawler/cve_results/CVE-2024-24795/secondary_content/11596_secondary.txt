Linux Dangling PFN Mapping / Use-After-Free
Posted Oct 22, 2024
Authored by Jann Horn, Google Security Research, Seth Jenkins
An error path in usbdev_mmap() (where remap_pfn_range() fails midway through) frees pages before the PFN mapping pointing to those pages is cleaned up, making physical page use-after-free possible. Some other drivers look like they might have similar issues.

msm 5.15 Arbitrary Kernel Address Access
Posted Oct 15, 2024
Authored by Google Security Research, Seth Jenkins
This bug was found in msm-5.15 using tag KERNEL.PLATFORM.2.1.r1-05400-kernel.0. The fastrpc_file struct contains a flag, is_compat, that is set if the 32-bit compat_ioctl vfs handler is ever called on a fastrpc file (e.g. by opening and ioctling on /dev/adsprpc-smd). This flag is later used inside of e.g. fastrpc_internal_invoke2's macro invocations of K_COPY_FROM_USER to make decisions about whether the provided pointer is a userland pointer or a kernel-land pointer. However, because the state for making this K_COPY_FROM_USER decision is stored within the broadly accessible fastrpc_file struct instead of stored per ioctl invocation, this means that 64-bit ioctl invocations of fastrpc_internal_invoke2 will use userland provided addresses as kernel pointers if the 32-bit ioctl interface of the same fastrpc_file was ever previously invoked. This leads directly to attacker-controlled reads of arbitrary kernel addresses.

Android qrtr_bpf_filter_detach Double-Free / Use-After-Free
Posted Oct  4, 2024
Authored by Google Security Research
There appears to be some (possibly deprecated) code associated with AF_QIPCRTR sockets in bpf_service.c. Within this file are some ioctl handlers - e.g. qrtr_bpf_filter_attach and qrtr_bpf_filter_detach. In the case of qrtr_bpf_filter_detach, the global pointer bpf_filter is fetched and freed while only holding a socket lock (and an irrelevant rcu_read_lock) - this may lead directly to double frees or use-after-free (kernel memory corruption) if a malicious user is able to call the QRTR_DETTACH_BPF ioctl on multiple AF_QIPCRTR sockets at once. Based on Android SELinux files, it appears this may be possible from some lower-privileged vendor and HAL services.

PowerVR DEVMEMXINT_RESERVATION::ppsPMR Use-After-Free
Posted Sep 10, 2024
Authored by Jann Horn, Google Security Research
The array ppsPMR in DEVMEMXINT_RESERVATION holds references to PMR structures (using PMRRefPMR2()), intending to prevent the PMRs' physical memory from being released. However, PMRs with PVRSRV_MEMALLOCFLAG_NO_OSPAGES_ON_ALLOC (which for OSMem PMRs internally translates to FLAG_ONDEMAND) can release their backing physical pages while references to the PMR still exist; PMRLockSysPhysAddresses() must be used to prevent a PMR's backing pages from disappearing, like in DevmemIntMapPMR2(). Therefore, it is currently possible to free a PMR's backing pages while the PMR is mapped into a DEVMEMXINT_RESERVATION, leading to physical page use-after-free.
