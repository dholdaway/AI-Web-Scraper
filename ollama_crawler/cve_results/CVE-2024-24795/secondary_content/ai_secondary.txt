Move beyond experimentation with machine learning operations (MLOps)




          MLOps is the short term for machine learning operations and it stands for a set of practices that aim to simplify workflow processes and automate machine learning and deep learning deployments.
        

          MLOps is an approach that enables you to deploy and maintain models reliably and efficiently for production, at a large scale.
