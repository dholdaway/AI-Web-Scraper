Grafana Remote Code Execution
Posted Oct 24, 2024
Authored by z3k0sec | Site github.com
This repository contains a Python script that exploits a remote code execution vulnerability in Grafana's SQL Expressions feature. By leveraging insufficient input sanitization, this exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the server. This is made possible through the shellfs community extension, which can be installed and loaded by an attacker to facilitate command execution.
