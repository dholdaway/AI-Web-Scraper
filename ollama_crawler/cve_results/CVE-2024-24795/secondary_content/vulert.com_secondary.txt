Why Choose Vulert?










No Installation Required




                                You do not need to share your codebase or perform any
                                complex integrations. All that is required is to upload
                                the manifest file, such as a package-lock file, of your application.
                                











Proactive Security



                                Existing solutions assess the current security of your software.
                                In contrast, we not only monitor your application for current issues,
                                but also proactively detect potential
                                Future Security Issues
                                and alert you.

                            









Easy Vulnerability Management



                                Once you have addressed the vulnerabilities, you can upload the updated manifest through
                                the API or dashboard, and we will automatically update your vulnerability status.
                            









Zero False-Positives
                            



                                Vulert is the only tool in the industry with zero false positives, sending alerts only
                                for the dependencies and specific versions you use, resulting in zero false positive
                                alerts.

Vulert's Leading Features: Security at Its Finest










SIEM Integration


Elevate your security analytics by integrating Vulert with leading SIEM tools like
                                Splunk,
                                LogRhythm, and ArcSight to get real-time notifications.









CI/CD Integration

                                Reduce attack risks by addressing vulnerabilities early.









SBOM Monitoring


Vulert monitors vendor-provided SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials), identifies vulnerable
                                applications, and assesses risks from compromised packages.
                            









Transparent Pricing


Vulert's transparent pricing makes it easier for you to understand what you'll pay.
                            









Unlimited Scans


Vulert scans your apps 24/7, yet you can still scan whenever you want without any
                                limitations.
                            









Vulnerability Rankings


On the Vulert Enriched Dashboard, you can filter vulnerabilities by severity, impact, and
                                disclosure date.
                            









Rich Dashboards


Track vulnerabilities and compliance issues from a central location.









Suggested Fixes


For each vulnerability, Vulert suggests easy fixes and, whenever possible, also suggests
                                workarounds.
                            









Jira Integration


Vulert automatically generates Jira issues upon detecting new vulnerabilities in your
                                application.

                        The Team Dashboard helps managers, team leads, security analysts or business owners monitor
                        their organization's security. It simplifies viewing current vulnerabilities impacting your
                        organization, the number of vulnerable dependencies, and more.

                        The Application Dashboard enables developers to oversee their application's security,
                        streamlining the process of identifying current vulnerabilities, tracking vulnerable
                        dependencies, and more. Additionally, it facilitates updating application settings, such as
                        integrating with Jira.

Frequently asked questions










                                    What sets Vulert apart from other alternatives such as Snyk and Whitesource scan?
                                





                                Setting up an account with other providers can be a complex and time-consuming process.
                                In many cases, you are required to either install their software or provide them with
                                access to your codebase. Vulert, on the other hand, eliminates the need for integration
                                or installation, and proactively sends real-time alerts without any additional effort from you.

                                It's Risky

                                It's essential to consider the potential consequences if the service
                                provider you choose were to suffer a data breach. The purpose of these
                                services is to protect you from supply chain attacks, but if the provider
                                is compromised, it could put your own security at risk.
                                With Vulert, you can rest easy knowing that your data is protected
                                without incurring additional risk.


                                Privacy

                                Vulert requires only a list of open-source packages via a manifest file,
                                such as package-lock.json. Our service prioritizes your privacy, so only
                                you will have knowledge of which of your applications are at risk due to
                                open-source vulnerabilities.


                            






                                    How Does it work ?
                                




                                Vulert proactively monitors security advisories for the open-source software
                                used within your application from multiple sources,
                                including npm, Maven, Go, NuGet, PyPI, RubyGems, crates.io, Packagist, Linux,
                                and OSS-Fuzz. As soon as a security issue is discovered and a vendor has
                                issued a security advisory, you will be promptly notified,
                                allowing you to take action to protect your application.

                                    Why the name vulert?
                                




                                Vulert is derived from the combination of two words: "Vulnerability" and "Alert."
                                The name reflects our mission to proactively alert you to potential vulnerabilities
                                in your software.
