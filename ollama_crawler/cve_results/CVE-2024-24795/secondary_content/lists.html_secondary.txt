Apache HTTP Server Mailing Lists¶
The following mailing lists relate to the Apache HTTP Server project. Users
should consider subscribing to the Announcements or User
Support mailing lists. Other lists are for people interested
in helping with the development and debugging of the server.
Formatted archives are available in several places including the Apache
Mail Archives ,
MarkMail , and
MARC. Raw mbox archives for most lists are
available at
http://httpd.apache.org/mail/. You can
also use the mail-to-news gateway offered by
GMANE to access
most of the lists with a news reader.

Apache HTTP Server Development Main Discussion List

Apache Server Announcements¶
The announce@httpd.apache.org mailing list is used to announce major
releases and other important information about the Apache HTTP Server
project. Messages are posted only by the Foundation; there is no
discussion.

User Support and Discussion¶
The lists and discussion groups listed here are the only place that
configuration and how-to questions belong, ever. Every day, users become
frustrated, not with Apache, but with how nobody will help them understand
how to get started. 95% of the time, it's not for lack of helpers, but for
lack of effort and well stated questions.
Before you go further, please read Eric S. Raymond and Rick Moen's
explanation of "How To Ask Questions The Smart
Way". If you follow
their advice, you will discover that these forums have dozens of helpers
ready to provide you with guidance on using the Apache HTTP Server! Note:
Do not send your Apache questions to Eric or Rick!
There are now a few Apache HTTP Server Users Mailing Lists available in
different languages.
They are described on separate pages:


English list


German list


In addition, there are a few usenet discussion groups in which discussions
about the server can be found. These include:


comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix [
nntp ] [
google
]


comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows [

comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi [

Apache HTTP Server Development Main Discussion List¶
The dev@httpd.apache.org mailing list is used for discussions about the
actual development of the server. All httpd candidates for release are
announced to this list prior to acceptance. Subscribers to this list are
encouraged to 'test-drive' these candidates just before they're generally
released, and provide their feedback in a [vote] thread. Note these
candidates are NOT yet released, and should not be carried on
announcement channels, until the testing is complete and they have been
voted as released on the dev@ list.
Configuration and support questions should be addressed to a user support
group. This list is only for discussion of changes to the
source code and related issues. Other questions are likely to be ignored.

or modified.
If you take ownership of bug by assigning it to yourself, please remember
to add this mailing list to the cc: list so that the list continues to

Source Change Reports¶

applied, Subversion log messages are sent to all subscribers. (The list
name is an artifact of the fact that we used to use CVS.)

Third-Party Module Authors' List¶
This mailing list is for people who are actually involved in writing
third-party or private modules for the Apache HTTP server. It is a peer
support list for programmers to discuss issues surrounding the development
of web server modules using the Apache HTTP Server module and APR APIs. It
was historically hosted at apache-modules@covalent.net, now closed, but
still archived on MARC (see Archives, below).

Proxy Module Rework Discussion List¶
This list is closed. Proxy development discussion should take place on the

development questions to the Main Development Discussion List.
