Advancing on managed OpenStack


















































Why managed private cloud?



While public clouds provide immediate access to the infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) offering, they are not economical in the long term and at scale. At the same time, implementing a private cloud comes with a cost.

        What if:
        
Your public cloud costs are growing with a trajectory you cannot afford?
You have no knowledge and experience to deploy and operate a cost-effective private cloud yourself?
You do not have enough resources to provide 24x7 coverage for the platform hosting your business apps?
You need a quick time-to-market and have no time to hire and train a dedicated operations team?
You have no facilities to host a private cloud?

Canonical's Managed OpenStack solves all those challenges, providing the fastest and the most cost-effective path to an OpenStack private cloud.

Analysts rate Managed OpenStack high
The decision whether to run applications in the public or private cloud should always be driven by economics. In the 451 Research analysis of cloud economics from 2017, Canonical's Managed OpenStack stands out for cost efficiency against VMware and other OpenStack distributions.




        Key findings:
        
Private clouds should be run at very high density
Capacity planning is simplified with hybrid/multi-cloud
Hyper-converged architecture results in significant savings
Full automation of deployment and operations brings costs down
High availability architecture underpin production-grade SLAs
Lift-and-shift migration helps to move from VMware or other platforms

What is Managed OpenStack?
Managed OpenStack is a fully-managed service for Charmed OpenStack provided by Canonical. We build the cloud and we manage it for you. From 24x7 monitoring, through daily maintenance tasks to regular upgrades. We focus on your cloud, you focus on your business.



Maximum multi-cloud cost optimisation

When your public cloud costs grow substantially, simply move the majority of your workloads to a private cloud. Managed OpenStack is a cost-effective extension to the public cloud infrastructure, providing the same level of service.





More economical up to 300 hosts

Since you do not have to hire and train a dedicated operations team, Managed OpenStack is a more economical option in private cloud environments up to 300 nodes.





Transparent, predictable pricing

$15 per host per day with no additional hidden costs. A fully transparent pricing model enables predictable budgeting. Everything is clear from day 0.





Offload your internal team

The benefit of public clouds is the ability to focus exclusively on business apps and not the underlying infrastructure. Your private cloud should allow the same. With Managed OpenStack we focus on your cloud, while you focus on your business.





Accelerate your time-to-market

Implementing private cloud infrastructure usually takes months. Managed OpenStack reduces this time to weeks. Simply move to market faster and let us take care of the rest.





On your premises or in a partner data centre

With Managed OpenStack you get the flexibility of where the cloud gets deployed. If you do not have facilities to host the cloud, we can deploy it in one of our partners' data centres.





No lock-in

Your team can monitor every machine in the cloud at any given time, and be trained to operate the cloud themselves. On request we transfer control of your cloud back to your organisation.





Scale on-demand

We scale your cloud on demand. Just let us know that there are additional servers in the data centre. We will test the hardware remotely and expand your cloud - all with zero down time.





Upgrades included

As OpenStack evolves, your private cloud can be upgraded to the latest version to benefit from new features and software updates. We provide fully automated OpenStack upgrades with minimal down time.

Canonical's Managed OpenStack gave us instant access and all the benefits of a cloud platform with fixed, predictable and manageable cost comparable to public cloud. We have the assurance of a reliable, run by experts cloud platform and can grow and adapt it as we need.
Daniel Rylin, Head of IT Infrastructure and Cloud Solutions, Tele2





Performance, reliability, security
Private clouds have to be competitive with public cloud infrastructure, and they need to be fast, reliable and secure. Our experience with OpenStack at scale ensures that we deliver efficient, resilient and hardened private clouds – with production-grade service level agreements (SLAs).



Aggressive SLAs

We guarantee 99.9% availability of the cloud. Our expertise, based on data from hundreds of clouds, underpins your SLA. Our operations are certified, with regular independent audits.





Carrier-grade private cloud

Managed OpenStack is your fastest path to a modern telco cloud. We provide all necessary performance extensions to run mission-critical network services as required in 5G network use cases.





Full-stack support

As the publisher of Ubuntu, we uniquely support the full stack. Complex issues in cloud infrastructure require analysis and fixes all the way down to the kernel. With us, there are no loose ends.





10 years of security

Not every organisation is willing to upgrade their cloud on a regular basis. With Managed OpenStack you stay secure for up to 10 years under Canonical's Expanded Security Maintenance (ESM) programme with no need to upgrade.





Hardening programmes

Cloud hardening ensures the highest level of security in the telecom and financial sectors. Managed OpenStack provides cloud hardening programmes according to common benchmarks such as CIS.





Local regulatory compliance

Included in the service pricing are local regulatory compliance programmes. Managed OpenStack is GDPR, CSEC and HIPAA compliant.





Interoperability

Hardware specifications, software-defined networking (SDN) controllers, storage platforms. We provide you with the flexibility to integrate your desired functionality. We help you choose what fits your requirements to provide the best value for money.





Data protection

A common challenge in the cloud is the data protection of your applications. Add TrilioVault backup and recovery for both data and metadata to improve resiliency and meet SLAs.





Observability stack

Our team actively monitors the cloud 24x7, providing observability, alerting, capacity planning and continuous service checks to ensure your cloud is healthy and stays that way.

Straightforward path to managed private cloud
Get Managed OpenStack in a few weeks with these five simple steps.





              Design
            

              Together, we design the cloud according to your needs.
              
              We guide you through the hardware specification process to maximise price-performance, and tailor cloud
              architecture to meet your capacity, workload, security, regulatory and integration requirements.
            














              Model
            
Once the design step is completed, we translate all design decisions into a
              model that is reusable across various environments. Modeling guarantees repeatable deployments and enables
              integration with infrastructure-as-code (IaC) and continuous integration continuous delivery (CICD) systems.
            














              Deploy
            
We deploy the cloud for you on your premises or in one of our partners' data
              centres. We validate it post-deployment and benchmark its performance. At the end, we provide you with the
              deployment guide which outlines all the steps required to re-deploy the cloud if needed.














              Operate
            
After day-1, day-2 comes in. The cloud is managed 24x7 by our team of cloud
              experts. We provide cloud monitoring, incident and problem resolution and take care of daily maintenance
              tasks, including regular OpenStack upgrades. We also provide 24x7 commercial support, including security
              updates, bug fixes, etc.














              Transfer
            
On request, we transfer control over your cloud back to your organisation. We
              train your personnel, make sure you are able to operate the cloud yourself moving forward and perform a formal
              handover process. We continue providing commercial support to make sure your cloud receives security updates
              and you receive help if needed.
