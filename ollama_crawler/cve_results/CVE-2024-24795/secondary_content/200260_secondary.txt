It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the TNS-2024-10 advisory.  - Security Center leverages third-party software to help provide underlying functionality. Several of the     third-party components (Apache, PHP) were found to contain vulnerabilities, and updated versions have been     made available by the providers.Out of caution and in line with best practice, Tenable has opted to     upgrade these components to address the potential impact of the issues. Security Center 6.4.0 updates     Apache to version 2.4.59 and PHP to version 8.2.13 to address the identified vulnerabilities.Additionally,     two separate vulnerabilities were discovered, reported and fixed:A stored cross site scripting     vulnerability exists in Tenable Security Center where an authenticated, remote attacker could inject HTML     code into a web application scan result page. - CVE-2024-1891An improper privilege management     vulnerability exists in Tenable Security Center where an authenticated, remote attacker could view     unauthorized objects and launch scans without having the required privileges. - CVE-2024-5759 Tenable has     released Security Center 6.4.0 to address these issues.
