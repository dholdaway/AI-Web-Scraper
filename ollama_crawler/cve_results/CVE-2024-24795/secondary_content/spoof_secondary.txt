NTP Mode 7 GET_RESTRICT DRDoS Scanner
Posted Sep  1, 2024
Authored by Jon Hart | Site metasploit.com
This Metasploit module identifies NTP servers which permit "reslist" queries and obtains the list of restrictions placed on various network interfaces, networks or hosts. The reslist feature allows remote attackers to cause a distributed, reflected denial of service (aka, "DRDoS" or traffic amplification) via spoofed requests. The more interfaces, networks or hosts with specific restrictions, the greater the amplification. requests.

Chargen Probe Utility
Posted Aug 31, 2024
Authored by Matteo Cantoni | Site metasploit.com
Chargen is a debugging and measurement tool and a character generator service. A character generator service simply sends data without regard to the input. Chargen is susceptible to spoofing the source of transmissions as well as use in a reflection attack vector. The misuse of the testing features of the Chargen service may allow attackers to craft malicious network payloads and reflect them by spoofing the transmission source to effectively direct it to a target. This can result in traffic loops and service degradation with large amounts of network traffic.

Native DNS Spoofer
Posted Aug 31, 2024
Authored by RageLtMan | Site metasploit.com
This Metasploit module provides a Rex based DNS service to resolve queries intercepted via the capture mixin. Configure STATIC_ENTRIES to contain host-name mappings desired for spoofing using a hostsfile or space/semicolon separated entries. In the default configuration, the service operates as a normal native DNS server with the exception of consuming from and writing to the wire as opposed to a listening socket. Best when compromising routers or spoofing L2 in order to prevent return of the real reply which causes a race condition. The method by which replies are filtered is up to the user (though iptables works fine).

NetBIOS Name Service Spoofer
Posted Aug 31, 2024
Authored by Jay Turla | Site metasploit.com
This Metasploit module forges NetBIOS Name Service (NBNS) responses. It will listen for NBNS requests sent to the local subnets broadcast address and spoof a response, redirecting the querying machine to an IP of the attackers choosing. Combined with auxiliary/server/capture/smb or auxiliary/server/capture/http_ntlm it is a highly effective means of collecting crackable hashes on common networks. This Metasploit module must be run as root and will bind to udp/137 on all interfaces.

NetBIOS Response Brute Force Spoof
Posted Aug 31, 2024
Authored by H D Moore, TombKeeper, vvalien | Site metasploit.com
This Metasploit module continuously spams NetBIOS responses to a target for given hostname, causing the target to cache a malicious address for this name. On high-speed local networks, the PPSRATE value should be increased to speed up this attack. As an example, a value of around 30,000 is almost 100% successful when spoofing a response for a WPAD lookup. Distant targets may require more time and lower rates for a successful attack.

NetBIOS Response BadTunnel Brute Force Spoof (NAT Tunnel)
Posted Aug 31, 2024
Authored by H D Moore, TombKeeper, vvalien | Site metasploit.com
This Metasploit module listens for a NetBIOS name request and then continuously spams NetBIOS responses to a target for given hostname, causing the target to cache a malicious address for this name. On high-speed networks, the PPSRATE value should be increased to speed up this attack. As an example, a value of around 30,000 is almost 100% successful when spoofing a response for a WPAD lookup. Distant targets may require more time and lower rates for a successful attack. This Metasploit module works when the target is behind a NAT gateway, since the stream of NetBIOS responses will keep the NAT mapping alive after the initial setup. To trigger the initial NetBIOS request to the Metasploit system, force the target to access a UNC link pointing to the same address (HTML, Office attachment, etc). This NAT-piercing issue was named the BadTunnel vulnerability by the discoverer, Yu Yang (@tombkeeper). The Microsoft patches (MS16-063/MS16-077) impact the way that the proxy host (WPAD) host is identified, but do change the predictability of NetBIOS requests.

NTP.org ntpd Reserved Mode Denial of Service
Posted Aug 31, 2024
Authored by todb | Site metasploit.com
This Metasploit module exploits a denial of service vulnerability within the NTP (network time protocol) demon. By sending a single packet to a vulnerable ntpd server (Victim A), spoofed from the IP address of another vulnerable ntpd server (Victim B), both victims will enter an infinite response loop. Note, unless you control the spoofed source host or the real remote host(s), you will not be able to halt the DoS condition once begun!
