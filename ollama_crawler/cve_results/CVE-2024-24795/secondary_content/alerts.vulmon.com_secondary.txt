Simple and Effective Vulnerability Identification Approach
                        Vulnerability scanners are great tools to identify vulnerabilities, but they have drawbacks. Weekly or monthly vulnerability scanning routines cause long latencies on vulnerability identification. Additionally, vulnerability scanning processes usually fail to scan software like web browsers, pdf readers, or word processors. And some hosts in IT infrastructure are not reachable by vulnerability scanners.
Vulmon Alerts' proactive vulnerability identification approach lets you be aware of critical vulnerabilities without vulnerability scanning. Vulmon Alerts provide instant software vulnerability alerts. So you get notified about newly published vulnerabilities that affect your infrastructure in minutes.

Daily Vulnerability Trends
Thousands of vulnerabilities are published every year, but few of them attract the attention
                            of cybersecurity researchers.
                            The Daily Vulnerability Trends feature informs you of the vulnerabilities being discussed in
                            the cybersecurity community. 

                            Daily vulnerability trends keep you up to date on the most significant vulnerabilities. This
                            daily information aids
                            in your decision-making process on vulnerability assessment and on more strategic decisions,
                            like product procurement.
