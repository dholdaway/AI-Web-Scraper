GNUnet P2P Framework 0.22.1
Posted Oct 16, 2024
Authored by Christian Grothoff | Site ovmj.org
GNUnet is a peer-to-peer framework with focus on providing security. All peer-to-peer messages in the network are confidential and authenticated. The framework provides a transport abstraction layer and can currently encapsulate the network traffic in UDP (IPv4 and IPv6), TCP (IPv4 and IPv6), HTTP, or SMTP messages. GNUnet supports accounting to provide contributing nodes with better service. The primary service build on top of the framework is anonymous file sharing.
Changes: Various updates. See their git changelog for a full breakdown.

Acronis Cyber Infrastructure Default Password Remote Code Execution
Posted Oct  3, 2024
Authored by h00die-gr3y, Acronis International GmbH | Site metasploit.com
Acronis Cyber Infrastructure (ACI) is an IT infrastructure solution that provides storage, compute, and network resources. Businesses and Service Providers are using it for data storage, backup storage, creating and managing virtual machines and software-defined networks, running cloud-native applications in production environments. This Metasploit module exploits a default password vulnerability in ACI which allow an attacker to access the ACI PostgreSQL database and gain administrative access to the ACI Web Portal. This opens the door for the attacker to upload SSH keys that enables root access to the appliance/server. This attack can be remotely executed over the WAN as long as the PostgreSQL and SSH services are exposed to the outside world. ACI versions 5.0 before build 5.0.1-61, 5.1 before build 5.1.1-71, 5.2 before build 5.2.1-69, 5.3 before build 5.3.1-53, and 5.4 before build 5.4.4-132 are vulnerable.
