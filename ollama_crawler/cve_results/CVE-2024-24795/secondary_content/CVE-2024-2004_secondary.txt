CVE-2024-2004


Status Candidate
OverviewWhen a protocol selection parameter option disables all protocols without adding any then the default set of protocols would remain in the allowed set due to an error in the logic for removing protocols. The below command would perform a request to curl.se with a plaintext protocol which has been explicitly disabled. curl --proto -all,-http http://curl.se The flaw is only present if the set of selected protocols disables the entire set of available protocols, in itself a command with no practical use and therefore unlikely to be encountered in real situations. The curl security team has thus assessed this to be low severity bug.

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-6718-3
Posted Apr 29, 2024
Authored by Ubuntu | Site security.ubuntu.com
Ubuntu Security Notice 6718-3 - USN-6718-1 fixed vulnerabilities in curl. This update provides the corresponding updates for Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. Dan Fandrich discovered that curl would incorrectly use the default set of protocols when a parameter option disabled all protocols without adding any, contrary to expectations. This issue only affected Ubuntu 23.10. It was discovered that curl incorrectly handled memory when limiting the amount of headers when HTTP/2 server push is allowed. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause curl to consume resources, leading to a denial of service.
