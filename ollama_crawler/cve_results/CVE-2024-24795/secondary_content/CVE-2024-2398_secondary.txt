CVE-2024-2398


Status Candidate
OverviewWhen an application tells libcurl it wants to allow HTTP/2 server push, and the amount of received headers for the push surpasses the maximum allowed limit (1000), libcurl aborts the server push. When aborting, libcurl inadvertently does not free all the previously allocated headers and instead leaks the memory. Further, this error condition fails silently and is therefore not easily detected by an application.

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-6718-3
Posted Apr 29, 2024
Authored by Ubuntu | Site security.ubuntu.com
Ubuntu Security Notice 6718-3 - USN-6718-1 fixed vulnerabilities in curl. This update provides the corresponding updates for Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. Dan Fandrich discovered that curl would incorrectly use the default set of protocols when a parameter option disabled all protocols without adding any, contrary to expectations. This issue only affected Ubuntu 23.10. It was discovered that curl incorrectly handled memory when limiting the amount of headers when HTTP/2 server push is allowed. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause curl to consume resources, leading to a denial of service.
