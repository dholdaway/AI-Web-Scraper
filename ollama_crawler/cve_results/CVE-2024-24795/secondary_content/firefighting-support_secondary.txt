Firefighting Support



            The best self-managed alternative to Canonical Managed Services. Get engineers on call to help you resolve the most critical issues, while continuing to manage your own environments.
          

Enhance your cloud support now













Alternative to direct management



          Whether you're running OpenStack or Kubeflow, operation management can be tough. That's why Canonical offers fully managed services, which relieve you of that worry. However, be it due to security regulations or other issues, giving our engineers access to your environments is not something you can always do.
        

          This is why we launched Firefighting Support, a package that gives you dual, highly-enhanced cloud support from Canonical's Support and Managed Solutions engineering teams.
        

          You thus get managed service-level security and peace of mind, while still completely managing your environments by yourself.
        














Key benefits



          We've designed Firefighting Support to give you a level of cloud support as close as possible to a fully managed service

            Is Firefighting Support
            
            right for you?
          



            Firefighting Support is a useful tool in most circumstances. Nevertheless, we've created the service to address three key fields:
          































Government clouds

              Generally, governments and intergovernmental institutions have very stringent regulations that forbid third parties from providing direct operational management. This, however, does not make your operations easier. Firefighting Support gives you extra peace of mind while allowing you to remain fully compliant with your security policies.
            



Highly private telecommunications networks

              There are telco networks that even the most secure third parties can't touch. But managing their workloads can be tough, especially for emerging teams. Canonical's Firefighting Support can allow your private networks to operate more smoothly by having your back in urgent situations.
            



Cloud upgrades

              It's time to upgrade your cloud to the newest version, and it's rightfully intimidating. Consider Firefighting Support, so you can benefit from the expertise and experience of our Managed Solutions engineers, who will help you immediately fix any issues that arise during the upgrade.

FAQ




What's the difference between Firefighting Support and Ubuntu Pro support?



              Firefighting Support is an enhanced level of security that includes Ubuntu Pro. You get better SLAs and an additional team that understands your environment before helping you in high-severity incidents. You still get all the benefits of Ubuntu Pro, and then some.
            





Can I get Firefighting Support if I already have Ubuntu Pro?



              Yes, you can. Your cloud may need to undergo a cloud validation from our team, and you will only pay an additional upgrade fee.
            





How much does it cost?



              This depends on the products you want to cover and the number of nodes. Our pricing model is simple,  intuitive, and works on a per node per year basis. Get in touch with our team to find out more.
            





Which products does Firefighting Support cover?



              Firefighting Support covers Charmed OpenStack, Canonical Kubernetes, as well as our entire Managed Apps portfolio.
            










Unlock Ops Consulting



            Want to discuss your tech plans in more depth? Curious about how you can start managing your environments yourself? Or do you simply want to learn more about the products in your stack?
          

            Talk to Canonical Managed Solutions engineers through Ops Consulting, a package that gives you access to one-to-one calls with our topic experts.
          































Upgrade support

              We understand that upgrading infrastructure or apps can be challenging. If we can't upgrade it for you via Managed Services, you can still discuss the best upgrade practices with our engineers through Ops Consulting and get guidance on how to do it yourself.
            



Operational experience

              If there are topics that give you headaches when managing your environments, our engineers can advise you on how to avoid common mistakes and how to fix recurrent problems. We've been managing environments for over a decade, so we've always got insightful tips.
            



Team training

              Have you already benefited from our Managed Solutions offering, and feel confident to take over the reins and manage your environments by yourself? We've still got you covered, with training material and best practices to be shared in consulting sessions.
            










Ops Consulting packages



            You can access Ops Consulting regardless of the size of your infrastructure or current projects, as long as you've got one of our Firefighting Support or fully managed services active.
          

            We offer three packages that give you a number of consulting hours you can book in a month to discuss topics of your choice with our engineers. The hours do not roll over, but you never have to commit for more than a month.
