vcswatch reports that

the current version of the package is not in its VCS.
Either you need to push your commits and/or your tags, or the information about
the package's VCS are out of date. A common cause of the latter issue when
using the Git VCS is not specifying the correct branch when the packaging is
not in the default one (remote HEAD branch), which is usually "master" but can
be modified in salsa.debian.org in the project's general settings with the
"Default Branch" field). Alternatively the Vcs-Git field in debian/control can
contain a "-b <branch-name>" suffix to indicate what branch is used
for the Debian packaging.

Among the 10 debian patches
available in version 2.4.62-3 of the package,
we noticed the following issues:

3 patches
    where the metadata indicates that the patch has not yet been forwarded

    metadata to document its real status.

The package should be updated to follow the last version of Debian Policy
(Standards-Version 4.7.0 instead of
4.6.2).
