(CVE-2023-31122)  - Faulty input validation in the core of Apache allows malicious or exploitable backend/content generators     to split HTTP responses. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server: through 2.4.58. (CVE-2023-38709)  - An attacker, opening a HTTP/2 connection with an initial window size of 0, was able to block handling of     that connection indefinitely in Apache HTTP Server. This could be used to exhaust worker resources in the     server, similar to the well known slow loris attack pattern. This has been fixed in version 2.4.58, so     that such connection are terminated properly after the configured connection timeout. This issue affects     Apache HTTP Server: from 2.4.55 through 2.4.57. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which     fixes the issue. (CVE-2023-43622)  - When a HTTP/2 stream was reset (RST frame) by a client, there was a time window were the request's memory     resources were not reclaimed immediately. Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection close. A     client could send new requests and resets, keeping the connection busy and open and causing the memory     footprint to keep on growing. On connection close, all resources were reclaimed, but the process might run     out of memory before that. This was found by the reporter during testing of CVE-2023-44487 (HTTP/2 Rapid     Reset Exploit) with their own test client. During normal HTTP/2 use, the probability to hit this bug is     very low. The kept memory would not become noticeable before the connection closes or times out. Users are     recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue. (CVE-2023-45802)  - HTTP Response splitting in multiple modules in Apache HTTP Server allows an attacker that can inject     malicious response headers into backend applications to cause an HTTP desynchronization attack. Users are     recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.59, which fixes this issue. (CVE-2024-24795)  - HTTP/2 incoming headers exceeding the limit are temporarily buffered in nghttp2 in order to generate an     informative HTTP 413 response. If a client does not stop sending headers, this leads to memory exhaustion.    (CVE-2024-27316)Note that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.SolutionUpgrade the apache2 packages.See Alsohttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/apache2https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-31122https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-38709https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-43622https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-45802https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-24795https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-27316https://packages.debian.org/source/bookworm/apache2https://packages.debian.org/source/bullseye/apache2Plugin DetailsSeverity: HighID: 193369File Name: debian_DSA-5662.naslVersion: 1.2Type: localAgent: unixFamily: Debian Local Security ChecksPublished: 4/16/2024Updated: 7/12/2024Supported Sensors: Frictionless Assessment Agent, Nessus Agent, Agentless Assessment, NessusRisk InformationVPRRisk Factor: MediumScore: 4.4CVSS v2Risk Factor: HighBase Score: 7.8Temporal Score: 5.8Vector: CVSS2#AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:CCVSS Score Source: CVE-2024-27316CVSS v3Risk Factor: HighBase Score: 7.5Temporal Score: 6.5Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:HTemporal Vector: CVSS:3.0/E:U/RL:O/RC:CVulnerability InformationCPE: cpe:/o:debian:debian_linux:11.0, p-cpe:/a:debian:debian_linux:apache2-data, p-cpe:/a:debian:debian_linux:apache2-suexec-custom, p-cpe:/a:debian:debian_linux:apache2-utils, p-cpe:/a:debian:debian_linux:libapache2-mod-md, p-cpe:/a:debian:debian_linux:apache2-suexec-pristine, p-cpe:/a:debian:debian_linux:apache2-bin, p-cpe:/a:debian:debian_linux:libapache2-mod-proxy-uwsgi, p-cpe:/a:debian:debian_linux:apache2-doc, p-cpe:/a:debian:debian_linux:apache2-dev, p-cpe:/a:debian:debian_linux:apache2-ssl-dev, cpe:/o:debian:debian_linux:12.0, p-cpe:/a:debian:debian_linux:apache2Required KB Items: Host/local_checks_enabled, Host/Debian/release, Host/Debian/dpkg-lExploit Ease: No known exploits are availablePatch Publication Date: 4/16/2024Vulnerability Publication Date: 10/19/2023Reference InformationCVE: CVE-2023-31122, CVE-2023-38709, CVE-2023-43622, CVE-2023-45802, CVE-2024-24795, CVE-2024-27316IAVA: 2023-A-0572-S, 2024-A-0202-STenable.comCommunity & SupportDocumentationEducation© 2024 Tenable®, Inc.
