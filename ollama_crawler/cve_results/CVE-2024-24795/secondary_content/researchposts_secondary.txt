Vulmon:
CVE-2023-6246                


A newly discovered heap-based buffer overflow in the glibc's __vsyslog_internal() function, called by syslog() and vsyslog(), poses a significant security risk. Identified as CVE-2023-6246, this vulnerability was inadvertently introduced in glibc versions 2.37 and backported to 2.36.

**Impact:**
- Allows for Local Privilege Escalation to root from an unprivileged user.
- Affects common distributions like Debian 12 & 13, Ubuntu 23.04 & 23.10, and Fedora 37 to 39.
- Requires local network access; remote exploitation is highly unlikely.

**Mitigation:**
- Review and apply necessary patches immediately.
- Monitor system logs for unusual activities.
