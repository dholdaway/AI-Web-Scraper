Background
 Apache HTTP Server is a widely used open-source web server software. It provides a secure and efficient platform for hosting websites and applications. The vulnerability affects version 2.4.60 of Apache HTTP Server in the Bitnami ecosystem. This version contains a regression that mishandles the legacy content-type based configuration of handlers. Specifically, the 'AddType' and similar configurations can result in the disclosure of local content source code when files are requested indirectly. This can lead to the unintended serving of PHP scripts instead of their interpretation.
Vulnerability Detail 
 The vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.60 allows for source code disclosure of local content. When certain files are requested indirectly, the server may serve them as-is, revealing the underlying source code. This can be particularly problematic for PHP scripts, as they may be exposed instead of being properly interpreted. The issue arises due to a regression in the core of Apache HTTP Server. It is important to note that this vulnerability only affects version 2.4.60 of Apache HTTP Server in the Bitnami ecosystem.
Conclusion

The regression in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.60 can result in the source code disclosure of local content when certain files are requested indirectly. This vulnerability affects version 2.4.60 of Apache HTTP Server in the Bitnami ecosystem. Users are advised to upgrade to version 2.4.61 to mitigate the issue and prevent the unintended serving of PHP scripts or other sensitive source code. For a thorough exploration and assistance in countering such issues, consult the Vulert Vulnerability Database.
