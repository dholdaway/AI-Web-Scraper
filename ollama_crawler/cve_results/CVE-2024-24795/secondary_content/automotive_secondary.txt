Safety-critical & Mixed-criticality ECUs

          Canonical is part of the SOAFEE consortium as well as the Eclipse SDV working group, which are at the forefront of defining the reference architecture for mixed-criticality and safety.
        
Canonical is also contributing to ISO26262 to enable automotive functional safety.

          Vehicles need to have the fastest response time to guarantee functional safety. With Real-time Ubuntu, our Linux kernel integrates PREEMPT_RT and guarantees low-latency response time.
