As part of the security fix, the Apache webserver     mod_cgi module has stopped relaying the Content-Length field     of the HTTP reply header from the CGI programs back to the client     in cases where the connection is to be closed and the client     is able to read until end-of-file.    Fossil was fixed by reading the whole input,     re-allocating the input buffer to fit as more input is received,     instead of trusting the CONTENT_LENGTH variable.    For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version     1:2.8-1+deb10u1.    We recommend that you upgrade your fossil packages.
