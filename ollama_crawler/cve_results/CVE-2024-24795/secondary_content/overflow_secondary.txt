Posted Oct 18, 2024
Authored by Charles FOL, jheysel-r7, Heyder, Sergey Temnikov | Site metasploit.com
This Metasploit module uses a combination of an arbitrary file read (CVE-2024-34102) and a buffer overflow in glibc (CVE-2024-2961). It allows for unauthenticated remote code execution on various versions of Magento and Adobe Commerce (and earlier versions if the PHP and glibc versions are also vulnerable). Versions affected include 2.4.7 and earlier, 2.4.6-p5 and earlier, 2.4.5-p7 and earlier, and 2.4.4-p8 and earlier.
