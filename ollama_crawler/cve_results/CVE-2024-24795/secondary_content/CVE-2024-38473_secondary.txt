Ubuntu Security Notice USN-6885-2
Posted Jul 12, 2024
Authored by Ubuntu | Site security.ubuntu.com
Ubuntu Security Notice 6885-2 - USN-6885-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Apache HTTP Server. One of the security fixes introduced a regression when proxying requests to a HTTP/2 server. This update fixes the problem. Marc Stern discovered that the Apache HTTP Server incorrectly handled serving WebSocket protocol upgrades over HTTP/2 connections. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause the server to crash, resulting in a denial of service. Orange Tsai discovered that the Apache HTTP Server mod_proxy module incorrectly sent certain request URLs with incorrect encodings to backends. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass authentication. Orange Tsai discovered that the Apache HTTP Server mod_rewrite module incorrectly handled certain substitutions. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to execute scripts in directories not directly reachable by any URL, or cause a denial of service. Some environments may require using the new UnsafeAllow3F flag to handle unsafe substitutions. Orange Tsai discovered that the Apache HTTP Server incorrectly handled certain response headers. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive information, execute local scripts, or perform SSRF attacks. Orange Tsai discovered that the Apache HTTP Server mod_proxy module incorrectly handled certain requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause the server to crash, resulting in a denial of service. It was discovered that the Apache HTTP Server incorrectly handled certain handlers configured via AddType. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain source code.
