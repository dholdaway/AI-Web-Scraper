General Information


				The NVD is the U.S. government repository of standards based vulnerability 
				management data represented using the Security Content Automation Protocol 
				(SCAP). This data enables automation of vulnerability management, security 
				measurement, and compliance. The NVD includes databases of security checklist 
				references, security related software flaws, product names, 
				and impact metrics.
			

				Originally created in 1999 (called Internet - Categorization of Attacks Toolkit 
				or ICAT), the NVD has undergone multiple iterations and improvements and will 
				continue to do so to deliver its services. The NVD is a product of the NIST 
				Computer Security Division, Information Technology Laboratory.
			

				The NVD performs enrichment on CVEs that have been published to the CVE List. 
				NVD staff are tasked with enrichment of CVEs by aggregating data points from the 
				description, references supplied and any supplemental data that can be found 
				publicly at the time. This enrichment results in association impact metrics (Common 
				Vulnerability Scoring System - CVSS), vulnerability types (Common Weakness 
				Enumeration - CWE), and applicability statements (Common Platform Enumeration - 
				CPE), as well as other pertinent metadata. The NVD does not actively perform 
				vulnerability testing, relying on vendors, third party security researchers and 
				vulnerability coordinators to provide information that is then used to assign these 
				attributes. As additional information becomes available CVSS assessments, CWEs, and 
				applicability statements are subject to change. The NVD endeavors to re-assess CVEs 
				that have been amended as time and resources allow to ensure that the information 
				offered is up to date.
