Cyber SecurityCyber Security NewsVulnerability Critical Chrome Security Update: Patch for Out-of-Bounds & WebRTC Vulnerability

By Guru Baran -   October 30, 2024 



 





Google has rolled out a critical security update for its Chrome browser, addressing significant vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit.
The update brings the Stable channel to versions 130.0.6723.91/.92 for Windows and Mac and 130.0.6723.91 for Linux.


Similarly, the Extended Stable channel has been updated to 130.0.6723.92 for Windows and Mac, with the rollout expected to be completed over the coming days and weeks.

This update is crucial as it addresses two major security vulnerabilities reported by external researchers:
Critical CVE-2024-10487: Out-of-Bounds Write in Dawn

One of the vulnerabilities, identified as CVE-2024-10487, involves an “out-of-bounds write” in the Dawn graphics system.
If exploited, this flaw could allow attackers to write data beyond the allocated memory, potentially leading to code execution or system crashes. Apple Security Engineering and Architecture (SEAR) reported the issue on October 23, 2024.
High CVE-2024-10488: Use After Free in WebRTC
The second vulnerability, CVE-2024-10488, is a “use after free” issue within Chrome’s WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) component.
Cassidy Kim reported this bug on October 18, 2024. A “use after free” vulnerability is particularly dangerous as it can lead to the execution of arbitrary code or cause a crash by accessing memory that has already been freed.
The out-of-bounds write vulnerability in Dawn is particularly severe because it can allow remote code execution, which attackers can leverage to gain control over affected systems.
The use-after-free vulnerability in WebRTC also poses a high risk as it could be exploited to manipulate browser memory, leading to potential data breaches or system crashes.
These vulnerabilities highlight the ongoing challenges in web security. Even widely used platforms like Chrome are not immune to critical flaws that require prompt attention and patching.
Google has proactively addressed these issues by collaborating with security researchers who identified these vulnerabilities during the development cycle.
This collaboration is part of Google’s broader strategy to enhance security measures and prevent such vulnerabilities from reaching the stable channel.
Users are strongly advised to update their Chrome browsers immediately to mitigate any potential risks associated with these vulnerabilities.
The update process can be initiated manually through Chrome’s settings under “About Google Chrome,” where users can check for updates and install them if available.
Chrome will automatically check for updates and install the latest version. You may be prompted to restart the browser to complete the update process.
This latest update underscores the importance of regular software updates as a critical component of cybersecurity hygiene. By staying updated, users can protect themselves from known vulnerabilities that malicious actors could otherwise exploit.

It has been an interesting few days for Apple’s Security Engineering and Architecture (SEAR) team. Last week, SEAR unveiled its Private Cloud Compute challenge for hackers to secure $1m by breaking its new, “game-changing” AI platform—a major threat to Android’s equivalent. And now there’s an unexpected twist, with that same Apple security team triggering an emergency update for 2 billion Chrome users.


On Tuesday, Google updated Chrome’s stable release for Windows and Mac to 130.0.6723.91/.92. There were two security updates, the first being CVE-2024-10487, the critical flaw disclosed by Apple, and the second being CVE-2024-10488, a lower-risk WebRTC flaw disclosed by a private researcher.
ForbesSamsung’s Impossible Deadline—You Have 24 Hours To Update Your PhoneBy Zak Doffman

The threat exposed by Apple’s team is an “out of bounds write in Dawn.” If exploited this could allow hackers to access system memory outside the set parameters, prompting application or system crashes. This was reported by Apple less than a week prior to the update, which equates to an emergency update for users.

Attacks leveraging this flaw would be executed by way of a maliciously crafted webpage, with users lured by way of links in emails, messages or social media posts. It would be highly likely to be exploited as part of a chain, opening a device to the risks of immediate data theft or the installation of longer-term malware.

Addressing such risks is a monthly game of cat and mouse for Google, as we saw with the news this week that a researcher has now released a tool to bypass Google’s latest encryption technology to better protect security cookies on devices. These security cookies allow users to log into websites without re-entering credentials, and cookie theft is the kind of attack that might exploit these latest memory vulnerabilities.


Ironically, Google’s addition of this technology to Chrome for Windows mirrors the existing security that Apple operates on macOS. Given the level of privileges required to beat the new technology, Google remains confident it has raised the bar.ForbesApple Unveils ‘Groundbreaking’ iPhone Update—Samsung Has A Serious New ProblemBy Zak Doffman
As ever, there is no further detail on the new threats at this time. Google explains that “Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.”
Given this was disclosed by Apple’s high-end security team and has been so rapidly fixed, all users should check that the update has been downloaded, and then restart Chrome to ensure it installs properly. Update instructions can be found here.

                · Updated October 29, 2024


 



Google has just released an urgent update for its Chrome browser, addressing two serious security vulnerabilities that could potentially allow attackers to take control of users’ systems. The vulnerabilities, identified as CVE-2024-10487 and CVE-2024-10488, affect Chrome across Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms.
CVE-2024-10487, rated as Critical, involves an “out of bounds write” vulnerability in the Dawn graphics library. This type of flaw can allow attackers to corrupt memory and potentially execute malicious code on the user’s device. The vulnerability was reported by Apple Security Engineering and Architecture (SEAR) on October 23rd, highlighting the collaborative effort in cybersecurity across tech giants.
CVE-2024-10488, classified as High, is a “use after free” vulnerability in WebRTC, the technology powering real-time communication in Chrome. This vulnerability could enable attackers to exploit a freed memory space, leading to crashes or, in more severe cases, arbitrary code execution. Security researcher Cassidy Kim (@cassidy6564) is credited with discovering and reporting this vulnerability on October 18th.
The updates, versions 130.0.6723.91/.92 for Windows and Mac, and 130.0.6723.91 for Linux, are rolling out to users over the coming days and weeks. The Extended Stable channel has also been updated to 130.0.6723.92 for Windows and Mac.
Google urges all users to update their Chrome browsers as soon as possible to mitigate these security risks. To update, users can navigate to “Help” -> “About Google Chrome” within their browser. Chrome will automatically check for and install the latest updates.
