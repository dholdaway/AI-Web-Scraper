Cyber Security News ¬Æ Critical Chrome Security Update | Discover more: https://lnkd.in/gXmacghU

One of the vulnerabilities, identified as¬†CVE-2024-10487, involves an ‚Äúout-of-bounds write‚Äù in the Dawn graphics system.

If exploited, this flaw could allow attackers to write data beyond the allocated memory, potentially leading to code execution or system crashes. Apple Security Engineering and Architecture (SEAR) reported the issue on October 23, 2024.

The second vulnerability,¬†CVE-2024-10488, is a ‚Äúuse after free‚Äù issue within Chrome‚Äôs¬†WebRTC¬†(Web Real-Time Communication) component.

Cassidy Kim reported this bug on October 18, 2024. A ‚Äúuse after free‚Äù vulnerability is particularly dangerous as it can lead to the execution of arbitrary code or cause a crash by accessing memory that has already been freed.
