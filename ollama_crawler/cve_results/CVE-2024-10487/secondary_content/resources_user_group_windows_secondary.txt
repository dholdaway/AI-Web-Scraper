Using user and group on
         Windows


Use the built-in user and group resource types to manage user and group accounts on Windows.
Managing local user and group resources

Puppet uses the user and group resource
            types to manage local accounts. You can’t write a Puppet resource that describes a domain user or
            group. However, a local group resource can manage
            which domain accounts belong to the local group. 

Managing group membership with Puppet


Windows manages group membership by specifying the groups
            to which a user belongs, or by specifying the members of a group. Puppet supports both of these methods.
When Puppet is managing a local user, you can list
            the groups that the user belongs to. These groups can be a local group account
            (such as Administrators) or a domain group
            account.
When Puppet is managing a local group, you can list
            the members that belong to the group. Each member can be a local account (such
               as Administrator) or a domain account, where
            each account can be a user or a group account.
When managing a user, Puppet makes sure that the
            user belongs to all of the groups listed in the manifest. If the user belongs
            to a group not specified in the manifest, Puppet does not
            remove the user from the group.
If you want to ensure that a user belongs to only the groups listed
            in the manifest, and no others, specify the membership attribute for the user. If set to inclusive, Puppet removes the
            user from any group not listed in the manifest.
Similarly, when managing a group, Puppet makes sure
            all of the members listed in the manifest are added to the group. Existing
            members of the group who are not listed in the manifest are ignored. 
To ensure that a group contains only the members listed in the
            manifest, and no others, specify the auth_membership attribute for the group. When this attribute is
            present and set to true, Puppet removes any members of the group not listed in the
            manifest.

Allowed user attributes on Windows

When managing Windows user accounts, you can use the
            following 
user resource
            type attributes: 







Attribute
Usage notes




name



ensure



comment



groups
You cannot use the gid attribute with
                              Windows. 


home



managehome



membership



password
Passwords must be specified in cleartext, because Windows does not have an API for setting
                           the password hash. 


auth_membership



uid

Read-only. Available for inspecting a user by running puppet resource user <NAME>. The uid value will be the user’s SID (see
                           below).





Allowed group attributes on Windows

When managing Windows group accounts, you can use
            the following group resource type attributes: 







Attribute
Usage notes




name



ensure



members




auth_membership




gid

Read-only. Available for inspecting a group by running puppet resource group <NAME>. The
                              gid value will be the group’s SID (see
                           below).





Names and security identifiers (SIDs)
On Windows, user and group account names can take
            multiple forms, such as: 


Administrators




<host>\Administrators




BUILTIN\Administrators




S-1-5-32-544


The S-1-5-32-544 name form is called a security
            identifier (SID). Puppet treats all these forms equally:
            when comparing two account names, it transforms account names into their canonical SID
            form and compares the SIDs.
When you refer to a user or group in multiple places in a manifest (such as when
               creating relationships between resources), be consistent with how
            you capitalize the name. Names are case-sensitive in Puppet manifests, but case-insensitive on Windows. It’s
            important that the cases match, however, because autorequire will attempt to match users
            with fully qualified names (such as User[BUILTIN\Administrators]) in addition to SIDs (such as User[S-1-5-32-544]). It might not match in cases where domain
            accounts and local accounts have the same name, such as Domain\Bob versus LOCAL\Bob.


Note: When listed for reporting or by puppet
                  resource, groups always return the fully qualified form when describing a
               user, such as BUILTIN\Administrators. These
               fully qualified names might not look the same as in the names specified in the
               manifest.
