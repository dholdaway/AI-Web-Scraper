Metaparameter reference

Metaparameters are attributes that work with any resource type, including custom
        types and defined types. They change the way Puppet handles
        resources.

With metaparameters, you can change how Puppet handles
                specific resources. For example, you can: 
Add metadata to a resource with the alias or
                            tag metaparameters.
Set limits on when the resource should be applied, by using relationship
                        metaparameters like notify or require.
Prevent Puppet from making changes, by
                        setting the noop metaparameter.
Change logging verbosity with the loglevel
                        metaparameter.



alias
Creates an alias for the resource. You can explicitly specify the alias
                metaparameter, but it's usually safer to give the resource the alias value as the
                title and provide the full namevar value explicitly. 
For example, this sample gives the title as sshdconfig, which acts as the alias. The namevar value is the path,
                which is set to '/etc/ssh/sshd_config'.file { 'sshdconfig': 
  path => '/etc/ssh/sshd_config',
  source => '...'
}

service { 'sshd': 
  subscribe => File['sshdconfig'],
}


Aliases generally work only for creating relationships; anything else that refers to
                an existing resource (such as amending or overriding resource attributes in an
                inherited class) must use the resource's exact title. For example, the following
                code will not work, because there's no way for Puppet
                to know that the two stanzas should affect the same file.
                file { '/etc/ssh/sshd_config': 
  owner => root,
  group => root,
  alias => 'sshdconfig',
 }

File['sshdconfig'] {
  mode => '0644',
}


audit
Marks a subset of this resource's unmanaged attributes for auditing. Accepts an
                attribute name, an array of attribute names, or the value all.
When audit is set for an attribute, when Puppet
                applies the catalog, it checks whether that attribute of the resource has been
                modified, comparing its current value to the previous run. Any change is then logged
                alongside any actions Puppet performed while applying
                the catalog.

before
Specifies one or more resources that depend on this resource, expressed as resource
                references. Specify multiple resources as an array of references. When specified,
                    before causes the resource to be applied before
                the dependent resources. This is one of the four relationship metaparameters, along
                with require, notify, and subscribe. For more
                information about creating relationships between resources, see Relationships and ordering. For details about resource references, see
                    Resource and class references.

loglevel
Sets the level at which information is logged. The log levels have the biggest impact
                when logs are sent to syslog, which is the default log. Any of the log levels are
                valid values for this metaparameter. The order of the log levels, in decreasing
                priority, is: 
emerg
alert
crit
err
warning
notice
info
verbose
debug



noop
Whether to apply this resource in non-operational, or "no-op" mode. When applying a
                resource in noop mode, Puppet checks whether the resource is in the desired
                state as declared in the catalog. If the resource is not in the desired state, Puppet takes no action, but reports the changes it
                would have made. These simulated changes appear in the report sent to the primary
                server or are displayed be shown on the console if running puppet agent or puppet
                apply in the foreground. The simulated changes do not send refresh events to any
                subscribing or notified resources, although Puppet
                logs that a refresh event would have been sent. Valid values are true or false.


Note: The noop setting allows you to globally enable or disable noop mode, but it
                    does not override the noop metaparameter on
                    individual resources. That is, the value of a global noop setting affects only resources that do not have an explicit
                    value set for their noop attribute. 


notify
Specifies one or more resources that depend on this resource, expressed as resource
                references. Specify multiple resources as an array of references.
When this attribute is set, this resource is applied before the notified resources.
                If Puppet makes changes to this resource, it causes
                all of the notified resources to refresh. Refresh behavior varies by resource type:
                for example, services restart and mounts unmount and re-mount. Not all types can
                refresh. 
This is one of the four relationship metaparameters, along with before, require, and
                    subscribe. For more information about creating
                relationships between resources, see Relationships and ordering. For
                details about resource references, see Resource and class references.

require
Specifies one or more resources that this resource depends on, expressed as resource
                references. Specify multiple resources as an array of references. 
When this attribute is set, the required resources are applied before this
                resource.
This is one of the four relationship metaparameters, along with before, notify, and
                    subscribe. For more information about creating
                relationships between resources, see Relationships and ordering. For
                details about resource references, see Resource and class references.

schedule
A schedule to govern when Puppet is allowed to manage
                this resource. The value of this metaparameter must be the name of a schedule resource. This
                means you must first declare a schedule resource, then refer to it by name.
For example: schedule { 'everyday': 
  period => daily,
  range  => "2-4"
  }

exec { "/usr/bin/apt-get update": 
  schedule => 'everyday'
}
 You can declare the schedule resource anywhere in your manifests, as long
                as it ends up in the final compiled catalog. 
See the schedule type for more information.

stage
Which run stage this class should reside in. To assign a class to a different stage,
                you must:
Declare the new stage as a stage resource
                        See the stage type for details.
Declare an order relationship between the new stage and the main stage.
Use the resource-like syntax to declare the class, and set the stage metaparameter to the name of the desired
                        stage. 


Important: This metaparameter can only be used on classes, and only
                    when declaring them with the resource-like syntax. It cannot be used on normal
                    resources or on classes declared with include.
                    By default, all classes are declared in the main
                    stage. For example:stage { 'pre': 
  before => Stage['main'],
}

class { 'apt-updates': 
  stage => 'pre',
}


subscribe
Specifies one or more resources that depend on this resource, expressed as resource
                references. Specify multiple resources as an array of references. 
When this attribute is present, the subscribed resources are applied before this
                resource. If Puppet makes changes to any of the
                subscribed resources, it causes this resource to refresh. Refresh behavior varies by
                resource type: for example, services restart and mounts unmount and re-mount. Not
                all types can refresh. 
This is one of the four relationship metaparameters, along with before, require, and
                    notify. For more information about creating
                relationships between resources, see Relationships and ordering. For
                details about resource references, see Resource and class references.

tag
Add the specified tags to the associated resource. Although all resources are
                automatically tagged with as much information as possible, such as with each class
                and definition containing the resource, it can be useful to add your own tags to a
                given resource. Multiple tags can be specified as an array:
                file {'/etc/hosts':
  ensure => file,
  source => 'puppet:///modules/site/hosts',
  mode   => '0644',
  tag    => ['bootstrap', 'minimumrun', 'mediumrun'],
}

Tags are useful for things like applying a subset of a host's configuration with the
                    tags configuration setting, such as with puppet agent --test --tags bootstrap. See the
                configuration reference for more information about the tags setting
