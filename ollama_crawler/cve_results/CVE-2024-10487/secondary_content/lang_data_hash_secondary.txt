Hashes

Hashes map keys to values, maintaining the order of the
      entries according to insertion order.
Syntax
Hashes are written as a pair of curly braces {}
            containing any number of key-value pairs. A key is separated from its value by an arrow
            (sometimes called a fat comma or hash rocket) =>, and
            adjacent pairs are separated by commas. An optional trailing comma is allowed between
            the final value and the closing curly
            brace.{ key1 => 'val1', key2 => 'val2' }
# Equivalent:
{ key1 => 'val1', key2 => 'val2', }

Hash keys can be any data type, but generally, you should use only strings. Put
            quotation marks around keys that are strings. Don't assign a hash with non-string keys
            to a resource attribute or class parameter, because Puppet cannot serialize non-string hash keys into the
            catalog.{ 'key1' => ['val1','val2'], 
  'key2' => {  'key3' =>  'val3',  }, 
  'key4' => true,
  'key5' => 12345,
 }


Accessing values
Access hash members with their key inside square
            brackets:$myhash = { key       => "some value",
            other_key => "some other value" }
notice( $myhash[key] )This example manifest would log some value as a notice.
If you try to access a nonexistent key from a hash, its value is undef:$cool_value = $myhash[absent_key] # Value is undef

Nested arrays and hashes can be accessed by chaining
            indexes:$main_site = { port        => { http  => 80,
                                https => 443 },
               vhost_name  => 'docs.puppetlabs.com',
               server_name => { mirror0 => 'warbler.example.com',
                                mirror1 => 'egret.example.com' }
             }
notice ( $main_site[port][https] )This example manifest would
               log 443 as a notice.

Merging hashes
When hashes are merged (using the addition (+)
            operator), the keys in the constructed hash have the same order as in the original
            hashes, with the left hash keys ordered first, followed by any keys that appeared only
            in the hash on the right side of the merge. 
Where a key exists in both hashes, the merged hash uses the value of the key in the hash
            to the right of the addition operator (+). For
            example:$values = {'a' => 'a', 'b' => 'b'}
$overrides = {'a' => 'overridden'}
$result = $values + $overrides
notice($result)
-> {'a' => 'overridden', 'b' => 'b'}




The Hash data type

The data type of hashes is Hash. By default, Hash matches hashes of any size, as long as
      their keys match the abstract type Scalar and their values match the abstract type Data. You can use parameters to restrict which
         values Hash 
      matches.
Parameters
The full signature for Hash is:Hash[<KEY TYPE>, <VALUE TYPE>, <MIN SIZE>, <MAX SIZE>]These
            parameters are optional. You must specify both key type and value type if
            you’re going to specify one of them. The parameters must be listed in order; if you need
            to specify a later parameter, you must also specify values for any prior ones. 










Position
Parameter
Data type
Default value
Description




1
Key type
Type
Scalar
What kinds of values can be used as keys. If you specify a key
                           type, a value type is mandatory.


2
Value type
Type
Data
What kinds of values can be used as values.


3
Minimum size 
Integer
0
The minimum number of key-value pairs in the hash. This parameter
                           accepts the special value default,
                           which uses its default value. 


4
Maximum size
Integer
infinite
The maximum number of key-value pairs in the hash. This parameter
                           accepts the special value default,
                           which uses its default value. 




Examples: 

Hash

Matches a hash of any length; all keys must match Scalar and any values must match Data. 

Hash[Integer, String]

Matches a hash that uses integers for keys and strings for values.

Hash[Integer, String, 1]

Same as previous, and requires a non-empty hash.

Hash[Integer, String, 1, 8]

Same as previous, and with a maximum size of eight key-value pairs.


The abstract Struct data type lets you
            specify the exact keys allowed in a hash, as well as what value types are allowed for
            each key.
Other abstract types, particularly Variant and Enum, are useful when
            specifying a value type for hashes that include multiple kinds of data.
