Report

This document describes the Puppet master's report endpoint and the schema for
Report Format 6 in technical term. Also see the
documentation.
The report endpoint allows clients to send reports to the master via http
or https. Once received by the master they are processed by the report
processors configured to be triggered when a report is received. As an
example, storing reports in PuppetDB is handled by one such report processor.

Save

The http(s) endpoint for sending reports to the master is:
PUT /puppet/v3/report/:nodename?environment=:environment

Supported HTTP Methods
PUTSupported Format(s)
application/json, text/psonParameters
NoneContent

The content of a report is typically generated by the Puppet Runtime and consists of a JSON serialization of Puppet::Transaction::Report object which in turn contains a structure of objects with of the following runtime types:

Puppet::Util::Log
Puppet::Util::Metric
Puppet::Resource::Status
Puppet::Transaction::Event

This JSON serialization is compliant with the endpoint's report JSON schema.
Example

Here is an example of a PUT request. (Note that the content-length is not correct as the
example is formatted for readability)
PUT /puppet/v3/report/kermit.com?environment=production HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: application/json
