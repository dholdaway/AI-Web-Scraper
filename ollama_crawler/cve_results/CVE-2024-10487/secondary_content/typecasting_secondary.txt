Typecasting

Typecasting is a method for converting data from one data type to another. In many
        cases, you can explicitly typecast into the type you need, but the Puppet language also
        provides shortcuts for common data conversions, as well as support for more complex
        conversions.
Creating a new typed variable
When there's an unambiguous translation between one data type and another, you can
                typecast into the type you need:

$temp   = Float("98.6")       # Cast into a float variable; 98.6
$count  = Integer("42")       # Cast into an integer variable; 42
$bool   = Boolean("false")    # Cast into a boolean false
$string = String(100)         # Cast into the string "100"

You can also typecast between number formats, such as turning a hex number string
                into an
                integer:$intval =  Integer("0xFF")    # Cast into an integer variable; 255

Invoking the data type directly is a shortcut for calling the .new()
                function. For more information, including the conversion rules and options
                available, see the function reference for new().

Automatic coercions
When you use strings in arithmetic, Puppet assumes that you did so intentionally and
                coerces them to the proper types. For
                example:$result = "2" + "2"         # Cast into an integer variable; 4
$multiple = 4 * "25"        # Cast into an integer variable; 100
$float    = "2.75" * 2      # Cast into a float variable; 5.5
$identity = "1024" + 0      # Cast into integer variable; 1024 (direct conversion)When
                you interpolate variables into a string, Puppet converts them to their string
                representation using the most obvious method. If you need an explicit conversion,
                you can manually typecast. For example:$var = 1
notice("The truth value of ${var} is ${Boolean($var)}") # Outputs "The truth value of 1 is true"


Extracting a Number from a String fragment
To convert a string that contains non-numeric characters into a number, for example
                    32º or 9,000,
                you must parse the string. You can parse a string using the scanf function. 
For example:

$input  = "It is 32º outside!"
$format = "It is %iº outside!"
scanf($input, $format)  # returns array of matches;  [32]

$input  = "The melting point of iron is 2,800°F".delete(",")
$format = "The melting point of iron is %i°F"
scanf($input, $format)  # returns array of matches;  [2800]Here are more
                example format conversions:







Conversion
Description of match





%d, %u

Optionally signed decimal integer


%i
Optionally signed integer with auto-detected base 


%o
Optionally signed octal integer



%x, %X

Optionally signed hexadecimal integer


%s
String, or a sequence of non-white-space characters


%c
A single character 


%%
A % character 





Converting to a Boolean
You can cast case-insensitive strings of true/false, yes/no, non-zero/0,
                and integers of non-zero/0:$value = Boolean('true')      # true
$value = Boolean('Yes')       # true
$value = Boolean('FALSE')     # false
$value = Boolean('1')         # true
$value = Boolean(0)           # false
$value = Boolean(127)         # true



Converting data structures
Converting a hash to an array creates a multi-dimensional array by flattening each
                key-value pair into a two-element array as an element of another array. Converting
                an array to a hash interleaves alternating elements as keys and
                values.$an_array = Array({a => 10, b => 20}) # results in [[a, 10],[b, 20]]
$a_hash   = Hash([1,2,3,4])           # results in {1=>2, 3=>4}
$a_hash   = Hash([[1,2],[3,4]])       # results in {1=>2, 3=>4}The Array
                conversion also takes a second argument to "force" an array conversion. This
                slightly changes the semantics of the operation by creating a single-element array
                out of the first argument if it's not
                already.$an_array = Array(1, true)        # results in [1]
$an_array = Array([1], true)      # results in [1]
$an_array = Array(1)              # Raises a type error, cannot convert directly
$an_array = Array({1 => 2}, true) # results in [{1 => 2}]
$an_array = Array({1 => 2}}       # results in [[1, 2]]
