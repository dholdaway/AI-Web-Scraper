Use cases

      Detections not matching use cases 
      

Default detections that are often outdated and don't work as expected.
      


     Â Personalized, relevant detections

Threat hunting

      No time for threat hunting
      

No time to hunt for threats as there is pressing alert fatigue and security data chaos. 
      


     Â Proactive security measures
      

We proactively hunt for access and traffic anomalies, correlating hosts, risks, vulnerabilities, and threats in real-time.

Incident response

      Time-consuming, manual processes
      

Manually correlate and investigate alerts, wait hours or even days for large queries to complete, impeding critical incident investigation and response activities.
      


     Clear answers in minutes
      

We provide you with all the answers in minutes, not hours. Actionable context explaining threat severity and the where, what, and when of an attack is available to you promptly, allowing you to react to threats immediately.
      


   More details
       


Operational cost

      Massive capital investments
      

Massive capital investments (CAPEX) into hardware, software, and engineers are required. You have to deal with burdensome software administration, DevOps, and resource planning instead of focusing time and energy on your security.
      


     OPEX+SIEM-as-a-Service model
      

We ensure the OPEX model and SIEM as a Service approach with zero overhead, allowing you to focus effort on your business rather than managing complex DevOps or security information and event management teams.
      


More details
       


Correlation rules

      Only default correlation rules
      

The inability of teams to write new effective correlation rules increases the number of alerts and false positives, leading to alert fatigue, missed critical threats, burnout, and constant employee attrition. All that leads to breaches and lack of answers. 
      


     1000+ new detections
      

We select and deploy correlation rules depending on your use cases, using our growing database of 1000+ new detections. By doing so, we help you easily find even a needle in a haystack, reduce false positives, effectively deal with threats, and optimize the workload of your security team.
      


   More details
       


Situation awareness

      Postponed
      

Reliance on standard reports leads to the lack of actual situation awareness and poor security posture management.
      


     Real-time situation awareness
      

We offer full real-time situation awareness including risky employees, assets, threats, and vulnerabilities with clear monthly reports and dedicated account managers. All you need to meet compliance requirements and gain confidence.

    Frequently asked questions
  





        What is SIEM as a managed service?
      







         Managed SIEM-as-a-service is a more cost-effective alternative to in-house, on-prem installation, setup, and maintenance of a security information and event management solution. In this case, an organization delegates software deployment, fine-tuning, and ongoing support to a third-party provider. 
        

   By engaging SIEM managed service providers, organizations gain access to experienced personnel, save expensive internal resources, accelerate time-to-value, and avoid unnecessary staff training and professional development costs. 
        






        What does co managed SIEM mean?
      






A co managed SIEM solution means a collaboration between an organization and a managed provider. Such an approach combines and augments the strengths of both parties by allowing them to share the responsibility, experience, and knowledge. The client and the managed cloud SIEM provider can create a scalable and effective solution that maximizes security risk monitoring, threat detection, and response capabilities amid the ever-evolving threat landscape. 

      





       What does UnderDefense as a managed SIEM provider offer?
      






UnderDefense offers a full range of security services and cooperation models that easily adapt to your needs, goals, and budgets. We can cover the entire SIEM-as-a-service process, from software selection, installation, setup, and maintenance to 24/7 remote SOC team and custom reporting. Finally, we are a product-agnostic SIEM as-a-service provider, meaning that you can choose security tech, and weâ€™ll make it work better for your business. 
      





					How much do SIEM management services cost?
        







We offer several packages and SIEM as a service pricing options suitable for different business sizes and maturity levels. Contact us today for a detailed quote based on your specific needs and goals.  
        






       What data will you access and see in my environment as a SIEM managed security service provider?
      






We take into account clientâ€™s requirements, compliance controls, and other business specifics. Thatâ€™s why, as a managed SIEM monitoring services company, we leverage only telemetry and incident metadata. We donâ€™t have access to PII and other sensitive data unless the client requests it. 
      





      What solutions do managed SIEM providers recommend?
      






Most SIEM as a service providers require companies to buy and install a concrete tech stack to start using their offerings. UnderDefense is a vendor-agnostic SIEM monitoring service provider. We seamlessly integrate into your existing stack and help you make the most of your security investments in the short run.
