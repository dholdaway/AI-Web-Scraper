Develop types and providers with the Resource API

The recommended method to create custom types and providers
    is to use the Resource API, which is built on top of Puppet core.
    It is easier, faster, and safer than the old types and providers method.
To get started developing types and providers
      with the Resource API:


Download 
Puppet Development Kit
 (PDK) appropriate to your operating system and
          architecture.


Create a new module with PDK, or work with an
          existing PDK-enabled module. To create a new module,
            run pdk new module
            <MODULE_NAME> from the command line, specifying the name of the
          module. Respond to the dialog questions.


To add the puppet-resource_api gem and enable modern rspec-style
          mocking, open the .sync.yml file in your editor, and add the following content: 

# .sync.yml
---
Gemfile:
  optional:
    ':development':
      - gem: 'puppet-resource_api'
spec/spec_helper.rb:
  mock_with: ':rspec'



Apply these changes by running pdk update



To create the required files for a new type and provider
          in the module, run: pdk new
            provider <provider_name>

You will get the following
            response: $ pdk new provider foo
pdk (INFO): Creating '.../example/lib/puppet/type/foo.rb'from template.
pdk (INFO): Creating '.../example/lib/puppet/provider/foo/foo.rb' from template.
pdk (INFO): Creating '.../example/spec/unit/puppet/provider/foo/foo_spec.rb' from template.
$The
            three generated files are the type (resource definition), the provider (resource
            implementation), and the unit tests. The default template contains an example that
            demonstrates the basic workings of the Resource API. This allows the unit tests to run
            immediately after creating the provider, which looks like this:
            $ pdk test unit
[✔] Preparing to run the unit tests.
[✔] Running unit tests.  
Evaluated 4 tests in 0.012065973 seconds: 0 failures, 0 pending.
[✔] Cleaning up after running unit tests.
$





Writing the type and provider

Write a type to
    describe the resource and define its metadata, and a provider
    to gather information about the resource and implement changes.
Writing the type
The type contains the shape of your resources. The template provides the necessary name and ensure attributes. You
        can modify their description and the name's type to match your resource. Add more attributes
        as you need.   # lib/puppet/type/yum.rb
require 'puppet/resource_api'

Puppet::ResourceApi.register_type(
  name: 'yum',
  docs: <<-EOS,
      This type provides Puppet with the capabilities to manage ...
    EOS
  attributes: {
    ensure: {
      type:    'Enum[present, absent]',
      desc:    'Whether this apt key should be present or absent on the target system.',
      default: 'present',
    },
    name: {
      type:      'String',
      desc:      'The name of the resource you want to manage.',
      behaviour: :namevar,
    },
  },
)

The following keys are available for defining attributes: 


type: the Puppet 4 data
              type allowed in this attribute. You can use all data types matching Scalar and Data. 



desc: a string describing this attribute. This is used
              in creating the automated API docs with  puppet-strings. 



default: a default value used by the runtime
              environment; when the caller does not specify a value for this attribute. 



behaviour / behavior:
              how the attribute behaves. Available values include: 



namevar: marks an attribute as part of the primary
                  key or identity of the resource. A given set of namevar values must distinctively identify an instance. 



init_only: this attribute can only be set during
                  the creation of the resource. Its value is reported going forward, but trying to
                  change it later leads to an error. For example, the base image for a VM or the UID
                  of a user. 



read_only: values for this attribute are returned
                    by get(), but set() is not able to change them. Values for this should never be
                  specified in a manifest. For example, the checksum of a file, or the MAC address
                  of a network interface. 



parameter: values for this attributes are not
                  returned by get(). You can use this attribute to
                  influence how the provider behaves. For example, you can influence the managehome attribute when creating a
                  user. 






Writing the provider
The provider is the most important part of your new resource, as it reads and enforces
        state. When you generate a provider with the pdk new
          provider command, PDK generates a provider file
        like this generated yum.rb file
        require 'puppet/resource_api/simple_provider'

# Implementation for the yum type using the Resource API.
class Puppet::Provider::Yum::Yum < Puppet::ResourceApi::SimpleProvider
  def get(_context)
    [
      {
        name: 'foo',
        ensure: 'present',
      },
      {
        name: 'bar',
        ensure: 'present',
      },
    ]
  end

  def create(context, name, should)
    context.notice("Creating '#{name}' with #{should.inspect}")
  end

  def update(context, name, should)
    context.notice("Updating '#{name}' with #{should.inspect}")
  end

  def delete(context, name)
    context.notice("Deleting '#{name}'")
  end
end
                

The optional initialize method can be used to set
        up state that is available throughout the execution of the catalog. This is most often used
        for establishing a connection when talking to a service, such as when you are managing a
        database.
The get(context) method returns a list of hashes
        describing the resources that are on the target system. The basic example would return an
        empty list. For example, these resources could be returned from this:
        [
  {
    name: 'a',
    ensure: 'present',
  },
  {
    name: 'b',
    ensure: 'present',
  },
]

The create, update,
        and delete methods are called by the SimpleProvider base class to change the system as requested
        by the catalog. The name argument is the name of
        the resource that is being processed. should contains the attribute hash — in the same format as get returns — with the values in the catalog.
When adding Ruby code to a module, follow these guidelines: 

For small sized blocks of code, put the code in the provider.


For medium sized blocks of code, put the code into a separate file in lib/puppet_x/$forgeuser/$modulename.rb. puppet_x is optional, but it helps keep the file name unique
              and reduces the risk of a file overwriting code from an unknown dependency. 


For large sized blocks of code, put the code in a separate gem. 




Unit testing
The generated unit tests in spec/unit/puppet/provider/<PROVIDER_NAME>_spec.rb are evaluated when
        you run pdk test unit.
