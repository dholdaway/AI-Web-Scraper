This affects the mosquitto_sub and mosquitto_rr clients.CVE-2024-9388mediumThe Black Widgets For Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file.CVE-2024-8512criticalThe W3SPEEDSTER plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 7.26 via the 'script' parameter of the hookBeforeStartOptimization() function. This is due to the plugin passing user supplied input to eval(). This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to execute code on the server.CVE-2024-9632highA flaw was found in the X.org server. Due to improperly tracked allocation size in _XkbSetCompatMap, a local attacker may be able to trigger a buffer overflow condition via a specially crafted payload, leading to denial of service or local privilege escalation in distributions where the X.org server is run with root privileges.CVE-2024-50512mediumGeneration of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information vulnerability in Posti Posti Shipping allows Retrieve Embedded Sensitive Data.This issue affects Posti Shipping: from n/a through 3.10.2.CVE-2024-50511criticalUnrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type vulnerability in David DONISA WP donimedia carousel allows Upload a Web Shell to a Web Server.This issue affects WP donimedia carousel: from n/a through 1.0.1.CVE-2024-50510criticalUnrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type vulnerability in Web and Print Design AR For Woocommerce allows Upload a Web Shell to a Web Server.This issue affects AR For Woocommerce: from n/a through 6.2.CVE-2024-50509highImproper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') vulnerability in Chetan Khandla Woocommerce Product Design allows Path Traversal.This issue affects Woocommerce Product Design: from n/a through 1.0.0.CVE-2024-50508highImproper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') vulnerability in Chetan Khandla Woocommerce Product Design allows Path Traversal.This issue affects Woocommerce Product Design: from n/a through 1.0.0.Updated ›CVE-2024-9886mediumThe WP Baidu Map plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'baidu_map' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.CVE-2024-9885mediumThe Widget or Sidebar Shortcode plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'sidebar' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 0.6.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.CVE-2024-9884mediumThe T(-) Countdown plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'tminus' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.CVE-2024-9846highThe The Enable Shortcodes inside Widgets,Comments and Experts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.CVE-2024-9676mediumA vulnerability was found in Podman, Buildah, and CRI-O. A symlink traversal vulnerability in the containers/storage library can cause Podman, Buildah, and CRI-O to hang and result in a denial of service via OOM kill when running a malicious image using an automatically assigned user namespace (`--userns=auto` in Podman and Buildah). The containers/storage library will read /etc/passwd inside the container, but does not properly validate if that file is a symlink, which can be used to cause the library to read an arbitrary file on the host.CVE-2024-9675mediumA vulnerability was found in Buildah. Cache mounts do not properly validate that user-specified paths for the cache are within our cache directory, allowing a `RUN` instruction in a Container file to mount an arbitrary directory from the host (read/write) into the container as long as those files can be accessed by the user running Buildah.CVE-2024-9632highA flaw was found in the X.org server. Due to improperly tracked allocation size in _XkbSetCompatMap, a local attacker may be able to trigger a buffer overflow condition via a specially crafted payload, leading to denial of service or local privilege escalation in distributions where the X.org server is run with root privileges.CVE-2024-9388mediumThe Black Widgets For Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file.CVE-2024-8871mediumThe Pricing Tables WordPress Plugin – Easy Pricing Tables plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg without appropriate escaping on the URL in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.CVE-2024-8792mediumThe Subscribe to Comments plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg without appropriate escaping on the URL in all versions up to, and including, 2.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.Tenable.comCommunity & SupportDocumentationEducation© 2024 Tenable®, Inc.
