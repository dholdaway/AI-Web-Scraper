Regular expressions

A regular expression (sometimes shortened to “regex” or
    “regexp”) is a pattern that can match some set of strings, and optionally capture parts of those
    strings for further use.
You can use regular expression values
        with the =~ and !~ match operators, case statements and selectors, node definitions, and
        functions like regsubst for editing strings, or match for capturing and extracting substrings. Regular expressions
        act like any other value, and can be assigned to variables and used in function
        arguments.
Syntax
Regular expressions are written as patterns enclosed within forward slashes. Unlike in Ruby, you cannot specify options or encodings after the final
        slash, like /node
        .*/m.if $host =~ /^www(\d+)\./ {
  notify { "Welcome web server #$1": }
}Puppet uses 
Ruby’s standard regular expression
        implementation to match patterns. Other forms of regular expression quoting,
        like Ruby’s %r{^www(\d+)\.}, are not allowed. You cannot interpolate variables or
        expressions into regex values.
If you are matching against a string that contains newlines, use \A and
           \z instead of ^ and $, which match the
        beginning and end of a line. This is a common mistake that can cause your regexp to
        unintentionally match multiline text.
Some places in the language accept both real regex values and stringified regexes — that
        is, the same pattern quoted as a string instead of surrounded by slashes.

Regular expression options
Regular expresions in Puppet cannot have options or
        encodings appended after the final slash. However, you can turn options on or off for
        portions of the expression using the (?<ENABLED
          OPTION>:<SUBPATTERN>) and (?-<DISABLED OPTION>:<SUBPATTERN>) notation. The following
        example enables the i option while disabling
          the m and x options:$packages = $operatingsystem ? {
  /(?i-mx:ubuntu|debian)/        => 'apache2',
  /(?i-mx:centos|fedora|redhat)/ => 'httpd',
}The following options are available: 
i
Ignore case.
m
Treat a new line as a character matched by .

x
Ignore whitespace and comments in the pattern.



Regular expression capture variables
Within conditional statements and node
          definitions, substrings withing parentheses () in a
        regular expression are available as numbered variables inside the associated code section.
        The first is $1, the second is $2, and so on. The entire match is available as $0.
These are not normal variables, and have some special behaviors:

The values of the numbered variables do not persist outside the code block associated
              with the pattern that set them.


You can’t manually assign values to a variable with only digits in its name; they can
              only be set by pattern matching.


In nested conditionals, each conditional has its own set of values for the set of
              numbered variables. At the end of an interior statement, the numbered variables are
              reset to their previous values for the remainder of the outside statement. This causes
              conditional statements to act like local scopes, but only with regard to the numbered
              variables.






The Regexp data type

The data type of regular expressions
            is Regexp. By
            default, Regexp matches any regular expression value. If you are looking for a type
        that matches strings which match arbitrary regular expressions, see
        the Pattern type. You can use parameters to restrict which values Regexp matches.
Parameters
The full signature for Regexp is:Regexp[<SPECIFIC REGULAR EXPRESSION>]The
                parameter is optional.










Position
Parameter
Data type
Default value
Description




1
Specific regular expression
Regexp
none
If specified, this results in a data type that only matches
                                    one specific regular expression value. Specifying a parameter
                                    here doesn’t have a practical use.




Examples:
Regexp
Matches any regular expression.
Regexp[/<regex>/]
Matches the regular expression /<regex>/ only.


Regexp matches only literal regular expression
                values. Don't confuse it with the abstract Pattern data type, which uses a regular expression to match a
                limited set of String values.
