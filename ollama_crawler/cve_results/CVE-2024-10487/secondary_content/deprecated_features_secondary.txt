Deprecated features
The following features and configuration settings are deprecated and will be
removed in a future major release of Puppet Server.

certificate-status settings

Now

If the certificate-authority.certificate-status.authorization-required
setting is false, all requests that are successfully validated by SSL (if
applicable for the port settings on the server) are permitted to use the
Certificate Status
HTTP API endpoints.  This includes requests which do not provide an SSL
client certificate.
If the certificate-authority.certificate-status.authorization-required setting
is true or not specified and the puppet-admin.client-whitelist setting has
one or more entries, only the requests whose Common Name in the SSL client
certificate subject matches one of the client-whitelist entries are
permitted to use the certificate status HTTP API endpoints.
For any other configuration, requests are only permitted to access the
certificate status HTTP API endpoints if allowed per the rule definitions in
the trapperkeeper-authorization "auth.conf" file.  See the
puppetserver "auth.conf" page for more
information.
In a Future Major Release
The certificate-status settings will be ignored completely by Puppet Server.
Requests made to the certificate-status HTTP API will only be allowed per the
trapperkeeper-authorization "auth.conf" configuration.Detecting and Updating

Look at the certificate-status settings in your configuration.  If
authorization-required is set to false or client-whitelist has one or
more entries, these settings would be used to authorize access to the
certificate status HTTP API instead of trapperkeeper-authorization.
If authorization-required is set to true or is not specified and if
the client-whitelist was empty, you could just remove the
certificate-authority section from your configuration.  The only behavior
that would change in Puppet Server from doing this would be that a warning
message would no longer be written to the "puppetserver.log" file at startup.
If authorization-required is set to false, you would need to create
a corresponding rule in the trapperkeeper-authorization file which would
allow unauthenticated client access to the certificate status API.
For example:
authorization: {
    version: 1
    rules: [
            {
                match-request: {
                    path: "/certificate_status/"
                    type: path
                    method: [ get, put, delete ]
                }
                allow-unauthenticated: true
                sort-order: 200
                name: "certificate_status"
            },
            {
                match-request: {
                    path: "/certificate_statuses/"
                    type: path
                    method: get
                }
                allow-unauthenticated: true
                sort-order: 200
                name: "certificate_statuses"
            },
            ...
    ]
}
If authorization-required is set to true or not set but the
client-whitelist has one or more custom entries in it, you would need to
create a corresponding rule in the trapperkeeper-authorization "auth.conf"
file which would allow only specific clients access to the certificate status
API.
For example, the current certificate status configuration could have:
certificate-authority:
    certificate-status: {
        client-whitelist: [ admin1, admin2 ]
    }
}
Corresponding trapperkeeper-authorization rules could have:
authorization: {
    version: 1
    rules: [
            {
                match-request: {
                    path: "/certificate_status/"
                    type: path
                    method: [ get, put, delete ]
                }
                allow: [ admin1, admin2 ]
                sort-order: 200
                name: "certificate_status"
            },
            {
                match-request: {
                    path: "/certificate_statuses/"
                    type: path
                    method: get
                }
                allow: [ admin1, admin2 ]
                sort-order: 200
                name: "certificate_statuses"
            },
            ...
    ]
}
After adding the desired rules to the trapperkeeper-authorization "auth.conf"
file, remove the certificate-authority section from the "puppetserver.conf"
file and restart the puppetserver service.
Context

In previous Puppet Server releases, there was no unified mechanism for
controlling access to the various endpoints that Puppet Server hosts.  Puppet
Server used core Puppet "auth.conf" to authorize requests handled via Ruby
Puppet and custom client whitelists for the CA and Admin endpoints.  The
custom client whitelists do not provide granular enough control to meet some
use cases.
trapperkeeper-authorization unifies authorization configuration across all
of these endpoints into a single file and provides more granular control.

puppet-admin Settings

Now

If the puppet-admin.authorization-required setting is false, all requests
that are successfully validated by SSL (if applicable for the port settings
on the server) are permitted to use the puppet-admin HTTP API endpoints.
This includes requests which do not provide an SSL client certificate.
If the puppet-admin.authorization-required setting is true or not
specified and the puppet-admin.client-whitelist setting has one or more
entries, only the requests whose Common Name in the SSL client certificate
subject matches one of the client-whitelist entries are permitted to use
the puppet-admin HTTP API endpoints.
For any other configuration, requests are only permitted to access the
puppet-admin HTTP API endpoints if allowed per the rule definitions in the
trapperkeeper-authorization "auth.conf" file.  See the
puppetserver "auth.conf" page for more
information.
In a Future Major Release
The puppet-admin settings will be ignored completely by Puppet Server.
Requests made to the puppet-admin HTTP API will only be allowed per the
trapperkeeper-authorization "auth.conf" configuration.Detecting and Updating

Look at the puppet-admin settings in your configuration.  If
authorization-required is set to false or client-whitelist has one or
more entries, these settings would be used to authorize access to the
puppet-admin HTTP API instead of trapperkeeper-authorization.
If authorization-required is set to true or is not specified and if
the client-whitelist was empty, you could just remove the puppet-admin
section from your configuration and restart your puppetserver service in order
for Puppet Server to start using the trapperkeeper-authorization "auth.conf"
file.  The only behavior that would change in Puppet Server from doing this
would be that a warning message would no longer be written to the
puppetserver.log file.
If authorization-required is set to false, you would need to create
corresponding rules in the trapperkeeper-authorization file which would
allow unauthenticated client access to the "puppet-admin" API endpoints.
For example:
authorization: {
    version: 1
    rules: [
            {
                match-request: {
                    path: "/puppet-admin-api/v1/environment-cache"
                    type: path
                    method: delete
                }
                allow-unauthenticated: true
                sort-order: 200
                name: "environment-cache"
            },
            {
                match-request: {
                    path: "/puppet-admin-api/v1/jruby-pool"
                    type: path
                    method: delete
                }
                allow-unauthenticated: true
                sort-order: 200
                name: "jruby-pool"
            },
            ...
     ]
}
If authorization-required is set to true or not set but the
client-whitelist has one or more custom entries in it, you would need to
create corresponding rules in the trapperkeeper-authorization "auth.conf"
file which would allow only specific clients access to the "puppet-admin"
API endpoints.
For example, the current "puppet-admin" configuration could have:
puppet-admin: {
    client-whitelist: [ admin1, admin2 ]
}
Corresponding trapperkeeper-authorization rules could have:
authorization: {
    version: 1
    rules: [
            {
                match-request: {
                    path: "/puppet-admin-api/v1/environment-cache"
                    type: path
                    method: delete
                }
                allow: [ admin1, admin2 ]
                sort-order: 200
                name: "environment-cache"
            },
            {
                match-request: {
                    path: "/puppet-admin-api/v1/jruby-pool"
                    type: path
                    method: delete
                }
                allow: [ admin1, admin2 ]
                sort-order: 200
                name: "jruby-pool"
            },
            ...
     ]
}
After adding the desired rules to the trapperkeeper-authorization "auth.conf"
file, remove the puppet-admin section from the "puppetserver.conf" file
and restart the puppetserver service.
Context

In previous Puppet Server releases, there was no unified mechanism for
controlling access to the various endpoints that Puppet Server hosts.  Puppet
Server used core Puppet "auth.conf" to authorize requests handled by Ruby
Puppet and custom client whitelists for the CA and Admin endpoints.  The
custom client allowlists do not provide granular enough control to meet some
use cases.
trapperkeeper-authorization unifies authorization configuration across all
of these endpoints into a single file and provides more granular control.
Puppet's "resource_types" API endpoint

Now
The resource_type and resource_types HTTP APIs were removed in Puppet Server 5.0.Previously

The resource_type and resource_types Puppet HTTP API endpoints return information about classes, defined types, and node definitions.
The environment_classes HTTP API in Puppet Server serves as a replacement for the Puppet resource type API for classes.
Detecting and Updating

If your application calls the resource_type or resource_types HTTP API endpoints for information about classes, point those calls to the environment_classes endpoint. The environment_classes endpoint has different features and returns different values than resource_type; see the changes in the environment classes API for details.
The environment_classes endpoint ignores Puppet's Ruby-based authorization methods and configuration in favor of Puppet Server's Trapperkeeper authorization. For more information, see the "Authorization" section of the environment classes API documentation.
Context

Users often rely on the resource_types endpoint for lists of classes and associated parameters in an environment. For such requests, the resource_types endpoint is inefficient and can trigger problematic events, such as manifests being parsed during a catalog request.
To fulfill these requests more efficiently and safely, Puppet Server 2.3.0 introduced the narrowly defined environment_classes endpoint.
Puppet's node cache terminus

Now
Puppet 5.0 (and by extension, Puppet Server 5.0) no longer writes node YAML files to its cache by default.Previously
Puppet wrote YAML to its node cache.Detecting and Updating
To retain the Puppet 4.x behavior, add the puppet.conf setting node_cache_terminus = write_only_yaml. The write_only_yaml option is deprecated.Context
This cache was used in workflows where external tooling needs a list of nodes. PuppetDB is the preferred source of node information.JRuby's "compat-version" setting

Now
Puppet Server 5.0 removes the jruby-puppet.compat-version setting in puppetserver.conf, and exits the puppetserver service with an error if you start the service with that setting.Previously
Puppet Server 2.7.x allowed you to set compat-version to 1.9 or 2.0 to choose a preferred Ruby interpreter version.Detecting and Updating

Launching the puppetserver service with this setting enabled will cause it to exit with an error message. The error includes information on switching from JRuby 1.7.x to JRuby 9k.
For Ruby language 2.x support in Puppet Server, configure Puppet Server to use JRuby 9k instead of JRuby 1.7.27. See the "Configuring the JRuby Version" section of Puppet Server Configuration for details.
Context

Puppet Server 5.0 updated JRuby v1.7 to v1.7.27, which in turn updated the jruby-openssl gem to v0.9.19 and bouncycastle libraries to v1.55. JRuby 1.7.27 breaks setting jruby-puppet.compat-version to 2.0.
Server 5.0 also added optional, experimental support for JRuby 9k, which includes Ruby 2.x language support.
