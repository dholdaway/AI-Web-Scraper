Resource types

Resource types are a special family of data
    types that behave differently from other data types. They are subtypes of the fairly
      abstract Resource data
    type. Resource references are a useful subset of this data type family.
In the Puppet language, there are never any values whose data
        type is one of these resource types. That is, you can never create an expression
          where $my_value =~
          Resource evaluates to true. For example, a resource declaration — an expression
        whose value you might expect would be a resource — executes a side effect and then produces
          a resource
          reference as its value. A resource reference is a data type in this family of
        data types, rather than a value that has one of these data types.
In almost all situations, if one of these resource type data types is involved, it
        makes more sense to treat it as a special language keyword than to treat it as part of a
        hierarchy of data types. It does have a place in that hierarchy; it’s just complicated, and
        you don’t need to know it to do things in the Puppet
        language.
For that reason, the information on this page is provided
        for the sake of technical completeness, but learning it isn't critical to your ability to
        use Puppet successfully.
Basics
Puppet automatically creates new known data type values for every resource
        type it knows about, including custom resource types and defined types.
These one-off data types share the name of the resource type they correspond to, with the
        first letter of every namespace segment capitalized. For example, the file type creates a data type called File.
Additionally, there is a parent Resource data
        type. All of these one-off data types are more-specific subtypes of Resource.

Usage of resource types without a title
A resource data type can be used in the following places: 

The resource type slot of a resource declaration.


The resource type slot of a resource default statement.



For
        example:# A resource declaration using a resource data type:
File { "/etc/ntp.conf":
  mode  => "0644",
  owner => "root",
  group => "root",
}

# Equivalent to the above:
Resource["file"] { "/etc/ntp.conf":
  mode  => "0644",
  owner => "root",
  group => "root",
}

# A resource default:
File {
  mode  => "0644",
  owner => "root",
  group => "root",
}


Usage of resource types with a title
If a resource data type includes a title, it acts as a resource reference, which are
        useful in several places. For more information, see Resource and class references.



The <SOME ARBITRARY RESOURCE TYPE> data
        type

For each resource type mytype known to Puppet, there is a data type, Mytype. It matches no values
        that can be produced in the Puppet language. You can use
        parameters to restrict which values Mytype matches, but it still matches no values.
Parameters
The full signature for a resource-type-corresponding data type Mytype is:Mytype[<RESOURCE TITLE>]This
                parameter is optional.










Position
Parameter
Data type
Default value
Description




1
Resource title
String
nothing
The title of some specific resource of this type. If
                                    provided, this turns this data type into a usable resource
                                        reference.




Examples:
File
The data type corresponding to the file resource type.
File['/tmp/filename.ext']
A resource reference to the file resource whose title is /tmp/filename.ext.
Type[File]
The data type that matches any resource
                                references to file resources. This is useful for, for example,
                            restricting the values of class or defined type parameters.





The Resource data type

There is also a general Resource data type, which all <SOME ARBITRARY RESOURCE
            TYPE> data types are more-specific subtypes of. Like the Mytype-style data types, it
        matches no values that can be produced in the Puppet language. You can use
        parameters to restrict which values Resource matches, but it still matches no
        values.
This is useful in the following
                uncommon circumstances:
You need to interact with a
                            resource type before you know its name. For example, you can do some
                            clever business with the iteration functions to re-implement the create_resources function in the Puppet language, where your lambda
                            receives arguments telling it to create resources of some resource type
                            at runtime.
Someone has somehow created a
                            resource type whose name is invalid in the Puppet language, possibly by conflicting
                            with a reserved word — you can use a Resource value to refer to
                            that resource type in resource declarations and resource default
                            statements, and to create resource references.


Parameters
The full signature for Resource is:Resource[<RESOURCE TYPE>, <RESOURCE TITLE>...]All
                of these parameters are optional. They must be listed in order; if you need to
                specify a later parameter, you must specify values for any prior ones.










Position
Parameter
Data type
Default value
Description




1
Resource type

String or Resource

nothing
A resource type, either as a string or a Resource data type value. If
                                    provided, this turns this data type into a resource-specific
                                    data type. Resource[Mytype]
                                        and Resource["mytype"] are identical to the data
                                        type Mytype.


2 and higher
Resource title
String
nothing
The title of some specific resource of this type. If
                                    provided, this turns this data type into a usable resource
                                        reference or array of resource
                                        references. Resource[Mytype,
                                        "mytitle"] and Resource["mytype", "mytitle"] are identical
                                    to the data type Mytype["mytitle"].




Examples:
Resource[File]
The data type corresponding to the file resource type.
Resource[File, '/tmp/filename.ext']
A resource reference to the file resource whose title is /tmp/filename.ext.
Resource["file",
                            '/tmp/filename.ext']
A resource reference to the file resource whose title is /tmp/filename.ext.
Resource[File, '/tmp/filename.ext',
                                '/tmp/bar']
Equivalent to [ File['/tmp/filename.ext'],
                                File['/tmp/bar'] ].
Type[Resource[File]]
A synonym for the data type that matches any resource
                            references to file resources.
                            This is useful for, for example, restricting the values of class or
                            defined type parameters.
Type[Resource["file"]]
Another synonym for the data type
                            that matches any resource references to file resources. This is useful for, for
                            example, restricting the values of class or defined type
                            parameters.





The Class data type

The Class data type is roughly equivalent to the set
            of Mytype data
        types, except it is for classes. Like the Mytype-style data types, it matches no values that can
        be produced in the Puppet language. You can use parameters to
        restrict which values Class matches, but it will matches no values.
Parameters
The full signature
                for Class is:Class[<CLASS NAME>]This
                parameter is optional.










Position
Parameter
Data type
Default value
Description




1
Class name
String
nothing
The name of a class. If provided, this turns this data type
                                    into a usable class
                                        reference.




Examples:
Class["apache"]
A class
                                reference to class apache.
Type[Class]
The data type that matches any class references.
                            This is useful for, for example, restricting the values of class or
                            defined type parameters.





Related data types
The abstract Catalogentry data type is the supertype of Resource and Class. You can use Type[Catalogentry] as the
        data type for a class or defined type parameter that can accept both class references and
        resource references.
