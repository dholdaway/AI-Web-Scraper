Initial Access Intelligence












The "Initial Access Intelligence" module is a vital tool for cybersecurity, designed to scan GitHub
                repositories for the latest exploit and proof-of-concept codes for new vulnerabilities. It provides
                users with crucial updates on potential security threats, enabling proactive defense measures. This
                module helps close the gap between vulnerability discovery and patching, significantly enhancing system
                security.
