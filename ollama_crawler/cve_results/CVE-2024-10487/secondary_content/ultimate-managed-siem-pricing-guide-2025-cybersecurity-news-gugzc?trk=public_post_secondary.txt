SIEM is more than a piece of technology—it’s the cornerstone of your business’s security. But setting it up and keeping it running smoothly is a real hurdle, even with a SOC team in place. It’s not a rarity when log data piles up and default rules won’t do the job. Your team can easily get swamped by alerts, which could lead to compliance issues or missed threats.Challenges of 2025Meet Mike, a CTO of a fast-growing SaaS company. It’s Q4 2024, and like many CTOs, Mike is deep into planning next year’s budget. With regulators tightening the reins on data protection and the alarming rise in AI-powered cyberattacks, Mike knows it’s time to level up his security game. As he looks toward 2025, a few major challenges keep popping up:24/7 log monitoring to meet compliance standards like SOC 2, ISO 27001, etcIntegrating and normalizing telemetry from all kinds of sources—cloud, on-prem systems, network devices—just to get a clear security viewReducing detection and response times for security threatsBalancing advanced SIEM capabilities with a tight IT budgetMike knows he needs Managed SIEM services to solve these problems, but like many, he's worried it might be too costly or finds the pricing confusing. Sound familiar? Many executives are grappling with the same issue: securing their business for 2025 without blowing the budget.Solution? Flexible Managed SIEM optionsTo address these challenges, Mike is considering a Managed SIEM solution:SIEM Professional Services can help organizations better monitor, detect, and respond to cyber threats. It usually involves reviewing your SIEM setup, optimizing its performance, and building custom detection rules—because, let’s face it, the out-of-the-box settings just aren’t enough for most environments.For teams that want to stay hands-on but need extra support, Co-managed SIEM strikes a great balance. You stay in control of the critical stuff while SOC experts handle 24/7 monitoring, incident management, and compliance reporting. It’s the best of both worlds: your team stays engaged, but the day-to-day heavy lifting does not bog you down.If you’d rather hand off the whole thing, SIEM-as-a-Service (Managed SIEM) might be the answer. It covers everything from setup to ongoing monitoring and threat response using top-tier cloud SIEMs. This option is perfect if you want top-notch security without managing it yourself.Each option is tailored to meet different needs and constraints, ensuring you get the right level of support and expertise to keep your security tight.As for Mike, he wanted to keep his team in the loop, so he went with Co-managed SIEM. It’s a perfect balance—his team controls the critical elements, while external SOC experts handle 24/7 monitoring, incident management, and compliance reporting. Plus, his team learns from the experts, boosting their skills. Mike gets enhanced security without losing control, and a smarter, more capable team.Expert tips for choosing your Managed SIEM providerWhen selecting a Managed SIEM provider, consider the following:Define your specific security and compliance requirementsAssess the provider's capabilities, technology, and security expertiseReview their compliance support and deployment optionsCompare pricing models and contract termsEvaluate their support levels and Service Level Agreements (SLAs)Request references and demos to validate their effectivenessConsider the potential for a long-term partnership as your needs evolveNavigate SIEM pricing with confidenceTo help you make an informed decision, we've created the comprehensive Managed SIEM Pricing Guide.
