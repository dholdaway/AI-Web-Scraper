                The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is a repository of standards based vulnerability data. 
                The Database is maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency 
                of the Federal Government, and is being provided as a public service. Much of the data in NVD 
                records is derived from publicly available data sources, including product information and 
                manufacturer/developer information. NIST does not evaluate, review, or test software or code 
                contained within the NVD. 
                The NVD is expressly provided “AS IS.” NIST MAKES NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, 
                INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, 
                NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND DATA ACCURACY. NIST does not warrant or make any representations regarding the use 
                of the NVD, its contents, or the results obtained therefrom, including but not limited to the correctness, 
                accuracy, reliability, or usefulness of the NVD. 
                You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of your use of the NVD and its contents and 
                you assume all risks associated with its use.
