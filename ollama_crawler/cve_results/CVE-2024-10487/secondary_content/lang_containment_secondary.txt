Containment

Containment is what controls the order in which the various parts of your
      Puppet code are executed. Containment is the relationship that
    resources have to classes and defined types, determining what has to happen before other things
    can happen.
Classes and defined type instances contain the resources they declare. Contained
        resources are not applied before the container begins, and they finish before the container
        finishes.
This means that if any resource or class forms a relationship with the container, it forms the same relationship with every
        resource inside the container.
Consider this
        example:class ntp {
  file { '/etc/ntp.conf':
    ...
    require => Package['ntp'],
    notify  => Service['ntp'],
  }
  service { 'ntp':
    ...
  }
  package { 'ntp':
    ...
  }
}

include ntp
exec {'/usr/local/bin/update_custom_timestamps.sh':
  require => Class['ntp'],
}Here,
          exec['/usr/local/bin/update_custom_timestamps.sh'] would
        happen after every resource in the ntp class, including the
        package, file, and service.
Containment allows you to notify and subscribe to
        classes and defined resource types as though they were a single resource.
Containment of resources
Resources of both native and defined resource types are automatically contained by the
        class or defined type in which they are declared.



Containment of classes

Unlike with resources, Puppet does not automatically
    contain classes when they are declared inside another class (by using the
      include function or resource-like declaration). But in certain situations,
    having classes contain other classes can be useful, especially in larger modules where you want
    to improve code readability by moving chunks of implementation into separate files.
You can declare a class in any number of places in the code, allowing classes to
      announce their needs without worrying about whether other code also needs the same
      classes at the same time. Puppet includes the declared class only one time, regardless of how
      many times it's declared (that is, the include function is idempotent). Usually, this is fine, and code shouldn't attempt to strictly contain
      the class. However, there are ways to explicitly set more strict containment relationships of
      contained classes when it is called for. 
When you're deciding whether to set up explicit containment relationships for declared
      classes, follow these guidelines:

include: When you need to declare a class and nothing in it is
          required for the enforcement of the current class you're working on, use the
            include function. It ensures that the named class is included. It sets
          no ordering relationships. Use include as your default choice for
          declaring classes. Use the other functions only if they meet specific criteria.

require: When resources from another class should be enforced
          before the current class you're working on can be enforced properly, use the
            require function to declare classes. It ensures that the named class is
          included. It sets relationships so that everything in the named class is enforced before
          the current class.

contain: When you are writing a class in which users should be
          able to set relationships, use the contain function to declare classes.
          It ensures that the named class is included. It sets relationships so that any
          relationships specified on the current class also apply to the class you're
          containing.


The require function
The require function is useful when the class you're writing needs another
        class to be successfully enforced before it can be enforced properly. 
For example, suppose you're writing classes to install two apps, both of which are
        distributed by the Chocolatey package manager, for which you've created a class called
          chocolatey. Both classes require that Chocolatey be properly managed
        before they can each proceed. Instead of using include, which won't ensure
        Chocolatey's resources are managed before it installs each app, use
        require.class myapp::install {
  # works just like include, but also creates a relationship
  # Class['chocolatey'] -> Class['myapp::install']
  require chocolatey
  package { 'myapp':
    ensure => present,
  }
}

class my_other_app::install {
  require chocolatey
  package { 'my_other_app':
    ensure => present,
  }
}



The contain function
Use the contain function to declare that a class is
        contained. This is useful for when you're writing a class in which other users should be
        able to express relationships. Any classes contained in your class will have containment
        relationships with any other classes that declare your class. The contain function uses include-like behavior, containing a class within a
        surrounding class.
For example, suppose you have three classes that an app package
          (myapp::install), creating its configuration file
          (myapp::config), and managing its service
          (myapp::service). Using the contain function explicitly
        tells Puppet that the internal classes should be contained
        within the class that declares them. The contain function works like
          include, but also adds class relationships that ensure that relationships
        made on the parent class also propagate inside, just like they do with
        resources.class myapp {
  # Using the contain function ensures that relationships on myapp also apply to these classes
  contain myapp::install
  contain myapp::config
  contain myapp::service
  
  Class['myapp::install'] -> Class['myapp::config'] ~> Class['myapp::service']
}Although it may be tempting to use contain everywhere, it's
        better to use include unless there's an explicit reason why it won't
        work.
