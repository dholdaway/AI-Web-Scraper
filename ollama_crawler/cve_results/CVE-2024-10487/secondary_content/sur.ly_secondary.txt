Surely the simplest tool to:






Cope with fake users signing up for your site to get backlinks

Minimize the risk of an algorithmic Google penalty

Sur.ly turns any risky or toxic outbound links within user-generated content into safe and SEO-friendly internal links.






Keep users within your domain longer to reduce the bounce rate

Sur.ly allows users to view the external pages while staying within your domain as long as possible and thus helps you keep the bounce rate in check.






Recapture users leaving via outbound links

Sur.ly helps you to attract users back to your site with the headlines and pics from your articles listed on a clickable panel at the top of every external page.






Protect users after they follow the outbound links

Sur.ly provides users with a toolbar showing an up-to-date safety status of every website they visit via your links and warns about detected threats.






Keep your traffic data private and secure

Confidentiality is the key to success. With Sur.ly you can keep all the external traffic stats to yourself by relying upon your subdomain as a safety buffer.

Without Sur.ly

Visitors can leave a site quickly via the outbound links and never return.

Cases


User voice:

“Spambots create fake albums on our photo sharing platform to get free backlinks...”
Sur.ly is a perfect solution to prevent passing a vote of recommendation (so called link juice) from your project to some shady external sites via outbound links added by spammers. Sur.ly can turn such outbound links into internal links leading to your safe subdomain - in such a way no link juice is flowed to external sites (except for the whitelisted friendly domains) and spammers cannot benefit from it anymore.In other words, Sur.ly helps web projects to avoid unsolicited links to irrelevant or low-quality sites, especially posted within user-generated content, and thus stay reputed and loveable in the eyes of almighty Google, with a lesser risk of an algorithmic penalty or other negative outcome.



User voice:

“Users exit our classified ads portal once they find a service they needed and follow its link, but we would like them to return and stay longer...”
Sur.ly provides a few effective options to recapture visitors and keep them on your site longer to decrease the bounce rate. When a visitor clicks a link (replaced by Sur.ly) and opens an external target page, he or she still stays within your domain technically, while being able to seamlessly browse another website.Those third-party sites still can receive and appreciate the referral traffic coming from your pages as usual. At the same time, Sur.ly provides a toolbar that accompanies users all the time while they browse the external sources - it displays your website’s latest headlines, text snippets and pics, and thus prompts visitors to return for more interesting stuff.



User voice:

“Our forum was penalized by Google because some user-generated links suddenly turned toxic, as the target page got hijacked and became unsafe...”
With the help of Sur.ly it’s much easier to keep a site safe and reputable, especially if it contains a lot of user-generated content - comments, forum posts, shared links, etc. Sur.ly can beat all the risks coming from risky or unattended outbound links within a user-contributed content, so neither of those links can suddenly turn into a SEO nightmare.Even if a link becomes unsafe, Sur.ly will prevent spreading its toxic impact upon the whole site. Moreover, visitors will also stay safe, as Sur.ly detects any threat or unsafe content (adult, malware, etc) and prevents users from reaching it without a warning and making a conscious choice.
