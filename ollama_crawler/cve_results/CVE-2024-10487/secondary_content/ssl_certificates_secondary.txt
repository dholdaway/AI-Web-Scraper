Certificate authority and SSL


Puppet can use its built-in certificate authority (CA) and
        public key infrastructure (PKI) tools or use an existing external CA for all of its secure
        socket layer (SSL) communications. 

Puppet uses certificates to verify the the identity of
            nodes. These certificates are issued by the certificate authority (CA) service of a Puppet primary server. When a node checks into the Puppet v for the first time, it requests a
            certificate. The Puppet primary server examines this request, and
            if it seems safe, creates a certificate for the node. When the agent node picks up this
            certificate, it knows it can trust the Puppet primary server, and
            it can now identify itself later when requesting a catalog.
After installing the Puppet Server, before
            starting it for the first time, use the puppetserver ca setup command to create a default
            intermediate CA. For more complex use cases, see the Intermediate and External CA
            documentation.


Note: For backward compatibility, starting Puppet Server before running puppetserver ca setup creates the old
                single-cert CA. This configuration is not recommended, so if you are using Puppet 6, use the setup command instead.


Puppet provides two command line tools for performing SSL
            tasks: 



puppetserver
                            ca
 signs certificate requests and revokes certificates.


puppet
                            ssl
 performs agent-side tasks, such as submitting a certificate request or
                    downloading a node certificate. 

What's changed in Puppet 6

Puppet 6 removes the puppet
                    cert command and its associated certificate-related faces. In Puppet 6 you must use the new subcommands listed
                above instead.

Puppet 6 also introduces full support for intermediate CAs, the recommended architecture. This
                requires changes on both the server and the agent, so using it requires both the
                server and the agent to be updated to Puppet 6.




Puppet Server CA commands Puppet Server has a puppetserver ca     command that performs certificate authority (CA) tasks like signing and revoking certificates.     Most of its actions are performed by making HTTP requests to Puppet Server’s CA API, specifically the certificate_status endpoint. You must have Puppet Server     running in order to sign or revoke certificates.

Intermediate CA


Autosigning certificate requestsBefore Puppet agent nodes         can retrieve their configuration catalogs, they require a signed certificate from the local             Puppet certificate authority (CA). When using Puppet’s built-in CA instead of an external CA, agents submit         a certificate signing request (CSR) to the CA to retrieve a signed certificate after it's         available.

CSR attributes and certificate extensionsWhen Puppet agent nodes         request their certificates, the certificate signing request (CSR) usually contains only         their certname and the necessary cryptographic information. Agents can also embed additional         data in their CSR, useful for policy-based autosigning and for adding new trusted         facts.

Regenerating certificates in a Puppet deploymentIn some cases, you might need to regenerate the         certificates and security credentials (private and public keys) that are generated by Puppet’s built-in PKI systems.

External CAThis information describes the supported and tested         configurations for external CAs in this version of Puppet. If         you have an external CA use case that isn’t listed here, contact Puppet so we can learn more about it.
