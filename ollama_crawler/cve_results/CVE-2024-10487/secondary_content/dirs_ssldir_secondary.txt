SSL directory (ssldir)


Puppet stores its certificate infrastructure in
    the SSL directory (ssldir) which has a similar structure on all Puppet nodes, whether they are agent nodes, primary Puppet servers, or the certificate authority (CA)
    server.
Location
By default, the ssldir is a subdirectory of the confdir. 
You can change its location using the ssldir setting
        in the puppet.conf file. See the Configuration reference for more
        information. 
Note: The content of the ssldir is generated, grows over time, and
          is relatively difficult to replace. Some third-party Puppet
          packages for Linux place the ssldir in the cache directory
            (vardir) instead of the confdir. When a
          distro changes the ssldir location, it sets ssldir in the $confdir/puppet.conf file, usually in the [main] section. 

To see the location of the ssldir on one of your nodes, run: puppet
          config print ssldir


Contents
The ssldir contains Puppet certificates, private
        keys, certificate signing requests (CSRs), and other cryptographic documents. 
The ssldir on an agent or primary server contains: 

A private key: private_keys/<certname>.pem



A signed certificate: certs/<certname>.pem



A copy of the CA certificate: certs/ca.pem



A copy of the certificate revocation list (CRL): crl.pem



A copy of its sent CSR: certificate_requests/<certname>.pem





Tip:  Puppet does not save its public key to disk, because the public key is
        derivable from its private key and is contained in its certificate. If you need to extract
        the public key, use $ openssl rsa -in $(puppet config print hostprivkey)
          -pubout

 If these files don’t exist on a node, it's because they are generated locally or requested
        from the CA server.
Agent and primary server credentials are identified by certname, so an agent process and a primary server process running on the same
        server can use the same credentials.
The ssldir for the Puppet CA, which runs on the CA
        server, contains similar credentials: private and public keys, a certificate, and a primary
        server copy of the CRL. It maintains a list of all signed certificates in the deployment, a
        copy of each signed certificate, and an incrementing serial number for new certificates. To
        keep it separated from general Puppet credentials on the same
        server, all of the CA’s data is stored in the ca subdirectory.

The ssldir directory structure
All of the files and directories in the ssldir directory have corresponding Puppet
        settings, which can be used to change their locations. Generally, though, don't change the
        default values unless you have a specific problem to work around.
Ensure the permissions mode of the ssldir is 0771. The directory and each file in
        it is owned by the user that Puppet runs as: root or
        Administrator on agents, and defaulting to puppet or pe-puppet on a primary
        server. Set up automated management for ownership and permissions on the ssldir.
The ssldir has the following structure. See the Configuration reference for details about each puppet.conf setting listed: 

ca directory (on the CA server only): Contains the files
            used by Puppet’s certificate authority. Mode: 0755.
            Setting: cadir. 

ca_crl.pem: The primary server copy of the
                certificate revocation list (CRL) managed by the CA. Mode: 0644.
                  Setting: cacrl. 

ca_crt.pem: The CA’s self-signed certificate. This
                cannot be used as a primary server or agent certificate; it can only be used to sign
                certificates. Mode: 0644. Setting: cacert. 

ca_key.pem: The CA’s private key, and one of the
                most security-critical files in the Puppet
                certificate infrastructure. Mode: 0640. Setting: cakey. 

ca_pub.pem: The CA’s public key. Mode: 0644.
                  Setting: capub. 

inventory.txt: A list of the certificates the CA
                signed, along with their serial numbers and validity periods. Mode: 0644.
                  Setting: cert_inventory. 

requests (directory): Contains the certificate
                signing requests (CSRs) that have been received but not yet signed. The CA deletes
                CSRs from this directory after signing them. Mode: 0755. Setting: csrdir. 

<name>.pem: CSR files awaiting signing.
                  



serial: A file containing the serial number for the
                next certificate the CA signs. This is incremented with each new certificate signed.
                Mode: 0644. Setting: serial. 

signed (directory): Contains copies of all
                certificates the CA has signed. Mode: 0755. Setting: signeddir. 

<name>.pem: Signed certificate files.
                  





certificate_requests (directory): Contains CSRs
            generated by this node in preparation for submission to the CA. CSRs stay in this
            directory even after they have been submitted and signed. Mode: 0755.
              Setting: requestdir. 

<certname>.pem: This node’s CSR. Mode: 0644.
                  Setting: hostcsr. 



certs (directory): Contains signed certificates present
            on the node. This includes the node’s own certificate, and a copy of the CA certificate
            for validating certificates presented by other nodes. Mode: 0755. Setting: certdir. 

<certname>.pem: This node’s certificate. Mode:
                0644. Setting: hostcert. 

ca.pem: A local copy of the CA certificate. Mode:
                0644. Setting: localcacert. 



crl.pem: A copy of the certificate revocation list (CRL)
            retrieved from the CA, for use by agents or primary servers. Mode: 0644.
              Setting: hostcrl. 

private (directory): Usually, does not contain any
            files. Mode: 0750. Setting: privatedir. 

password: The password to a node’s private key.
                Usually not present. The conditions in which this file would exist are not defined.
                Mode: 0640. Setting: passfile. 



private_keys (directory): Contains the node's private
            key and, on the CA, private keys created by the puppetserver ca
              generate command. It never contains the private key for the CA certificate.
            Mode: 0750. Setting: privatekeydir. 

<certname>.pem: This node’s private key. Mode:
                0600. Setting: hostprivkey. 



public_keys (directory): Contains public keys generated
            by this node in preparation for generating a CSR. Mode: 0755. Setting: publickeydir. 

<certname>.pem: This node’s public key. Mode:
                0644. Setting: hostpubkey.
