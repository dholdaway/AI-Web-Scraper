Using Puppet code

Define the desired state of your infrastructure using Puppet code. 

Puppet code is stored in modules. If you are new to
                Puppet or want to save time, use the pre-built and tested modules on the Puppet
                    Forge — a repository of thousands of modules made by Puppet developers and the Puppet community. 
Modules manage specific tasks in your infrastructure, such as installing
                and configuring a piece of software. Modules contain both code and data. The data is
                what allows you to customize your configuration. Using a tool called Hiera, you can separate the data from the code and
                place it in a centralized location. This allows you to specify guardrails and define
                known parameters and variations, so that your code is fully testable and you can
                validate all the edge cases of your parameters.
If you are an advanced user and want to write your own Puppet code, refer to the
                Puppet language and modules documentation. 




Classifying nodesYou can classify nodes using an external node classifier (ENC), which is a script or         application that tells Puppet which classes a node must have.         It can replace or work in concert with the node definitions in the main site manifest             (site.pp).

Managing environment content with a PuppetfileA Puppetfile specifies detailed information about each         environment's Puppet code and data.

Using content from Puppet ForgePuppet Forge is a collection of modules and how-to guides developed by             Puppet and its community. 

Designing system configs (roles and profiles)Your typical goal with Puppet is to build complete system configurations, which manage all of the software, services,         and configuration that you care about on a given system. The roles and profiles method can         help keep complexity under control and make your code more reusable, reconfigurable, and         refactorable.

Separating data (Hiera) Hiera is a built-in key-value configuration data lookup         system, used for separating data from Puppet code. 

Use case examplesTry out some common configuration tasks to see how you can use Puppet to manage your IT infrastructure.
