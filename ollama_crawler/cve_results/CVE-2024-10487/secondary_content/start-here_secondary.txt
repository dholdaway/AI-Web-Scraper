Getting Started
		
				All NIST publications are available in the public domain according to Title 17 of 
				the United States Code, however services which utilize or access the NVD are asked 
				to display the following notice prominently within the application: "This product 
				uses data from the NVD API but is not endorsed or certified by the NVD." You may 
				use the NVD name to identify the source of the data. You may not use the 
				NVD name, to imply endorsement of any product, service, or entity, not-for-profit, 
				commercial or otherwise. For information on how to the cite the NVD, including the 
				database's Digital Object Identifier (DOI), please consult 
				NIST's Public Data Repository.
			

				This documentation assumes that you already understand at least one common programming 
				language and are generally familiar with JSON RESTful services. JSON specifies the 
				format of the data returned by the REST service. REST refers to a style of services 
				that allow computers to communicate via HTTP over the Internet.  
			

				All requests to the APIs use the HTTP GET method and each API has a unique base URL.  
				Parameters may be added to the URL query to filter requests for specific information.  
				The parameters function similar to those found on the NVD’s advanced CVE search page and 
				the CVE/CPE details pages. All parameter names and values are case insensitive.     
			

				API keys are passed in the request header.  The exact method of passing header information with a GET 
				request varies based on the user agent.  Including apiKey:{key value}, 
				(without brackets or spaces) allows users to make a greater number of requests 
				in a given time than they could otherwise.  Please note, the {key value} 
				is case sensitive.
			

				All responses are encoded in the common UTF-8 format and all datetime objects use 
				the ISO-8601 format with zero offset from UTC. The NVD uses conventional 						 
				HTTP response codes to indicate 
				the success or failure of an API request. In general: The 2xx (Successful) class of 
				status code indicates that the client's request was successfully received, understood, 
				and accepted.  The 4xx (Client Error) class of status code indicates that the client 
				seems to have errored based on the information available.  Common causes of a client error 
				include the omission of a required parameter or whenever one or more parameters provided 
				do not exist or are mistyped.  When client errors occur, users should examine the response 
				header for a field named message.  The message field provides 
				additional information to aid users in debugging.  
			

				Under specific circumstances, the API may return a status code 200, indicating that the 
				request has succeeded, while the response body contains no results.  Common causes 
				of this pattern include a valid request with filtering parameters so narrow that no 
				results exist, or valid requests for a specific record in a time frame before the 
				record was published.  
			

				JSON response objects are either optional or required.  Required response objects are 
				always returned by the API and may contain fields without data.  Optional response 
				objects are only returned when they contain data.  For example, in the CVES API the 
				cvssMetricV3 object is optional.  
				CVSSv3.0 was released in 2016, thus most CVE published before 2016 do not include the 
				cvssMetricV3 object. The exception are CVE published before 
				2016 that were later reanalyzed or modified.  These CVE may have been updated to include 
				CVSSv3 information. If the CVE was updated in this way, the API response would include 
				this optional information.  
			


Rate Limits

				NIST firewall rules put in place to prevent denial of service attacks can thwart your 
				application if it exceeds a predetermined rate limit. The public rate limit (without an API key) 
				is 5 requests in a rolling 30 second window; the rate limit with an API key is 50 requests in a 
				rolling 30 second window. Requesting an API key significantly raises the number of requests that 
				can be made in a given time frame. However, it is still recommended that your application sleeps 
				for several seconds between requests so that legitimate requests are not denied, and all requests 
				are responded to in sequence.
			


Request an API Key


					On the API key requests page, enter data into the three fields on the requests form.
				

					Scroll to the bottom of the Terms of Use, and then click the check box marked 
					“I agree to the Terms of Use.”
				

					Check the inbox of the email address provided in the steps above for an email from 
					nvd-noreply@nist.gov.
				

					Activate and view the API Key by opening the single-use hyperlink.  Store the API 
					Key in a secure location as the page will no longer be available after it is closed.  
					If your key is not activated within seven days, the single-use hyperlink will expire.  
				



					Each API Key is associated with a single email address.  If an email address is used 		 
					to request an additional API key, clicking the single-use hyperlink will invalidate 
					the key previously associated with that email address.  The key will not be invalidated 
					if the email address is used to request another key, but the hyperlink is not opened.  
					There is no process for retrieving a forgotten key or confirming whether a key has been 
					requested or activated by any email address.   
				



Best Practices

				When properly implemented, the following practices enable users to efficiently 
				download the complete NVD dataset and to accurately maintain this data using very 
				few requests. To further assist developers working with the APIs, the NVD is  
				documenting the best practices for 
				popular workflows.
			

Initial Data Population



					During initial dataset population, users should start 
					by calling the API beginning with a startIndex of 
					0.  Iterative requests should increment the startIndex  
					by the value of resultsPerPage until the response's 
					startIndex has exceeded the value in 
					totalResults. 
				


Maintaining Data



					After initial data population has occurred, the last modified date parameters provide an 
					efficient way to update a user's local repository  
					and stay within the API rate limits. No more than once every two 
					hours, automated requests should include a range where lastModStartDate 
					equals the time of the last CVE or CPE received and lastModEndDate 
					equals the current time.  
				

					It is recommended that users "sleep" their scripts for six seconds between requests.
				

					It is recommended to use the default resultsPerPage value as this 
					value has been optimized for the API response. 
				

					Enterprise scale development should enforce these practices through a single 
					requestor to ensure all users are in sync and have the latest CVE, Change History, 
					CPE, and CPE match criteria information. 
				



Keep up to date with the NVD

				It is recommended that developers using the NVD API opt into the 
				NVD News Google Group .  This group can be a valuable resource for enterprise 
				application developers and novice researchers alike. 
				The process of requesting an API key requires users to provide a valid email address, 
				but the NVD does not automatically enroll these addresses in any 
				discussion group or mailing list.  About twice a year, the NVD may send a user 
				experience survey to any email addresses that have requested an API key.  
			




				Questions, comments, or concerns may be shared with the NVD by emailing 
				nvd@nist.gov
