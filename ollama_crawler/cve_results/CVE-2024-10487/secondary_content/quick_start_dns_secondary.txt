Manage a DNS nameserver file

A nameserver ensures that the human-readable URLs you type
      in your browser (for example, example.com) resolve to IP addresses that computers can read. This guide helps
      you get started managing a simple Domain Name System (DNS) nameserver file with Puppet.
Before you begin
Before starting this walk-through, complete the previous exercise of setting up NTP
               management.  Log in as root or Administrator on your nodes.


Sysadmins typically need to manage a nameserver file for internal
            resources that aren’t published in public nameservers. For example, suppose you have
            several employee-maintained servers in your infrastructure, and the DNS network assigned
            to those servers use Google’s public nameserver located at 8.8.8.8. However, there are several
            resources behind your company’s firewall that your employees need to access on a regular
            basis. In this case, you’d build a private nameserver (for example at 10.16.22.10), and use Puppet to ensure all the servers in your infrastructure
            have access to it.
In this exercise, you learn how to:


Write a module that contains a class called resolver to manage
                  a nameserver file called /etc/resolv.conf.


Enforce the desired state of that class from the command line
                  of your Puppet agent.




Note: You can add the DNS nameserver class to as many
               agents as needed. For simplicity, this guide describes adding it to only one.




The first step is creating the resolver module and a
               template.

While some modules are large and complex, this module module
                  contains just one class and one template
By default, Puppet keeps modules
                  in an environment’s modulepath, which for the production
                  environment defaults to /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules.
                  This directory contains modules that Puppet
                  installs, those that you download from the Forge,
                  and those you write yourself. 
Note: Puppet creates another module directory: /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/modules. Don’t modify or add anything in
                     this directory.For thorough information about creating and using
                  modules, see Modules fundamentals, the Beginner’s guide to modules, and the  
Puppet
Forge
.
Modules are directory trees. For this task, you’ll create a
                  directory for the resolver module, a subdirectory for its templates, and a template
                  file that Puppet uses to create the /etc/resolv.conf file
                  that manages DNS.



From the command line on the Puppet primary server, navigate to the modules
                     directory: 


cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules




Create the module directory and its templates
                     directory:


mkdir -p resolver/templates




Use your text editor to create a file
                        called resolv.conf.erb inside the resolver/templates directory.


Edit the resolv.conf.erb file to add the
                     following Ruby code: 


 # Resolv.conf generated by Puppet

 <% [@nameservers].flatten.each do |ns| -%>
 nameserver <%= ns %>
 <% end -%>
This
                           Ruby code is a template for
                           populating /etc/resolv.conf correctly, no matter what changes are
                        manually made to /etc/resolv.conf, as you see in a later step.



Save and exit the file.

That’s it! You’ve created a Ruby template to populate /etc/resolv.conf.





Add managing the resolv.conf file to your main
               manifest.


On the primary server, open /etc/resolv.conf with your text editor, and copy the IP address
                     of your primary server’s nameserver. In this example, the nameserver is 10.0.2.3.


Navigate to the main manifest: 


cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests




Use your text editor to open the site.pp file and add the following Puppet code to the default node, making
                     the nameservers value match the one you found
                        in /etc/resolv.conf: 


 $nameservers = ['10.0.2.3']

 file { '/etc/resolv.conf':
   ensure  => file,
   owner   => 'root',
   group   => 'root',
   mode    => '0644',
   content => template('resolver/resolv.conf.erb'),
 }




From the command line on your agent, run Puppet: puppet agent -t

To see the results in the resolve.conf file,
                        run:cat /etc/resolv.confThe
                        file contains the nameserver you added to your main manifest.
That’s it! You’ve written and applied a module that contains a class that
                        ensures your agents resolve to your internal nameserver.
Note the following about your new class:


It ensures the creation of the file /etc/resolv.conf.


The content of /etc/resolv.conf is modified and managed by the
                                 template, resolv.conf.erb.







Finally, let’s take a look at how Puppet ensures the desired state of the resolver class on
               your agents. In the previous task, you set the nameserver IP address. Now, simulate a
               scenario where a member of your team changes the contents of /etc/resolv.conf to use a
               different nameserver and, as a result, can no longer access any internal
               resources:


On the agent to which you applied
                        the resolver class, edit /etc/resolv.conf to contain any
                     nameserver IP address other than the one you want to use.


Save and exit the file.


Now, fix the mistake you've introduced. From the
                     command line on your agent, run: puppet agent -t --onetime
To
                        see the resulting contents of the managed file,
                           run:cat /etc/resolv.conf
Puppet has enforced the desired state of the
                        agent node by changing the nameserver value back to what you specified in
                           site.pp
                        on the primary server.
