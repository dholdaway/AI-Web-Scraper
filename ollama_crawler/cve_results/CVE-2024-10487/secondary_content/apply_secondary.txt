Man Page: puppet apply
NOTE: This page was generated from the Puppet source code on 2022-02-07 10:05:17 -0800
NAME
puppet-apply - Apply Puppet manifests locallySYNOPSIS
Applies a standalone Puppet manifest to the local system.USAGE
puppet apply [-h|--help] [-V|--version] [-d|--debug]
[-v|--verbose] [-e|--execute] [--detailed-exitcodes]
[-L|--loadclasses] [-l|--logdest syslog|eventlog|ABS
FILEPATH|console] [--noop] [--catalog catalog]
[--write-catalog-summary] fileSYNTAX EXAMPLE
$ puppet apply -e 'notify { "hello world": }'DESCRIPTION

This is the standalone puppet execution tool; use it to apply individual
manifests.
When provided with a modulepath, via command line or config file, puppet
apply can effectively mimic the catalog that would be served by puppet
master with access to the same modules, although there are some subtle
differences. When combined with scheduling and an automated system for
pushing manifests, this can be used to implement a serverless Puppet
site.
Most users should use 'puppet agent' and 'puppet master' for
site-wide manifests.
OPTIONS

Any setting that's valid in the configuration file is a valid long
argument for puppet apply. For example, 'tags' is a valid setting, so
you can specify '--tags class,tag' as an argument.
See the configuration file documentation at
https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/configuration.html for the full
list of acceptable parameters. You can generate a commented list of all
configuration options by running puppet with '--genconfig'.

--debug: Enable full debugging.

--detailed-exitcodes: Provide extra information about the run via
exit codes. If enabled, 'puppet apply' will use the following exit
codes:
0: The run succeeded with no changes or failures; the system was
already in the desired state.
1: The run failed.
2: The run succeeded, and some resources were changed.
4: The run succeeded, and some resources failed.
6: The run succeeded, and included both changes and failures.

--help: Print this help message
--loadclasses: Load any stored classes. 'puppet agent' caches
configured classes (usually at /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/classes.txt),
and setting this option causes all of those classes to be set in
your puppet manifest.

--logdest: Where to send log messages. Choose between 'syslog'
(the POSIX syslog service), 'eventlog' (the Windows Event Log),
'console', or the path to a log file. Defaults to 'console'.
Multiple destinations can be set using a comma separated list (eg:
/path/file1,console,/path/file2)"
A path ending with '.json' will receive structured output in JSON
format. The log file will not have an ending ']' automatically
written to it due to the appending nature of logging. It must be
appended manually to make the content valid JSON.
A path ending with '.jsonl' will receive structured output in JSON
Lines format.

--noop: Use 'noop' mode where Puppet runs in a no-op or dry-run
mode. This is useful for seeing what changes Puppet will make
without actually executing the changes.
--execute: Execute a specific piece of Puppet code
--test: Enable the most common options used for testing. These are
'verbose', 'detailed-exitcodes' and 'show_diff'.
--verbose: Print extra information.
--catalog: Apply a JSON catalog (such as one generated with
'puppet master --compile'). You can either specify a JSON file or
pipe in JSON from standard input.
--write-catalog-summary After compiling the catalog saves the
resource list and classes list to the node in the state directory
named classes.txt and resources.txt
