Man Page: puppet device
NOTE: This page was generated from the Puppet source code on 2022-02-07 10:05:18 -0800
NAME
puppet-device - Manage remote network devicesSYNOPSIS

Retrieves catalogs from the Puppet master and applies them to remote
devices.
This subcommand can be run manually; or periodically using cron, a
scheduled task, or a similar tool.
USAGE
puppet device [-h|--help] [-v|--verbose] [-d|--debug]
[-l|--logdest syslog|file|console] [--detailed-exitcodes]
[--deviceconfig file] [-w|--waitforcert seconds] [--libdir
directory] [-a|--apply file] [-f|--facts] [-r|--resource
type [name]] [-t|--target device] [--user=user]
[-V|--version]DESCRIPTION
Devices require a proxy Puppet agent to request certificates, collect
facts, retrieve and apply catalogs, and store reports.USAGE NOTES

Devices managed by the puppet-device subcommand on a Puppet agent are
configured in device.conf, which is located at $confdir/device.conf by
default, and is configurable with the $deviceconfig setting.
The device.conf file is an INI-like file, with one section per device:
[DEVICE_CERTNAME] type TYPE url URL debug
The section name specifies the certname of the device.
The values for the type and url properties are specific to each type of
device.
The optional debug property specifies transport-level debugging, and is
limited to telnet and ssh transports.
See https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/config_file_device.html for
details.
OPTIONS

Note that any setting that's valid in the configuration file is also a
valid long argument. For example, 'server' is a valid configuration
parameter, so you can specify '--server servername' as an argument.

--help, -h
Print this help message
--verbose, -v
Turn on verbose reporting.
--debug, -d
Enable full debugging.
--logdest, -l

Where to send log messages. Choose between 'syslog' (the POSIX
syslog service), 'console', or the path to a log file. If
debugging or verbosity is enabled, this defaults to 'console'.
Otherwise, it defaults to 'syslog'. Multiple destinations can be
set using a comma separated list (eg:
/path/file1,console,/path/file2)"
A path ending with '.json' will receive structured output in JSON
format. The log file will not have an ending ']' automatically
written to it due to the appending nature of logging. It must be
appended manually to make the content valid JSON.

--detailed-exitcodes
Provide transaction information via exit codes. If this is enabled,
an exit code of '1' means at least one device had a compile
failure, an exit code of '2' means at least one device had
resource changes, and an exit code of '4' means at least one
device had resource failures. Exit codes of '3', '5', '6', or
'7' means that a bitwise combination of the preceding exit codes
happened.
--deviceconfig
Path to the device config file for puppet device. Default:
$confdir/device.conf
--waitforcert, -w
This option only matters for targets that do not yet have
certificates and it is enabled by default, with a value of 120
(seconds). This causes +puppet device+ to poll the server every 2
minutes and ask it to sign a certificate request. This is useful for
the initial setup of a target. You can turn off waiting for
certificates by specifying a time of 0.
--libdir

Override the per-device libdir with a local directory. Specifying a
libdir also disables pluginsync. This is useful for testing.
A path ending with '.jsonl' will receive structured output in JSON
Lines format.

--apply
Apply a manifest against a remote target. Target must be specified.
--facts
Displays the facts of a remote target. Target must be specified.
--resource
Displays a resource state as Puppet code, roughly equivalent to
puppet resource. Can be filtered by title. Requires --target be
specified.
--target
Target a specific device/certificate in the device.conf. Doing so
will perform a device run against only that device/certificate.
--to_yaml
Output found resources in yaml format, suitable to use with Hiera
and create_resources.
--user
The user to run as.
