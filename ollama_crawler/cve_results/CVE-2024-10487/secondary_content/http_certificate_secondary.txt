Certificate

The certificate endpoint returns the certificate for the specified name,
which might be either a standard certname or ca.
Most of the certificate authority (CA) application programming interface (API) requires admin access. To obtain a certificate that has admin access, use the pp_cli_auth flag. For more information, see Puppet-specific registered IDs.
