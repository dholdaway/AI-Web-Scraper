On your computer, open Chrome.
At the top right, select More .
If an update is pending, you'll find:
    
"Relaunch to update"
"Finish update"
"New Chrome available"




To update Google Chrome:

On your computer, open Chrome.
At the top right, click More .
Click Help  About Google Chrome.
Click Update Google Chrome.
    
Important: If you can't find this button, you're on the latest version.


Click Relaunch.

The browser saves your opened tabs and windows and reopens them automatically when it restarts. Your Incognito windows won't reopen when Chrome restarts. If you'd prefer not to restart right away, click Not now. The next time you restart your browser, the update will be applied.
