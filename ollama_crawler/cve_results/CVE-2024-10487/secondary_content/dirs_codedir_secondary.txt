Code and data directory (codedir)

The codedir is the main directory for Puppet code and
      data. It is used by the primary Puppet server and Puppet apply, but not by Puppet
      agent. It contains environments (which contain your manifests and modules) and a global
      modules directory for all environments.
Location
The codedir is located in one of the following locations: 


*nix: /etc/puppetlabs/code




*nix non-root users: ~/.puppetlabs/etc/code




Windows: %PROGRAMDATA%\PuppetLabs\code (usually C:\ProgramData\PuppetLabs\code) 



When Puppet is running as root, as a Windows user with administrator privileges, or as the
               puppet user, it uses a system-wide codedir. When
            running as a non-root user, it uses a codedir in that user's home directory.
When running Puppet commands and services as root or puppet, use the
            system codedir. To use the same codedir as the Puppet
            agent, or the primary server, run admin commands such as puppet module with sudo.
To configure the location of the codedir, set the 
codedir
 setting in your puppet.conf file, such as:
            codedir = /etc/puppetlabs/code



Important:
Puppet Server doesn't use the codedir setting in puppet.conf, and instead uses the 
                  jruby-puppet.master-code-dir setting in 
puppetserver.conf
. When using a non-default codedir, you must change both settings.


Interpolation of $codedir

The value of the codedir is discovered before other settings, so you can refer to it in
            other puppet.conf settings by using the $codedir variable in the value. For example, the
               $codedir variable is used as part of the value for the
               environmentpath setting:
            [server]
   environmentpath = $codedir/override_environments:$codedir/environments

This allows you to avoid absolute paths in your settings and keep your Puppet-related files together.

Contents
The codedir contains environments, including manifests and modules, and a global modules
            directory for all environments.
The code and data directories are: 


environments
: Contains alternate versions of the modules and manifests directories, to
                  enable code changes to be tested on smaller sets of nodes before entering
                  production. 


modules
: The main directory for modules.
