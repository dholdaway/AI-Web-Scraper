Advanced Search

 




Find a specific bug by entering words that describe it.  
Bugzilla will search bug descriptions and comments
for those words and return a list of matching bugs sorted
by relevance.


For example, if the bug you are looking for is a browser crash when you go to a secure web site with an embedded Flash animation, you might search
for "crash secure SSL flash".
