Manage firewall rules

With a firewall, admins define firewall rules, which sets a
    policy for things like application ports (TCP/UDP), network ports, IP addresses, and accept-deny
    statements. This guide helps you get started managing firewall rules with Puppet.
Before you begin
Before starting this
        walk-through, complete the previous exercises in the common configuration tasks.
Ensure youâ€™ve already 
                    installed Puppet, and at least one  *nix agent. Also, log in as
                root or Administrator on your nodes.
 Firewall rules are applied
        with a top-to-bottom approach. For example, when a service, say SSH, attempts to access
        resources on the other side of a firewall, the firewall applies a list of rules to determine
        if or how SSH communications are handled. If a rule allowing SSH access canâ€™t be found, the
        firewall denies access to that SSH attempt.
To best way to manage
        firewall rules with Puppet is to divide them
          into pre and post groups to ensure Puppet checks them in
        the correct order.
Using this guide, you learn how to:

Install the puppetlabs-firewall module.
Write a module to define the firewall rules
            for your Puppet managed infrastructure.
Add the firewall module to the main
            manifest.
Enforce the desired state using
              the my_firewall class.



The first step is installing the puppetlabs-firewall module from the
            Puppet
Forge. The module introduces the firewall resource, which is used to manage and
          configure firewall rules. For more information about the 
puppetlabs-firewall
 module, see its 
            README. To install the module, on the primary server, run:

puppet module install puppetlabs-firewall

The resulting
            output is similar to
            this:Preparing to install into /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/production/modules ...
    Notice: Downloading from https://forgeapi.puppetlabs.com ...
    Notice: Installing -- do not interrupt ...
    /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/production/modules
    â””â”€â”€ puppetlabs-firewall (v1.6.0)That's
            it! Youâ€™ve just installed the firewall module.


Next, you'll write the my_firewall module, which contains three
          classes. You'll create the my_firewall module directory, its manifests subdirectory, a pre.pp manifest file and a post.pp manifest file.


From the command line on the primary server, navigate to the
              modules directory:

cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules



Create the module directory and its manifests
              directory: 

mkdir -p my_firewall/manifests



From the manifests directory, use your text editor to
                create pre.pp.


The pre rules are rules that the firewall applies when
              a service requests access. It is run before any other rules. Edit pre.pp so it contains the
              following Puppet code:

class my_firewall::pre {
  Firewall {
    require => undef,
  }
     firewall { '000 accept all icmp':
       proto  => 'icmp',
       action => 'accept',
     }
     firewall { '001 accept all to lo interface':
       proto   => 'all',
       iniface => 'lo',
       action  => 'accept',
     }
     firewall { '002 reject local traffic not on loopback interface':
       iniface     => '! lo',
       proto       => 'all',
       destination => '127.0.0.1/8',
       action      => 'reject',
     }
     firewall { '003 accept related established rules':
       proto  => 'all',
       state  => ['RELATED', 'ESTABLISHED'],
       action => 'accept',
     }
   }These
                default rules allow basic networking to ensure that existing connections are not
                closed. 


Save and exit the file.


From the manifests directory, use your text editor to
                create post.pp.


The post rules tell the firewall to drop requests that
              havenâ€™t met the rules defined by pre.pp or in site.pp. Edit post.pp so it contains the following Puppet code: 

 class my_firewall::post {
     firewall { '999 drop all':
       proto  => 'all',
       action => 'drop',
       before => undef,
     }
   }



Save and exit the file.
Thatâ€™s it! Youâ€™ve
                written a module that contains a class that, after it's applied, ensures your
                firewall has rules in it that are managed by Puppet.
              




Now you'll add the firewall module to the main manifest so that Puppet is managing firewall configuration on nodes.


On the primary server, navigate to the main manifest:

cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests



Use your text editor to open site.pp.


Add the following Puppet code to your site.pp file: 

  resources { 'firewall':
     purge => true,
   }This
                clears any existing rules and make sure that only rules defined in Puppet exist on the machine.


Add the following Puppet code to your site.pp file: 

 Firewall {
     before  => Class['my_firewall::post'],
     require => Class['my_firewall::pre'],
   }

   class { ['my_firewall::pre', 'my_firewall::post']: }These
                settings ensure that the pre and post classes are run in
                  the correct order to avoid locking you out of your
                node during the first Puppet run, and
                  declaring my_firewall::pre and my_firewall::post satisfies the specified
                dependencies.


Add the firewall class to your site.pp to ensure the correct packages
              are installed:

class { 'firewall': }



To apply the configuration, on the agent, run Puppet: puppet agent -t

That's it!
                Puppet is now managing the firewall configuration on the agent. 


To check your firewall configuration, on the agent,
              run: iptables --list

The
                resulting output is similar to
                this:Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination
ACCEPT     icmp --  anywhere             anywhere            /* 000 accept all icmp */
ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere            /* 001 accept all to lo interface */
REJECT     all  --  anywhere             loopback/8          /* 002 reject local traffic not on loopback interface */ reject-with icmp-port-unreachable
ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere            /* 003 accept related established rules */ state RELATED,ESTABLISHED
DROP       all  --  anywhere             anywhere            /* 999 drop all */

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination





Finally, letâ€™s take a look at how Puppet ensures the desired state of the my_firewall class on your agents. In
          the previous step, you applied the firewall rules. Now, simulate a scenario where a member
          of your team changes the contents the iptables to allow connections on a random port that was not
          specified in my_firewall:


On an agent where you applied the my_firewall class, run: 

iptables --listNote
                that the rules from the my_firewall class have been applied.


From the command line, add a rule to allow connections
              to port 8449 by running:

iptables -I INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 8449 -j ACCEPT



Run iptables --list again and see that this new rule is now
              listed.


Run Puppet on that
              agent: 

puppet agent -t --onetime



Run iptables --list on that node one more time, and notice
              that Puppet has enforced the desired state you
              specified for the firewall rules
Thatâ€™s it! Puppet has enforced the desired state of your
                agent.
