Catalog compilation

When configuring a node, the agent uses a document called
        a catalog, which it downloads from the primary server. For each resource under management, the
        catalog describes its desired state and can specify ordered dependency
        information.

Puppet manifests are concise because they can express
            variation between nodes with conditional logic, templates, and functions. Puppet resolves these on the primary server and gives the agent a
            specific catalog.
This allows Puppet to:


Separate privileges, because each node receives only its own
                    resources.
Reduce the agent’s CPU and memory consumption.
Simulate changes by running the agent in no-op mode,
                    checking the agent's current state and reporting what would have changed without
                    making any changes.
Query PuppetDB for
                    information about managed resources on any node.




Note: The puppet apply command compiles the catalog on its own node and then
                applies it, so it plays the role of both primary server and agent. To compile a catalog on
                the primary server for testing, run puppet catalog
                    compile on the puppetserver with access to your environments, modules, manifests, and
                    Hiera data.For more information about PuppetDB queries, see 
PuppetDB API.

Puppet compiles a catalog using three sources of
            configuration information: 

Agent-provided data


External data


Manifests and modules, including associated templates and file sources

These sources are used by both agent-server deployments and by stand-alone puppet apply nodes. 
Agent-provided data
When an agent requests a catalog, it sends four pieces of information to the primary
                server:


The node's name, which is almost always the same as the node's certname
                        and is embedded in the request URL. For example, /puppet/v3/catalog/web01.example.com?environment=production.

The node's certificate, which contains its certname and sometimes
                            additional information that can be used for policy-based autosigning and
                            adding new trusted facts. This is the one item not used by puppet apply.


The node's facts.

The node's requested environment, which is embedded in the request URL.
                        For example, /puppet/v3/catalog/web01.example.com?environment=production.
                        Before requesting a catalog, the agent requests its environment from the
                        primary server. If the primary server doesn't provide an environment, the
                        environment information in the agent's config file is used.


For more information about additional data in certs see SSL
                    configuration: CSR attributes and certificate extensions


External data

Puppet uses two main kinds of external data during
                catalog compilation: 


Data from an external node classifier (ENC) or other node terminus, which is
                        available before compilation starts. This data is in the form of a node
                        object and can contain any of the following: 
Classes
Class configuration parameters
Top-scope variables for the node
Environment information, which overrides the environment information
                                in the agent's configuration 


Data from other sources, which can be invoked by the main manifest or by
                        classes or defined types in modules. This kind of data includes: 
Exported resources queried from PuppetDB. 
The results of functions, which can access data sources including
                                    Hiera or an external
                                configuration management database.




For more information about ENCs, see Writing
                    external node classifiers


Manifests and modules
Manifests and modules are at the center of a Puppet
                deployment, including the main manifest, modules downloaded from the 
Forge
, and modules written specifically for your site. 
For more information about manifests and modules, see The main manifest
                    directory and Module fundamentals.

The catalog compilation process 
This simplified description doesn’t delve into the internals of the parser, model,
                and the evaluator. Some items are presented out of order for the sake of clarity.
                This process begins after the catalog request has been received. 


Note: For practical purposes, treat puppet apply nodes
                    as a combined agent and primary server.




Retrieve the node object. 
After the primary server has received the agent-provided
                                    information for this request, it asks its configured node
                                    terminus for a node object. 
By default, the primary server uses the plain node terminus, which returns a blank node
                                    object. In this case, only manifests and agent-provided
                                    information are used in compilation. 
The next most common node terminus is the exec node terminus, which requests data from an
                                    ENC. This can return classes, variables, an environment, or a
                                    combination of the three, depending on how the ENC is designed. 
You can also write a custom node terminus that retrieves
                                    classes, variables, and environments from an external
                                    system.




Set variables from the node object, from facts, and from the certificate. 
All of these variables are available for use by any manifest or
                                    template during subsequent stages of compilation. 
The node’s facts are set as top-scope variables.
The node’s facts are set in the protected $facts hash, and certain data from the node’s
                                    certificate is set in the protected $trusted hash. 
Any variables provided by the primary server are set. 




Evaluate the main manifest. 

Puppet parses the main manifest.
                                    The node’s environment can specify a main manifest; if it
                                    doesn’t, the primary server uses the main manifest from the
                                    agent's config file. 
If there are node definitions in the manifest, Puppet must find one that matches
                                    the node’s name. If at least one node definition is present and
                                        Puppet cannot find a match,
                                    it fails compilation. 
Code outside of node definitions is evaluated. Resources in the
                                    code are added to the are added to the node's catalog, and any
                                    classes declared in the code are loaded and declared.
Note: Classes are usually classes are defined in
                                        modules, although the main manifest can also contain class
                                        definitions.

If a matching node definition is found, the code in it is
                                    evaluated at node scope, overriding any top-scope variables.
                                    Resources in the code are added to the are added to the node's
                                    catalog, and any classes declared in the code are loaded and
                                    declared.




Load and evaluate classes from modules 

If classes were declared in the main manifest and their
                                        definitions were not present, Puppet loads the manifests
                                        containing them from its collection of modules. It follows
                                        the normal manifest naming conventions to find the files it
                                        should load. The set of locations Puppet loads modules from is
                                        called the modulepath. The primary server serves each
                                        environment with its own modulepath. When a class is loaded,
                                        the Puppet code in it is
                                        evaluated, and any resources in it are added to the catalog.
                                        If it was declared at node scope, it has access to
                                        node-scope variables; otherwise, it has access to only
                                        top-scope variables. Classes can also declare other classes;
                                        if they do, Puppet loads and
                                        evaluates those in the same way. 





Evaluate classes from the node object 


Puppet loads from modules and
                                        evaluate any classes that were specified by the node object.
                                        Resources from those classes are added to the catalog. If a
                                        matching node definition was found when the main manifest
                                        was evaluated, these classes are evaluated at node scope,
                                        which means that they can access any node-scope variables
                                        set by the main manifest. If no node definitions were
                                        present in the main manifest, they are evaluated at top
                                        scope.
