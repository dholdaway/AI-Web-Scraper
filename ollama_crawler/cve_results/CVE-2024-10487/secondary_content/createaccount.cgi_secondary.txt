  To create a Gentoo's Bugzilla account, all you need to do is to enter
  a legitimate email address.
  You will receive an email at this address to confirm the creation of your
  account. You will not be able to log in until you receive the email.
  If it doesn't arrive within a reasonable amount of time, you may contact
  the maintainer of this Bugzilla installation
  at bugzilla@gentoo.org.


  If you already have an account and want to change your
    email address,
  you can change it from the Preferences page after logging in.


  A user account is required to report new bugs or to comment into
  existing ones, as you may be contacted for more information if needed.
  This also lets other users clearly identify who is the author of comments
  or changes made into bugs. Note that your email address will
  never be displayed to logged out users. Only registered users will be
  able to see it.


PRIVACY NOTICE: Gentoo's Bugzilla is an open bug
  tracking system. Activity on most bugs, including email
  addresses, will be visible to registered users. We recommend using a
  secondary account or free web email service (such as Gmail, Yahoo,
  Hotmail, or similar) to avoid receiving spam at your primary email address.


Please do not use temporary/throwaway email addresses to register, they cause
too many mail bounces later when developers follow up bugs.


To prevent spam, new accounts are forbidden from posting URLs in comments
for the first 24 hours. We are sorry for the inconvenience.
