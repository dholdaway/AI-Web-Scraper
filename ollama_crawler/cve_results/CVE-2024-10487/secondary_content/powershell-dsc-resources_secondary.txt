PowerShell DSC Resources

Desired State Configuration (DSC) is a
        configuration framework in PowerShell that enables you to
        manage your infrastructure with configuration as code. 
DSC resources are similar to Puppet resources —
            they let you specify the desired state of an item on a node you managed. These resources
            can be small, such as xInternetExplorerHomePage, or large,
            such as xExchange. The PowerShell Gallery is a repository for finding and
            sharing DSC resources — similar to Puppet Forge. 
Managing DSC resources with Puppet


Puppet allows you to manage DSC resources
                directly by installing them from Puppet
Forge. Once you have added the DSC module to your
                    Puppetfile and deployed it to your code base, you can declare
                the DSC resources. For example, if you deploy the dsc-xinternetexplorerhomepage
                module, you declare the resources in your Puppet code
                like this:dsc_xinternetexplorerhomepage { 'homepage':
  dsc_ensure    => 'Present',
  dsc_startpage => 'https://puppet.com',
}

The dsc-xexchange module allows you to
                manage an entire MS Exchange server using resource types and parameters for
                configuration.
You can find all of the PowerShell DSC modules on the Forge.
                Install them and use them like you would any other Puppet module. You can find the parameter
                documentation on the References tab of each module's Forge page (or via puppet describe). If the module author did not fully
                document the DSC resource, the Forge might only
                include a list of parameters and valid data types. For more information, you can
                click the Project URL link at the top of the module page to see the documentation
                source repository. Note that each parameter of the original DSC resource starts with
                    dsc_ when used with Puppet.


Puppet’s support policy for PowerShell DSC modules
The PowerShell DSC modules are different
                from other modules on the Forge. DSC Modules are
                auto-generated and mostly consist of vendored code that is not owned by Puppet. While the modules are approved for use with
                    Puppet, Puppet
                does not support the vendored DSC content inside the module.




Convert private DSC Resources to a Puppet moduleIf you have private DSC resources, you can convert them to a Puppet module.

Distributing arbitrary DSC resourcesYou can use the puppetlabs-dsc_lite module to manage target nodes         with arbitrary DSC resources. 

Upgrading Puppet DSC modulesThe Puppet.dsc PowerShell module is the third Puppet DSC module. The puppetlabs-dsc module         is now deprecated and the puppetlabs-dsc_lite module is for advanced use         cases only. To upgrade to the Puppet.dsc module, follow the upgrading         instructions below.

Troubleshooting DSC ResourcesUse this guide to troubleshoot issues with Puppet code         containing DSC resources.
