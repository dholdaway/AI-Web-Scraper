Man Page: puppet facts
NOTE: This page was generated from the Puppet source code on 2022-02-07 10:05:19 -0800
NAME
puppet-facts - Retrieve and store facts.SYNOPSIS
puppet facts action [--terminus _TERMINUS]DESCRIPTION
This subcommand manages facts, which are collections of normalized
system information used by Puppet. It can read facts directly from the
local system (with the default facter terminus).OPTIONS

Note that any setting that's valid in the configuration file is also a
valid long argument, although it may or may not be relevant to the
present action. For example, server and run_mode are valid
settings, so you can specify --server <servername>, or
--run_mode <runmode> as an argument.
See the configuration file documentation at
https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/configuration.html for the full
list of acceptable parameters. A commented list of all configuration
options can also be generated by running puppet with --genconfig.

--render-as FORMAT
The format in which to render output. The most common formats are
json, s (string), yaml, and console, but other
options such as dot are sometimes available.
--verbose
Whether to log verbosely.
--debug
Whether to log debug information.
--extra HASH
A terminus can take additional arguments to refine the operation,
which are passed as an arbitrary hash to the back-end. Anything
passed as the extra value is just send direct to the back-end.
--terminus _TERMINUS

Indirector faces expose indirected subsystems of Puppet. These
subsystems are each able to retrieve and alter a specific type of
data (with the familiar actions of find, search, save,
and destroy) from an arbitrary number of pluggable backends. In
Puppet parlance, these backends are called terminuses.
Almost all indirected subsystems have a rest terminus that
interacts with the puppet master's data. Most of them have
additional terminuses for various local data models, which are in
turn used by the indirected subsystem on the puppet master whenever
it receives a remote request.
The terminus for an action is often determined by context, but
occasionally needs to be set explicitly. See the "Notes" section
of this face's manpage for more details.


ACTIONS


find - Retrieve a node's facts.

SYNOPSIS
puppet facts find [--terminus _TERMINUS] [node_certname]
DESCRIPTION
Retrieve a node's facts.
RETURNS
A hash containing some metadata and (under the "values" key) the
set of facts for the requested node. When used from the Ruby API: A
Puppet::Node::Facts object.
RENDERING ISSUES: Facts cannot currently be rendered as a string;
use yaml or json.
NOTES
When using the facter terminus, the host argument is ignored.


info - Print the default terminus class for this face.

SYNOPSIS
puppet facts info [--terminus _TERMINUS]
DESCRIPTION
Prints the default terminus class for this subcommand. Note that
different run modes may have different default termini; when in
doubt, specify the run mode with the '--run_mode' option.


save - API only: create or overwrite an object.

SYNOPSIS
puppet facts save [--terminus _TERMINUS] key
DESCRIPTION
API only: create or overwrite an object. As the Faces framework does
not currently accept data from STDIN, save actions cannot currently
be invoked from the command line.


show - Retrieve current node's facts.

SYNOPSIS
puppet facts [--terminus _TERMINUS] [--config-file path]
[--custom-dir path] [--external-dir path] [--no-block]
[--no-cache] [--show-legacy] [--value-only] [--timing]
[facts]
DESCRIPTION
Reads facts from the local system using facter terminus. A query
can be provided to retrieve just a specific fact or a set of facts.
OPTIONS --config-file <path> - The location of the config
file for Facter.
--custom-dir <path> - The path to a directory that contains
custom facts.
--external-dir <path> - The path to a directory that contains
external facts.
--no-block - Disable fact blocking mechanism.
--no-cache - Disable fact caching mechanism.
--show-legacy - Show legacy facts when querying all facts.
--timing - Show how much time it took to resolve each fact.
--value-only - Show only the value when the action is called with
a single query
RETURNS
The output of facter with added puppet specific facts.
NOTES


upload - Upload local facts to the puppet master.

SYNOPSIS
puppet facts upload [--terminus _TERMINUS]
DESCRIPTION
Reads facts from the local system using the facter terminus,
then saves the returned facts using the rest terminus.
RETURNS
Nothing.
NOTES
This action requires that the Puppet Server's auth.conf file
allow PUT or save access to the /puppet/v3/facts API
endpoint.
For details on configuring Puppet Server's auth.conf, see:
https://puppet.com/docs/puppetserver/latest/config_file_auth.html

EXAMPLES

find
Get facts from the local system:
$ puppet facts find
show
retrieve facts:
$ puppet facts show os
upload
Upload facts:
$ puppet facts upload
NOTES

This subcommand is an indirector face, which exposes find,
search, save, and destroy actions for an indirected
subsystem of Puppet. Valid termini for this face include:

facter
json
memory
network_device
rest
store_configs
yaml
