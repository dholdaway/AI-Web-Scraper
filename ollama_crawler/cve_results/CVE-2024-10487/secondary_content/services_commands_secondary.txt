Puppet commands

Puppet’s command line
        interface (CLI) consists of a single puppet command with many subcommands.
Puppet Server and Puppet’s companion utilities  
Facter
 and  
Hiera
, have their own CLI.

Puppet agent
Puppet agent is a core service that
                manages systems, with the help of a Puppet primary server. It
                requests a configuration catalog from a Puppet primary server
                server, then ensures that all resources in that catalog are in their desired
                state.
For more information, see:

Puppet Server

Using Puppet code and various other
                data sources, Puppet Server compiles configurations for any
                number of Puppet agents.
Puppet Server is a core service and has
                its own subcommand, puppetserver, which isn’t prefaced by the usual puppet subcommand.
For more information, see:

Puppet apply
Puppet apply is a core command that
                manages systems without contacting a Puppet primary
                server. Using Puppet modules and various other data
                sources, it compiles its own configuration catalog, and then immediately applies the
                catalog.
For more information, see:

Puppet ssl
Puppet ssl is a command for
                managing SSL keys and certificates for Puppet SSL
                clients needing to communicate with your Puppetinfrastructure. 
Puppet ssl usage: puppet ssl <action> [--certname <name>]
Possible actions:



submit request: Generate a certificate signing request
                            (CSR) and submit it to the CA. If a private and public key pair already
                            exist, they are used to generate the CSR. Otherwise, a new key pair is
                            generated. If a CSR has already been submitted with the given certname,
                            then the operation fails.


download_cert: Download a certificate for this host. If
                            the current private key matches the downloaded certificate, then the
                            certificate is saved and used for subsequent requests. If there is
                            already an existing certificate, it is overwritten.


verify: Verify that the private key and
                            certificate are present and match. Verify the certificate is issued
                            by a trusted CA, and check the revocation status


bootstrap: Perform all of the steps necessary to request and
                        download a client certificate. If autosigning is disabled, then puppet will
                        wait every waitforcert
                        seconds for its certificate to be signed. To only attempt once and never
                        wait, specify a time of 0. Since waitforcert is a Puppet setting, it can be specified as a time
                        interval, such as 30s, 5m, 1h.


For more information, see the SSL man page. 


Puppet module
Puppet module is a multi-purpose
                administrative tool for working with Puppet modules.
                It can install and upgrade new modules from the Puppet Forge, help generate new modules, and package modules
                for public release.
For more information, see:
