Files and paths on Windows



Puppet and Windows handle
        directory separators and line endings in files somewhat differently, so you must be aware of
        the differences when you are writing manifests to manage Windows systems.
Directory separators in file paths
Several resource types (including file, exec, and package) take
                file paths as values for various attributes. The Puppet language uses the backslash (\) as an escape
                character in quoted strings. However, Windows also
                uses the backslash to separate directories in file paths, such as C:\Program Files\PuppetLabs. Additionally, Windows file system APIs accept both backslashes and
                forward slashes in file paths, but some Windows
                programs accept only backslashes.
Generally, if Puppet itself is interpreting the file
                path, or if the file path is meant for the primary server, use forward slashes. If
                the file path is being passed directly to a Windows
                program, use backslashes. The following table lists common directory path uses and
                what kind of slashes are required by each. 





File path usage
Slash type



Template paths, such as template('my_module/content.erb').
Forward slash (/)



puppet:/// URLs.
Forward slash (/)


The path attribute or title of a
                                file resource.
Forward slash (/) or backslash
                                (\)


The source attribute of a package resource.
Forward slash (/) or backslash
                                (\)


Local paths in a file resource's
                                source attribute.
Forward slash (/) or backslash
                                (\)


The command of an exec resource. However, some executables,
                            such as cmd.exe, require backslashes.
Forward slash (/) or backslash
                                (\)


Any file paths included in the command of a scheduled_task resource.
Backslash (\)


Any file paths included in the install_options of a package resource.
Backslash (\)


Any file paths used for Windows
PowerShell DSC resources. For these
                            resources, single quote strings whenever possible.
Backslash (\)





Line endings in files

Windows uses CRLF line endings instead of *nix's LF line endings. Be aware of the following
                issues: 

If you specify the contents of a file with the content
                            attribute, Puppet writes the content in
                            binary mode. To create files with CRLF line endings, specify the
                                \r\n escape sequence as part of the content.


When downloading a file to a Windows node
                            with the source attribute, Puppet transfers the file in binary mode,
                            leaving the original newlines untouched.

If you are using version control, such as Git, ensure that it is configured to use CRLF line endings.

Non-file resource types that make partial edits to a
                            system file, such as the 
host resource type, which manages the
                                %windir%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts file, manage
                            their files in text mode and automatically translate between Windows and *nix line endings. 
Note:  When writing
                                your own resource types, you can get this behavior by using the
                                    flat file type.
