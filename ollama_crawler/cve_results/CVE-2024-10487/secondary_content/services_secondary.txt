Services endpoint

The services endpoint of Puppet Server's Status API provides information about
services running on Puppet Server. As of Puppet Server 2.6.0, the endpoint provides
information about memory usage similar to the data produced by the Java MemoryMXBean,
as well as basic data on the pupppetserver process's state and uptime. See the
Java MemoryMXBean documentation
for help interpreting the memory information.

Note: This is an experimental feature provided for troubleshooting
purposes. In future releases, the services endpoint's response payload might
change without warning.
For information about HTTP client metrics, which are served from the status endpoint,
see their documentation.


GET /status/v1/services
(Introduced in Puppet Server 2.6.0)
Supported HTTP methods
GETSupported formats
JSONQuery parameters

level (optional): The response includes status information for all
registered services at the requested level of detail. Default: info. Valid
values:

critical: Returns the minimum amount of status information for each
service. This level returns data quickly and is suitable for frequently
updating uses, such as health checks for a load balancer.
info: Returns more info than the critical level for each service.
The specific data depends on the implementation details of the services
loaded in the application, but generally includes enough human-readable
data to provide a quick impression of each service's health and status.
debug: This level returns status information about a service in enough
detail to be suitable for debugging issues with the puppetserver
process. Depending on the service, this level can be significantly more
expensive than lower levels, reduce the process's performance, and
generate large amounts of data. This level is suitable for producing
aggregate metrics about the performance or resource usage of Puppet
Server's subsystems.

The information returned for any service at each increasing level of detail
includes the data from lower levels. In other words, the info level returns
the same data structure as the critical level, and might provide additional
data in the status field depending on the service. Likewise, the debug
level returns the same data structure as info, and might also add additional
information in the status field.
Response

The services endpoint's response includes information for each service about
which the Status service is aware. Each service's state value is one of the
following:

running, if and only if all services are running
error if any service reports an error
starting if any service reports that it is starting, and no service reports
an error or that it is stopping
stopping if any service reports that it is stopping and no service reports
an error
unknown if any service reports an unknown state and no services report an
error

Requests to this endpoint return one of the following status codes:

200 when all services are in running state.
404 when a requested service is not found.
503 when the service state is unknown, error, starting, or stopping

}Authorization

Requests to the services endpoint are authorized by the
Trapperkeeper-based authorization process as of Puppet
Server 5.3.0. For more information about the supported Puppet Server
authorization processes and configuration settings, see the
auth.conf documentation.
One may also restrict access to the status service by changing the
client-auth setting to required for the webserver. See
Configuring the Webserver Service
for more information on the client-auth setting.
