Software Identification Tags SWID Tags

		The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)
		publishes, ISO/IEC 19770-2, a standard for software identification (SWID) tags that defines a structured metadata
		format for describing a software product. A SWID tag document is composed of a structured set of data elements
		that identify the software product, characterize the product's version, the organizations and individuals 
		that had a role in the production and distribution of the product, information about the artifacts that comprise 
		a software product, relationships between software products, and other descriptive metadata. The information in a
		SWID tag provides software asset management and security tools with valuable information needed to automate the
		management of a software install across the software's deployment lifecycle. SWID tags support automation of 
		software inventory as part of a software asset management (SAM) process, assessment of software vulnerabilities 
		present on a computing device, detection of missing patches, targeting of configuration checklist assessments, 
		software integrity checking, installation and execution whitelists/blacklists, and other security and operational 
		use cases.
