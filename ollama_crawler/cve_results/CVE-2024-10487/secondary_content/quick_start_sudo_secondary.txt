Manage sudo privileges

Managing sudo on your agents allows you to control which
    system users have access to elevated privileges. This guide helps you get started
    managing sudo privileges across your nodes, using a module from the Puppet
Forge in conjunction with a simple module you write.
Before you begin
Before starting this
        walk-through, complete the previous exercises. 
Ensure you’ve already 
                    installed Puppet, and at least one  *nix agent. Also, log in as
                root or Administrator on your nodes.
Using this guide, you learn
        how to:


Install the saz-sudo module as the foundation for managing sudo
            privileges.


Write a module that contains a class called privileges to manage a resource
            that sets privileges for certain users.


Add classes from the privileges and sudo modules to your agents.




Note: You can add the sudo and privileges classes to as many agents as needed. For simplicity,
          this guide describes only one.



Start by installing the saz-sudo module. It's available on the Forge, and is one of many modules written by a member of the
            Puppet user community. You can learn more about the
          module at forge.puppet.com/saz/sudo. To install the saz-sudo module, run the following
          command on the primary server:

puppet module install saz-sudo

The resulting
            output is similar to
            this:Preparing to install into /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules …
Notice: Downloading from http://forgeapi.puppetlabs.com ...
    Notice: Installing -- do not interrupt ...
    /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules
    └── saz-sudo (v2.3.6)
          └── puppetlabs-stdlib (3.2.2) [/opt/puppet/share/puppet/modules]That’s
            it! You’ve installed the saz-sudo module.


Next, you'll create a module that contains
            the privileges class.
Like in the DNS exercise,
            this is a small module with just one class. You'll create the privileges module directory, its manifests subdirectory, and an
              init.pp manifest file
            that contains the privileges class. 


From the command line on the primary server, navigate to the
              modules directory: 

cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules



Create the module directory and its manifests
              directory: 

mkdir -p privileges/manifests



In the manifests directory, use your text
              editor to create the init.pp file, and edit it so it contains the following Puppet code:


class privileges {

   sudo::conf { 'admins':
   ensure  => present,
   content => '%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL',
   }

 }

The sudo::conf 'admins' line creates a sudoers rule that
                ensures that members of the admins group have the ability to run any command using
                sudo. This resource creates a configuration fragment file to define this rule
                  in /etc/sudoers.d/. It's called something like 10_admins.



Save and exit the file.
That’s it!
                You’ve created a module that contains a class that, after it's applied, ensures that
                your agents have the correct sudo privileges set for the root user and the admins and wheel
                groups.




Next, add the privileges and sudo classes to default nodes.


From the command line on the primary server, navigate to the
              main manifest: 

cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests



Open site.pp with your text editor and add the following Puppet code to the default node:


class { 'sudo': }
sudo::conf { 'web':
  content  => "web ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL",
}
class { 'privileges': }
sudo::conf { 'jargyle':
  priority => 60,
  content  => "jargyle ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL",
}

The sudo::conf ‘web’ line creates a sudoers rule to ensure that
                members of the web group can run any command using
                sudo. This resource creates a configuration fragment file to define this rule
                  in /etc/sudoers.d/.
The sudo::conf ‘jargyle’ line creates a sudoers
                rule to ensure that the user jargyle can run any command using sudo. This resource
                creates a configuration fragment to define this rule in /etc/sudoers.d/. It's called
                something like 60_jargyle.



Save and exit the file.


On your primary server, ensure that there are no errors: 

puppet parser validate site.pp

The parser
                returns nothing if there are no errors.


From the command line on your agent, run Puppet: puppet agent -t

That’s it! You have
                successfully applied sudo and privileges classes to nodes.


To confirm it worked, run the following command on an
              agent: 


sudo -l -U jargyle

The results resemble the following:
                 Matching Defaults entries for jargyle on this host:
!visiblepw, always_set_home, env_reset, env_keep="COLORS DISPLAY HOSTNAME HISTSIZE
INPUTRC KDEDIR LS_COLORS", env_keep+="MAIL PS1 PS2 QTDIR USERNAME LANG LC_ADDRESS
LC_CTYPE", env_keep+="LC_COLLATE LC_IDENTIFICATION LC_MEASUREMENT LC_MESSAGES",
env_keep+="LC_MONETARY LC_NAME LC_NUMERIC LC_PAPER LC_TELEPHONE", env_keep+="LC_TIME
LC_ALL LANGUAGE LINGUAS _XKB_CHARSET XAUTHORITY",
secure_path=/usr/local/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin

 User jargyle may run the following commands on this host:
(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
