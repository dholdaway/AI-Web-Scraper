Time-related data types
A Timespan defines the length of a duration of time, and a Timestamp defines a point in time. For example, “two
        hours” is a duration that can be represented as a Timespan, while “three o'clock in the afternoon UTC on 8 November, 2018” is a
        point in time that can be represented as a Timestamp. Both types can use nanosecond values if it is available on the
        platform.

The Timespan data
        type

A Timespan value represents a duration of time. The Timespan data type matches a specified range of durations and
        includes all values within the given range. The default represents a positive or negative infinite duration. A Timespan value can be specified with strings or
        numbers in various forms. The type takes up to two parameters. 
Parameters
The full signature for Timespan is:Timespan[ (<TIMESPAN START OR LENGTH>, (<TIMESPAN END>)) ]











Position
Parameter
Data type
Default value
Description




1
Timespan start or length

String, Float,
                                        Integer, or default


default (negative infinity in a span) 
If only one parameter is passed, it is the length of the
                                    timespan. If two parameters are passed, this is the start or
                                        from value in a time range. 


2
Timespan end

String, Float,
                                        Integer, or default


default (positive infinity) or
                                    none if only one value passed.
The end or to value in a time range.
                                



Timespan values are interpreted depending on their format: 

A String in the format D-HH:MM:SS represents a duration
                            of D days, HH hours,
                                MM minutes, and SS seconds. 


An Integer or Float represents a duration in seconds.

A Timespan defined as a range (two parameters) matches
                    any Timespan durations that can fit within that
                range. If either end of a range is defined
                as default (infinity), it is an open range,
                while any other range is a closed range. The range is inclusive.
In other words, Timespan[2] matches a duration of two
                seconds, but Timespan[0, 2] can match any
Timespan from zero to two seconds, inclusive.
The Timespan type is not enumerable.
For information about converting values of other types to Timespan
                using the new function, or for converting a
                    Timespan to a String using
                strftime, see the function reference documentation.
Examples:

Timespan[2]

Matches a Timespan value of 2 seconds.

Timespan[77.3]

Matches a Timespan value of 1 minute, 17
                            seconds, and 300 milliseconds (77.3 seconds).

Timespan['1-00:00:00', '2-00:00:00']

Matches a closed range of Timespan values
                            between 1 and 2 days.





The Timestamp data
      type

A Timestamp value represents a specific point in time. The Timestamp data type can be one single point
      or any point within a given range, depending on the number of specified parameters. Timestamp values that include a  default parameter represents an infinite range of
      either positive or negative Timestamps. A Timestamp value can be specified
      with strings or numbers in various forms.
Parameters
The full signature
            for Timestamp is:Timestamp[ (<TIMESTAMP VALUE>, (<RANGE LIMIT>)) ]The
            type takes up to two parameters, and defaults to an infinite range to the past and
            future. A Timestamp with one parameter represents a single
            point in time, while two parameters represent a range of Timestamps,
            with the first parameter being the from value and the second
            being the to value. 












Position
Parameter
Data type
Default value
Description




1
Timestamp value

String, Float,
                              Integer, or default


default (negative infinity in a range) 
Point in time if passed alone,
                           or from value in a range if passed with a
                           second parameter. 


2
Range limit

String, Float,
                              Integer, or default


default (positive infinity), or none if only
                           one value is passed 
The to value in a range. 


A  Timestamp that is defined as a single point in
            time (one parameter) matches exactly that point.
A Timestamp that is defined as a range (two parameters)
            matches any point in time within that range. If either end of a range is defined
               as default (infinity), it is an open range,
            while any other range is a closed range. The range is inclusive.
So, Timestamp['2000-01-01T00:00:00.000'] matches 0:00 UTC on 1
            January, 2000, while Timestamp['2000-01-01T00:00:00.000',
               '2001-01-01T00:00:00.000] matches Timestamp values
            from that point in time to a point in time one year later, inclusive.
Timestamp values are interpreted depending on their format.
For information about converting values of other types to Timestamp
            using the new function, or for converting a Timespan
            to a String using the strftime function, see the function reference documentation.
Examples: 

Timestamp['2000-01-01T00:00:00.000', default]

Matches an open range of Timestamps from the start
                     of the 21st century to an infinite point in the future. 

Timestamp['2012-10-10']

Matches the exact Timestamp 2012-10-10T00:00:00.0
                     UTC. 

Timestamp[default, 1433116800]

Matches an open range of Timestamps from an
                     infinite point in the past to 2015-06-01T00:00:00 UTC, here expressed as
                     seconds since the Unix epoch. 

Timestamp['2010-01-01', '2015-12-31T23:59:59.999999999']

Matches a closed range of Timestamps between the
                     start of 2010 and the end of 2015.
