Introduction to Development with NVD Data
		
				The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Program is a dictionary or glossary 
				of vulnerabilities that have been identified for specific code bases, such as software 
				applications or open libraries. A unique identifier known as the CVE ID allows 
				stakeholders a common means of discussing and researching a specific, unique exploit.  
				The Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) program fulfills a function similar to the CVE 
				program for IT products and platforms.  The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) 
				program combines CVE and CPE in a suite of tools to help automate vulnerability 
				management and evaluate compliance with federal information technology security 
				requirements.
			

				The NVD maintains the authoritative CPE dictionary, while the CVE Program is maintained 
				by the MITRE corporation. The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is tasked with analyzing 
				each CVE once it has been published to the CVE List.  
				NVD analysts use the reference information provided with the CVE and any publicly available information at 
				the time of analysis to associate Reference Tags, Common Vulnerability Scoring System 
				(CVSS) v3.1, CWE, and CPE Applicability statements.
			

				CVEs are typically available in the NVD within an hour of their publishing. Once a CVE is 
				in the NVD, analysts can begin the 
				analysis process. 
				The processing time can vary depending on the CVE, the information available, and the 
				quantity of CVEs published within a given time frame.  After analysis is complete, CVE 
				and CPE may be updated (modified).  If modification occurs, the NVD will 
				automatically refresh any associated CVE and CPE records.
