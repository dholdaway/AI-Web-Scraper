Autosigning certificate requests

Before Puppet agent nodes
        can retrieve their configuration catalogs, they require a signed certificate from the local
            Puppet certificate authority (CA). When using Puppet’s built-in CA instead of an external CA, agents submit
        a certificate signing request (CSR) to the CA to retrieve a signed certificate after it's
        available.
By default, these CSRs must be manually signed by an admin user, using
            either the puppetserver
                ca command or the Node requests page in the Puppet Enterprise
            console.
Alternatively, to speed up the process of bringing new agent nodes
            into the deployment, you can configure the CA to automatically sign certain CSRs.


CAUTION: Autosigning CSRs changes the nature of your
                deployment’s security, and you should understand the implications before configuring
                it. Each type of autosigning has its own security impact.



Disabling autosigning

By default, the autosign setting in the [server] section of the CA’s puppet.conf file is set
            to $confdir/autosign.conf. The basic autosigning functionality is enabled upon
        installation. 
Depending on your installation method, there might not be an allowlist
            at that location after the Puppet Server is running:


Open source Puppet: autosign.conf doesn’t exist
                        by default.
Monolithic Puppet Enterprise (PE)
                        installations: All required services run on one server, and autosign.conf exists on the primary server, but by default it's empty
                    because the primary server doesn’t need to add other servers to an allowlist.
Split PE installations: Services like PuppetDB can
                        run on different servers, the autosign.conf exists on the CA server and
                        contains an allowlist of other required hosts.


If the autosign.conf file is empty or doesn’t exist, the allowlist is
            effectively empty. The CA Puppet primary server doesn’t autosign
            any certificates until the the autosign setting’s path is configured, or until
            the default autosign.conf file is a non-executable allowlist file. This file must
            contain correctly formatted content or a custom policy executable that the Puppet user has permission to run.
To explicitly disable autosigning, set autosign = false in
                the [server] section of the CA Puppet
            primary server’s puppet.conf. This disables CA autosigning even if the autosign.conf file or a
            custom policy executable exists.
For more information about the autosign setting in puppet.conf, see the configuration reference.


Naïve autosigning

Naïve autosigning causes the CA to autosign all
      CSRs.
To enable naïve autosigning, set autosign = true in the [server] section of the CA Puppet primary server’s puppet.conf.


CAUTION: For security reasons, never use naïve
            autosigning in a production deployment. Naïve autosigning is suitable only for
            temporary test deployments that are incapable of serving catalogs containing sensitive
            information.



Basic autosigning (autosign.conf)

In basic autosigning, the CA uses a config file containing
        an allowlist of certificate names and domain name globs. When a CSR arrives, the requested
        certificate name is checked against the allowlist file. If the name is present, or covered
        by one of the domain name globs, the certificate is autosigned. If not, it's left for a
        manual review.
Enabling basic autosigning
The autosign.conf allowlist file’s location
                and contents are described in its documentation.

Puppet looks for autosign.conf at the path configured in the [autosign setting] within the [server] section of puppet.conf. The default path is $confdir/autosign.conf, and the default confdir path depends on your operating system. For more
                information, see the confdir documentation.

If the autosign.conf file pointed to by
                    the autosign setting is a file that
                the Puppet user can execute, Puppet instead attempts to run it as a custom policy
                executable, even if it contains a valid autosign.conf allowlist.


Note: In open source Puppet,
                        no autosign.conf file exists by
                    default. In Puppet Enterprise, the file exists by default
                    but might be empty. In both cases, the basic autosigning feature is technically
                    enabled by default but doesn’t autosign any certificates because the allowlist
                    is effectively empty. The CA Puppet primary
                        server therefore doesn’t autosign any certificates until the autosign.conf file contains a properly
                        formatted allowlist or is a custom policy executable that the Puppet user has permission to run, or until
                            the autosign setting is pointed at
                        an allowlist file with properly formatted content or a custom policy
                        executable that the Puppet user has
                        permission to run.



Security implications of basic autosigning
Basic autosigning is insecure because any host can provide any certname when
                requesting a certificate. Use it only when you fully trust any computer capable of
                connecting to the Puppet primary server.
With basic autosigning enabled, an attacker who guesses an unused certname allowed
                    by autosign.conf can obtain a signed
                agent certificate from the Puppet primary server. The
                attacker could then obtain a configuration catalog, which can contain sensitive
                information depending on your deployment’s Puppet
                code and node classification.



Policy-based autosigning

In policy-based autosigning, the CA runs an external
        policy executable every time it receives a CSR. This executable examines the CSR and tells
        the CA whether the certificate is approved for autosigning. If the executable approves, the
        certificate is autosigned; if not, it's left for manual review.
Enabling policy-based autosigning
To enable policy-based autosigning, set autosign =
                    <policy executable file> in the [server] section of the CA Puppet
                primary server’s puppet.conf.
The policy executable file must be executable by the same user as the Puppet primary server. If not, it is treated as
                a certname allowlist file.

Custom policy executables
A custom policy executable can be written in any programming language; it just has to
                be executable in a *nix-like environment. The Puppet primary server passes it the certname of the
                request (as a command line argument) and the PEM-encoded CSR (on stdin), and expects
                    a 0 (approved) or non-zero (rejected)
                exit code.
After it has the CSR, a policy executable can extract information from it and decide
                whether to approve the certificate for autosigning. This is useful when you are
                provisioning your nodes and are embedding additional information in the CSR.
If you aren’t embedding additional data, the CSR contains only the node’s certname
                and public key. This can still provide more flexibility and security
                    than autosign.conf, as the executable can
                do things like query your provisioning system, CMDB, or cloud provider to make sure
                a node with that name was recently added.

Security implications of policy-based autosigning
Depending on how you manage the information the policy executable is using,
                policy-based autosigning can be fast and extremely secure. 
For example:

If you embed a unique pre-shared key on each node you provision, and
                            provide your policy executable with a database of these keys, your
                            autosigning security is as good as your handling of the keys. As long as
                            it’s impractical for an attacker to acquire a PSK, it's impractical for
                            them to acquire a signed certificate.


If nodes running on a cloud service embed their instance UUIDs in their
                            CSRs, and your executable queries the cloud provider’s API to check that
                            a node's UUID exists in your account, your autosigning security is as
                            good as the security of the cloud provider’s API. If an attacker can
                            impersonate a legit user to the API and get a list of node UUIDs, or if
                            they can create a rogue node in your account, they can acquire a signed
                            certificate.



When designing your CSR data and signing policy, you must think things through
                carefully. If you can arrange reasonable end-to-end security for secret data on your
                nodes, you can configure a secure autosigning system.

Policy executable API
The API for policy executables is as follows.







Run environment



The executable runs one time for each incoming
                                                CSR.


It is executed by the Puppet primary server
                                                process and runs as the same user as the Puppet primary
                                                server.


The Puppet primary
                                                server process is blocked until the executable
                                                finishes running. We expect policy executables
                                                to finish in a timely fashion; if they do not, it’s
                                                possible for them to tie up all available Puppet primary server
                                                threads and deny service to other agents. If an
                                                executable needs to perform network requests or
                                                other potentially expensive operations, the author
                                                is in charge of implementing any necessary timeouts,
                                                possibly bailing and exiting non-zero in the event
                                                of failure. 





Arguments



The executable must allow a single command line
                                                argument. This argument is the Subject CN (certname)
                                                of the incoming CSR.


No other command line arguments should be
                                                provided.


The Puppet primary
                                                server should never fail to provide this
                                                argument.





Stdin



The executable receives the entirety of the incoming
                                                CSR on its stdin stream. The CSR is encoded in
                                                  pem format.


The stdin stream contains nothing but the complete
                                                CSR.


The Puppet primary
                                                server should never fail to provide the CSR on
                                                stdin.





Exit status



The executable must exit with a status
                                                  of 0 if
                                                the certificate should be autosigned; it must exit
                                                with a non-zero status if it should not be
                                                autosigned.


The Puppet primary
                                                server treats all non-zero exit statuses as
                                                equivalent.





Stdout and stderr



Anything the executable emits on stdout or stderr is
                                                copied to the Puppet Server
                                                log output at the debug log level. Puppet otherwise
                                                ignores the executable’s output; only the exit code
                                                is considered significant.
