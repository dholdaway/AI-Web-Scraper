Values, data types, and aliases

Most of the things you can do with the Puppet language
        involve some form of data. An individual piece of data is called
        a value, and every value has a data type, which determines
        what kind of information that value can contain and how you can interact with
        it.
Strings are the most common and useful data type, but you’ll also work with others,
            including numbers, arrays, and some Puppet-specific data
            types like resource references.
Note that once created, Puppet's values are immutable — they cannot be modified in any
            way.
For information on type conversion, see Typecasting. 
Literal data types as values
Although you’ll mostly interact with values of the various data
                types, Puppet also includes values like String that represent data
                types.
You can use these special values to examine a piece of data or enforce rules.
                Usually, they act like patterns, similar to a regular expression: given a value and
                a data type, you can test whether the value matches the data type,
                and then either adjust your code’s behavior accordingly, or raise an error if
                something has gone wrong.
The pages in this section provide details about using each of the data types as a
                value. For information about the syntax and behavior of literal data types, see
                    Data type syntax. For information about
                special abstract data types, which you can use to do more sophisticated or
                permissive type checking, see Abstract data
                    types.


Puppet's data types
See the following pages to learn more about the syntax, parameters, and usage for
                each of the data types.




Abstract data typesIf you’re using data types to match or restrict values and         need more flexibility than what the core data types (such as String or Array) allow, you can use one of the abstract data types to construct a data type that suits your needs and         matches the values you want.

ArraysArrays are ordered lists of values. Resource attributes     which accept multiple values (including the relationship metaparameters) generally expect those     values in an array. Many functions also take arrays, including the iteration     functions.

BinaryA  Binary object represents a sequence of bytes and         it can be created from a String in Base64 format, a verbatim String, or an Array containing byte values. A             Binary can also be created from a Hash containing the         value to convert to a Binary.

BooleansBooleans are one-bit values, representing true or false. The condition of an if statement expects an expression that resolves to a Boolean       value. All of Puppet's comparison operators resolve to Boolean       values, as do many functions.

Data type syntaxEach value in the Puppet         language has a data type, like “string.” There is also a set of values whose data type is “data type.” These values represent the other         data types. For example, the value String represents the data type of strings. The value         that represents the data type of these values             is Type.

DefaultPuppet’s default value acts like a keyword in a few     specific usages. Less commonly, it can also be used as a value.

Error data typeAn Error object contains a non-empty message. It can         also contain additional context about why the error occurred.  

HashesHashes map keys to values, maintaining the order of the       entries according to insertion order.

NumbersNumbers in the Puppet         language are normal integers and floating point numbers.

Regular expressionsA regular expression (sometimes shortened to “regex” or     “regexp”) is a pattern that can match some set of strings, and optionally capture parts of those     strings for further use.

Resource and class referencesResource references identify a specific Puppet resource by its type and title. Several     attributes, such as the relationship metaparameters, require resource     references.

Resource typesResource types are a special family of data     types that behave differently from other data types. They are subtypes of the fairly       abstract Resource data     type. Resource references are a useful subset of this data type family.

SensitiveSensitive types in the Puppet language are strings marked as sensitive. The value is displayed in plain text in the         catalog and manifest, but is redacted from logs and reports. Because the value is maintained         as plain text, use it only as an aid to ensure that sensitive values are not inadvertently         disclosed.

StringsStrings are unstructured text fragments of any length.         They’re a common and useful data type.

Time-related data typesA Timespan defines the length of a duration of time, and a Timestamp defines a point in time. For example, “two         hours” is a duration that can be represented as a Timespan, while “three o'clock in the afternoon UTC on 8 November, 2018” is a         point in time that can be represented as a Timestamp. Both types can use nanosecond values if it is available on the         platform.

UndefPuppet's undef value is roughly equivalent             to nil in Ruby. It represents the absence of a value. If             the strict_variables setting isn’t enabled, variables which have never been         declared have a value of undef.
