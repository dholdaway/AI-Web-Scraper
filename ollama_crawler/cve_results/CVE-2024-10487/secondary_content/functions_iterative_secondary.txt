Iterative functions

You can use iterative types to write efficient iterative functions, or to chain
    together the iterative functions built into Puppet.
Iterative functions include Iterable and Iterator types, as well as other types you can iterate over, such as
      arrays and hashes. For example, an Array[Integer] is also an
        Iterable[Integer].


Tip: Iterable and Iterator types are used internally by Puppet to
        efficiently chain the results of its built-in iterative functions. You can’t write iterative
        functions solely in the Puppet language. For help writing
        less complex functions in Puppet code, see Writing functions in Puppet.


Iterable and Iterator
        type design
The Iterable type represents all things an iterative
        function can iterate over. Before this type was introduced in Puppet 4.4, if you wanted to design working iterative
        functions, you'd have to write code that accommodated all relevant types, such as Array, Hash, Integer, and Type[Integer]. 
Signatures of iterative functions accept an Iterable type
        argument. This means that you no longer have to design iterative functions to check against
        every type. This behavior does not affect how the Puppet code
        that invokes these functions works, but does change the errors you see if you try to iterate
        over a value that does not have the Iterable type. 
The Iterator type, which is a subtype of Iterable, is a special algorithm-based Iterable not backed by a concrete data type. When asked to produce a value, an
          Iterator produces the next value from its input, and then
        either yields a transformation of this value, or takes its input and yields each value from
        a formula based on that value. For example, the step
        function produces consecutive values but does not need to first produce an array containing
        all of the values.

Writing iterative functions

Remember: You can’t write iterative functions solely in the Puppet language.
When writing iterative functions, use the Iterable type
        instead of the more specific, individual types. The Iterable
        type has a type parameter that describes the type that is yielded in each iteration. For
        example, an Array[Integer] is also an Iterable[Integer]. 
When writing a function that returns an Iterator, declare
        the return type as Iterable. This is the most flexible way
        to handle an Iterator.
For best practices on implementing iterative functions, examine existing iterative functions in Puppet
and read the Ruby documentation for the helper classes
        these functions use. See the implementations of each and
          map for functions that always produce a new result, and
          reverse_each and step for
        new iterative functions that return an Iterable when called
        without a block. 
For example, this is the Ruby code for the step function:

Puppet::Functions.create_function(:step) do
  dispatch :step do
    param 'Iterable', :iterable
    param 'Integer[1]', :step
  end

  dispatch :step_block do
    param 'Iterable', :iterable
    param 'Integer[1]', :step
    block_param 'Callable[1,1]', :block
  end

  def step(iterable, step)
    # produces an Iterable
    Puppet::Pops::Types::Iterable.asserted_iterable(self, iterable).step(step)
  end

  def step_block(iterable, step, &block)
    Puppet::Pops::Types::Iterable.asserted_iterable(self, iterable).step(step, &block)
    nil
  end
end


Efficiently chaining iterative functions
Iterative functions are often used in chains, where the result of one function is used as
        the next function’s parameter. A typical example is a map/reduce function, where values are first
        modified, and then an aggregate value is computed. For example, this use of reverse_each and reduce:

[1,2,3].reverse_each.reduce |$result, $x| { $result - $x }

The reverse_each function iterates over the Array to reverse the order of its values from [1,2,3] to [3,2,1]. The reduce function iterates over the Array, subtracting each value from the previous value. The $result is 0, because 3 - 2 - 1 =
        0. 
Iterable types allow functions like these to execute more efficiently in a chain of calls,
        because they eliminate each function’s need to create an intermediate copy of the mapped
        values in the appropriate type. In the above example, the mapped values would be the array
          [3,2,1] produced by the reverse_each function. The first time the reduce
        function is called, it receives the values 3 and 2 — the value 1 has not yet been
        computed. In the next iteration, reduce receives the value
          1, and the chain ends because there are no more values in
        the array. 

Limitations and workarounds
When you use it last in a chain, you can assign a value of Iterator[T] (where T is a data type) to a
        variable and pass it on. However, you cannot assign an Iterator to a parameter value. It's also not possible to call legacy 3.x
        functions with an Iterator.
If you assign an Iterator to a resource attribute, you get
        an error. This is because the Iterator type is a special
        algorithm-based Iterable that is not backed by a concrete
        data type. In addition, parameters in resources are serialized, and Puppet cannot serialize a temporary algorithmic result.
For example, if you used the following Puppet code:

notify { 'example1':
  message => [1,2,3].reverse_each,
}

You would recieve the following error:

Error while evaluating a '=>' expression, Use of an Iterator is not supported here

Puppet needs a concrete data type for serialization, but the
        result of [1,2,3].reverse_each is only a temporary Iterator value. To convert the Iterator-typed value to an Array, map the value. 
This example results in an array by chaining the map
        function:

notify { 'mapped_iterator':
  message => [1,2,3].reverse_each.map |$x| { $x },
}You can also use the splat operator * to convert the value into an array.

notify { 'mapped_iterator':
  message => *[1,2,3].reverse_each,
}Both of these examples result in a notice containing [3,2,1]. If you use * in a context where it also
        unfolds, the result is the same as unfolding an array: each value of the array becomes a
        separate value, which results in separate arguments in a function call.

          functions, reverse_each functions.
