https://cvefeed.io: Your Go-To Place for Finding Out About Security Feed and Intelligence..
I'm always on the lookout for the newest information on security problems. I've searched high and low, from Twitter to RSS feeds, but was surprised there wasn't a single place that had all the info I needed.
Example CVE detail page:
CVE-2024-21762
Example Product Security Index page.
https://cvefeed.io/vuln/product/1/zohocorpmanageengine_password_manager_pro/
Motivation: Why ?
Starting a new project on finding security weaknesses means I have to spend a lot of time looking up information about my 'target,' like past security issues and examples on GitHub.
There are plenty of great tools out there that you can run from your computer. However, most online platforms that offer what you need either ask for a subscription or are too focused on promoting their brand, which I get and respect.
But, as the industry leans more towards solutions for Managing Attack Surfaces (ASM) and Managing Vulnerabilities (VM), sources of information on vulnerabilities are also turning commercial. I made this website to give the latest info on vulnerabilities to people who are looking into security. It's just starting, but I plan to grow it into a comprehensive source of information for security researchers, testers, and analysts.
How can you help?

FAQ
Q:  Is it ever gonna be open-sourced ?
Yes I'll open-source the cvefeed.io once I believe it's more thn a beta.
Q:  How can I financially supporty the project ?
I haven't thought about this at all. I can say that monthly infra cost is around $150-200 right now, which I can handle it for a while.
