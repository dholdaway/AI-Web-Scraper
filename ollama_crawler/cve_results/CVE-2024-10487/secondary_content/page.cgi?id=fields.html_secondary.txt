This page describes the various fields that you see 
  on a bug.

The Status field indicates the 
      current state of a bug. Only certain status transitions
      are allowed.
The Resolution field indicates what
      happened to this bug.




Open Bugs




UNCONFIRMED
        

          This bug has recently been added to the database. 
          Nobody has confirmed that this bug is valid. Users
          who have the "canconfirm" permission set may confirm
          this bug, changing its state to 
          CONFIRMED. 
          Or, it may be directly resolved and marked
          RESOLVED.
        
CONFIRMED
        

          This bug is valid and has recently been filed.
          Bugs in this state become 
          IN_PROGRESS
          when somebody is working on them, or become resolved and marked
          RESOLVED.
        
IN_PROGRESS
        

          This bug is not yet resolved, but is assigned to the
          proper person who is working on the bug. From here,
          bugs can be given to another person and become
          CONFIRMED, or
          resolved and become 
          RESOLVED.
        



      No resolution yet. All bugs which are in one of
      these "open" states have no resolution set.
    


Closed Bugs




RESOLVED
        

          A resolution has been performed, and it is awaiting verification by
          QA. From here bugs are either reopened and given some
          open status, or are verified by an impacted user or QA and marked
          VERIFIED.
        
VERIFIED
        

          QA has looked at the bug and the resolution and
          agrees that the appropriate resolution has been taken. This is
          the final status for bugs.
        




FIXED
        

          A fix for this bug is checked into the tree and 
          tested.
        
INVALID
        

          The problem described is not a bug.
        
WONTFIX
        

          The problem described is a bug which will never be 
          fixed.
        
DUPLICATE
        

          The problem is a duplicate of an existing bug.
          When a bug is marked as a
          DUPLICATE,
          you will see which bug it is a duplicate of,
          next to the resolution.
        
WORKSFORME
        

          All attempts at reproducing this bug were futile, 
          and reading the code produces no clues as to why the described
          behavior would occur. If more information appears later,
          the bug can be reopened.
        
CANTFIX
        

          Fixing this bug is not possible, and the reasoning
          should be detailed by the closer. Generally speaking, fixing thebug might be technically unfeasible, require an
          extraordinary (unreasonable) amount of effort, be disallowed for
          legal/social reasons, or not within bounds of the current framework.
          If circumstances change later on that affect the justification, thebug can be reopened and reconsidered.
        
NEEDINFO
        

          Before investigation can proceed further, the reporter needs to
          provide more information. This often includes clarification of
          already posted details, adding missing log files, or running some
          tests to help debug the situation. Once the requested information
          has been provided, the bug should be re-opened. This
          status is frequently used when the expectation is the submitter
          has disappeared and won't follow up, or to help clear out open
          reports that still need triaging.
        
TEST-REQUEST
        

          The bug is thought to be fixed, but we would like
          someone who is affected to verify the fix. If the bug
          is not actually fixed, then the report should be reopened and more
          details posted (explaining why people believe the bug
          is not actually fixed).
        
UPSTREAM
        

          The requested bug is considered to be out of the purview
          of the distro and should be submitted/discussed directly with the
          respective upstream project. This could include a number of things
          such as changing default configuration options or behavior, adding
          new options or functionality, or deleting support for older systems.
        
OBSOLETE
        

          Due to a variety of reasons, the bug as reported is no
          longer relevant. It might apply to older versions of a package and
          the newer versions rewrote (implicitly fixing) the related code, or
          perhaps support was dropped entirely.
        
PKGREMOVED
        

          The bug is no longer relevant because the affected
          package was removed from the tree. However, it may become
          relevant again if the package is reintroduced.
