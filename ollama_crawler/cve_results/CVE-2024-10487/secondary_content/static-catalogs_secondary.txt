Static catalogs 

A static catalog includes additional metadata that identifies the desired
        state of a node’s file resources that have source attributes pointing to
            puppet:/// locations. This metadata can refer to a specific version of
        the file, rather than the latest version, and can confirm that the agent is applying the
        appropriate version of the file resource for the catalog. As most of the metadata is
        provided in the catalog, Puppet agents make fewer requests to
        the primary server.
When to use static catalogs
When a primary server compiles a non-static catalog, the catalog does not specify a
                particular version of its file resources. When the agent applies the catalog, it
                always retrieves the latest version of that file resource, or uses a previously
                retrieved version if it matches the latest version’s contents. Note that this
                potential problem affects file resources that use the source attribute. File
                resources that use the content attribute are not affected, and their behavior
                does not change in static catalogs.
When a Puppet manifest depends on a file whose
                contents change more frequently than the Puppet agent
                receives new catalogs — for example, if the agent is caching catalogs or cannot
                reach a primary server over the network — a node might apply a version of the
                referenced file that does not match the instructions in the catalog.
As a result, the agent’s Puppet runs might produce
                different results each time the agent applies the same catalog. This can cause
                problems because Puppet expects a catalog to produce
                the same results each time it is applied, regardless of any code or file content
                updates on the primary server.
Additionally, each time a Puppet agent applies a
                non-static cached catalog that contains file resources sourced from
                    puppet:/// locations, the agent requests file metadata from the
                primary server, even though nothing changed in the cached catalog. This causes the
                primary server to perform unnecessary resource-intensive checksum calculations for
                each such file resource.
Static catalogs avoid these problems by including metadata that refers to a specific
                version of the resource’s file. This prevents a newer version from being incorrectly
                applied, and avoids having the agent request the metadata on each Puppet run.
This type of catalog is called static because it contains all of the
                information that an agent needs to determine whether the node’s configuration
                matches the instructions and static state of file resources at the point in time
                when the catalog was compiled.

Static catalog features
A static catalog includes file metadata in its own section and associates it with the
                catalog's file resources. 
In a non-static catalog, the Puppet agent requests
                metadata and content for the file from Puppet Server. The
                server generates a checksum for the file and provides that file as it currently
                exists on the primary server.
With static catalogs enabled, the primary server generates metadata for each file
                resource sourced from a puppet:/// location and adds it to the
                static catalog, and adds a code_id to the catalog that associates
                such file resources with the version of their files as they exist at compilation
                time. For example: 

file { '/etc/application/config.conf':
  ensure => file,
  source => 'puppet:///modules/module_name/config.conf'
}

Inlined metadata is part of a FileMetadata object in the static
                catalog that is divided into two new sections: metadata for
                metadata associated with individual files, and recursive_metadata
                for metadata associated with many files. To use the appropriate version of the file
                content for the catalog, Puppet Server also adds a
                    code_id parameter to the catalog. The value of
                    code_id is a unique string that Puppet Server uses to retrieve the version of file
                resources in an environment at the time when the catalog was compiled.
When applying a file resource from a static catalog, an agent first checks the
                catalog for that file’s metadata. If it finds some, Puppet uses the metadata to call the
                    static_file_content API endpoint on Puppet Server and retrieves the file’s contents, also
                called the code_content. If the catalog does not contain metadata
                for the resource, Puppet requests the file resource’s
                metadata from the primary server, compares it to the local file if it exists, and
                requests the resource’s file from the primary server in its current state — if the
                local file doesn’t exist or differs from the primary server's version.

Configuring code_id and the static_file_content
                endpoint
When requesting the file’s content via the static catalog’s metadata, the Puppet agent passes the file’s path, the catalog’s
                    code_id, and the requested environment to Puppet Server's static_file_content API
                endpoint. The endpoint returns the appropriate version of the file’s contents as the
                    code_content.
If static catalogs are enabled but Puppet Server's static
                catalog settings are not configured, the code_id parameter defaults
                to a null value and the agent uses the file_content API endpoint,
                which always returns the latest content. To populate the code_id
                with a more useful identifier and have the agent use the
                    static_file_content endpoint to retrieve a specific version of
                the file’s content, you must specify scripts or commands that provide Puppet with the appropriate results.
Puppet Server locates these commands using the
                    code-id-command and code-content-command
                settings in the puppetserver.conf file. Puppet Server runs the code-id-command
                each time it compiles a static catalog, and it runs the
                    code-content-command each time an agent requests file contents
                from the static_file_content endpoint.
The Puppet Server process must be able to execute these
                scripts. Puppet Server also validates their output and
                checks their exit codes. Environment names can contain only alphanumeric characters
                and underscores (_). The code_id can contain only
                alphanumeric characters, dashes (-), underscores
                    (_), semicolons (;), and colons
                    (:). If either command returns a non-zero exit code, Puppet Server logs an error and returns the error message
                and a 500 response code to the API request.
Puppet Server validates the standard output of each of these
                scripts, and if the output’s acceptable, it adds the results to the catalog as their
                respective parameters’ values. You can use any versioning or synchronization tools,
                as long as you write scripts that produce a valid string for the
                    code_id and code content using the catalog’s
                    code_id and file’s environment.
The following examples demonstrate how Puppet Server passes
                arguments to the code-id-command and
                    code-content-command scripts and how Puppet Server uses the results to return a specific version
                of a file resource.
For files in an environment managed by Git, you would use something like the
                following code-id-command script, with the environment name passed
                in as the first command-line argument:#!/bin/bash
set -e
if [[ -z "$1" ]]; then
  echo Expected an environment >&2
  exit 1
fi
cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/"$1" && git rev-parse HEAD

As long as the script’s exit code is zero, Puppet Server
                uses the script’s standard output as the catalog’s code_id.
With a code-content-command script, Puppet Server passes the environment name as the first
                command-line argument, the code_id as the second argument, and the
                path to the file resource from its content_uri as the third
                argument:#!/bin/bash
set -e
if [[ $# < 3 ]]; then
  echo Expected environment, code-id, file-path >&2
  exit 1
fi
cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/"$1" && git show "$2":"$3"

The script’s standard output becomes the file’s code_content,
                provided the script returns a non-zero exit code.

Enabling or disabling static catalogs
The global static_catalogs setting is enabled by default. However,
                the default configuration does not include the code-id-command and
                    code-content-command scripts or settings needed to produce
                static catalogs, and even when configured to produce static catalogs Puppet Server does not inline metadata for all types of
                file resources.
Note that Puppet Server does not produce static catalogs for
                an agent under the following circumstances:

If the static_catalogs setting is false in:
The Puppet Server’s
                                puppet.conf file.
The environment.conf file for the environment under
                            which the agent is requesting a catalog.
The agent’s puppet.conf file.


If the Server’s code-id-command and
                        code-content-command settings and scripts are not
                    configured, or if the code-id-command returns an empty
                    string.

Additionally, Puppet Server only inlines metadata for file
                resources if all of the following conditions are true:

It contains a source parameter with a Puppet URI, such as source =>
                        'puppet:///path/to/file'.
It contains a source parameter that uses the built-in
                        modules mount point.
The file it sources is inside the following glob, relative to the environment’s
                    root directory: */*/files/**. For example, Puppet Server inlines metadata into static catalogs for
                    file resources sourcing module files located by default in
                        /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/<ENVIRONMENT>/modules/<MODULE
                        NAME>/files/**.
