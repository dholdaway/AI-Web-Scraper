Numbers

Numbers in the Puppet
        language are normal integers and floating point numbers.
You can work with numbers using arithmetic
                operators.
Numbers are written without quotation marks, and can consist only
                of:
Digits.
An optional negative sign (-). This is
                        actually the unary negation operator rather than part of the number.
                        Explicit positive signs (+) aren’t allowed.
An optional decimal point, which
                        results in a floating point value.
An optional e or E for scientific notation of
                        floating point values.
An 0 prefix for octal base, or
                            0x or
                            0X
                        prefix hexidecimal base.


Integers
Integers are numbers without decimal points.
If you divide two integers, the result is not a float. Instead, Puppet truncates the remainder. For
                example:$my_number = 2 / 3    # evaluates to 0
$your_number = 5 / 3  # evaluates to 1


Floating point numbers
Floating point numbers (“floats”) are numbers that include a fractional value after a
                decimal point, including a fractional value of zero, as in 2.0.
If an expression includes both integer and float values, the result is a
                float:$some_number = 8 * -7.992           # evaluates to -63.936
$another_number = $some_number / 4  # evaluates to -15.984Floating point
                numbers between -1 and 1 cannot start with a bare decimal point. They must have a
                zero before the decimal
                point:$product = 8 * .12 # syntax error
$product = 8 * 0.12 # OK

You can express floating point numbers in scientific notation: append e or E, plus an exponent, and the preceding number is multiplied by 10 to
                the power of that exponent. Numbers in scientific notation are always
                floats:$product = 8 * 3e5  # evaluates to 2400000.0


Octal and hexadecimal integers
Integer values can be expressed in decimal notation (base 10), octal notation (base
                8), and hexadecimal notation (base 16).
Decimal (base 10) integers (other than 0) must not
                start with a 0. 
Octal (base 8) integers have a prefix of 0 (zero),
                followed by octal digits 0 to 7.
Hexadecimal (base 16) integers have a prefix of 0x or 0X, followed by hexadecimal
                digits 0 to 9,
                    a to f, or
                    A to F.
Floats can't be expressed in octal or hexadecimal.
Examples:# octal
$value = 0777   # evaluates to decimal 511
$value = 0789   # Error, invalid octal
$value = 0777.3 # Error, invalid octal

# hexadecimal
$value = 0x777 # evaluates to decimal 1911
$value = 0xdef # evaluates to decimal 3567
$value = 0Xdef # same as above
$value = 0xDEF # same as above
$value = 0xLMN # Error, invalid hex




Converting numbers to strings

Numbers are automatically converted to strings when
        interpolated into a string. The automatic conversion uses decimal (base 10)
        notation.
You can also cast a number into a string
                directly, by declaring a new String object.
Examples:$from_integer = String(342)
$from_float   = String(3.14159)

To convert numbers to non-decimal
            string representations, use the sprintf function.


Converting strings to numbers

Arithmetic operators in an expression automatically convert strings to numbers, but
        in all other contexts (for example, resource attributes or function arguments), Puppet won’t automatically convert strings to
        numbers.
To convert a string to a number, cast the type by declaring a new Numeric object.
Examples:$integer_var = Integer('342')
$float_var   = Float('3.14159')
$numeric_var = Numeric('5280')

For more information about casting, see the function documentation for converting to Integer and converting
                    to Float.
To extract numbers from strings, use the
                        scanf function. This function handles
                surrounding non-numerical text.


The Integer data type

The data type of integers is Integer. By default, Integer matches whole numbers
            of any size, within the limits of available memory. You can use parameters to restrict
            which values Integer matches.
Parameters
The full signature for Integer is:Integer[<MIN VALUE>, <MAX VALUE>]These
                        parameters are optional. They must be listed in order; if you need to
                        specify a later parameter, you must also specify values for any prior ones. 










Position
Parameter
Data type
Default
Description




1
Minimum value
Integer
negative infinity
The minimum value for the integer. This
                                                  parameter accepts the special value default, which uses its
                                                  default value. 


2
Maximum value
Integer
infinity
The maximum value for the integer. This
                                                  parameter accepts the special value default, which uses its
                                                  default value. 




Practically speaking, the integer size limit is the range of a 64-bit signed
                        integer (−9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807), which is
                        the maximum size that can roundtrip safely between the components in the Puppet ecosystem.
Examples: 
Integer
Matches any integer.
Integer[0]
Matches any integer greater than or equal to 0.
Integer[default, 0]
Matches any integer less than or equal to 0.
Integer[2, 8]
Matches any integer from 2 to 8, inclusive.





The Float data type

The data type of floating point numbers is Float. By default, Float matches floating point numbers
      within the limitations of Ruby's Float class. Practically
      speaking, this means a 64-bit double precision floating point value. You can use parameters to
      restrict which values Float matches.
Parameters
The full signature for Float is:Float[<MIN VALUE>, <MAX VALUE>]These
            parameters are optional. They must be listed in order; if you need to specify a later
            parameter, you must also specify values for any prior ones. 










Position
Parameter
Data type
Default
Description




1
Minimum value
Float
negative infinity
The minimum value for the float. This parameter accepts the special
                              value default, which uses its
                           default value. 


2
Maximum value
Float
infinity
The maximum value for the float. This parameter accepts the special
                              value default, which uses its
                           default value. 




Examples: 

Float

Matches any floating point number.

Float[1.6]

Matches any floating point number greater than or equal to 1.6.

Float[1.6, 3.501]

Matches any floating point number from 1.6 to 3.501, inclusive.


For more information about Float see Ruby's Float class
               docs.



The Numeric data type

The data type of all numbers, both integer and
        floating point, is Numeric. It matches any integer or floating point number, and takes no
        parameters.

Numeric is equivalent to Variant[Integer, Float].
                If you need to set size limits but still accept both integers and floats, you can
                use the abstract type Variant to construct an appropriate data type. For
                example:
                Variant[Integer[-3,3], Float[-3.0,3.0]]
