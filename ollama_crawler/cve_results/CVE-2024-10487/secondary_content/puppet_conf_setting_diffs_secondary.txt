Differing behavior in puppet.conf
Puppet Server honors almost all settings in puppet.conf and should pick them
up automatically. For more complete information on puppet.conf settings, see our Configuration Reference page.
Settings that differ

autoflush
Puppet Server does not use this setting. For more information on the logging implementation
for Puppet Server, see the logging configuration section.bindaddress
Puppet Server does not use this setting. To set the address on which the primary server
listens, use either host (unencrypted) or ssl-host (SSL encrypted) in the
webserver.conf file.ca
Puppet Server does not use this setting. Instead, Puppet Server acts as a
certificate authority based on the certificate authority service configuration
in the ca.cfg file. See Service Bootstrapping for more details.ca_ttl
Puppet Server enforces a max ttl of 50 standard years (up to 1576800000 seconds).cacert
If you enable Puppet Server's certificate authority service, it uses the cacert
setting in puppet.conf to determine the location of the CA certificate for such
tasks as generating the CA certificate or using the CA to sign client certificates.
This is true regardless of the configuration of the ssl- settings in
webserver.conf.cacrl

If you define ssl-cert, ssl-key, ssl-ca-cert, or ssl-crl-path in
webserver.conf, Puppet Server uses the
file at ssl-crl-path as the CRL for authenticating clients via SSL. If at least
one of the ssl- settings in webserver.conf is set but ssl-crl-path is not set,
Puppet Server will not use a CRL to validate clients via SSL.
If none of the ssl- settings in webserver.conf are set, Puppet Server uses
the CRL file defined for the hostcrl setting---and not the file defined for
the cacrl setting--in puppet.conf. At start time, Puppet Server copies the
file for the cacrl setting, if one exists, over to the location in the
hostcrl setting.
Any CRL file updates from the Puppet Server certificate authority---such as
revocations performed via the certificate_status HTTP endpoint---use the cacrl
setting in puppet.conf to determine the location of the CRL. This is true
regardless of the ssl- settings in webserver.conf.
capass
Puppet Server does not use this setting. Puppet Server's certificate authority
does not create a capass password file when the CA certificate and key are
generated.caprivatedir
Puppet Server does not use this setting. Puppet Server's certificate authority
does not create this directory.daemonize
Puppet Server does not use this setting.hostcert

If you define ssl-cert, ssl-key, ssl-ca-cert, or ssl-crl-path in
webserver.conf, Puppet Server presents the file at ssl-cert to clients as the server certificate via
SSL.
If at least one of the ssl- settings in webserver.conf is set but
ssl-cert is not set, Puppet Server gives an error and shuts down at
startup. If none of the ssl- settings in webserver.conf are set, Puppet Server uses the file for the hostcert setting in puppet.conf as the server
certificate during SSL negotiation.
Regardless of the configuration of the ssl- "webserver.conf" settings, Puppet
Server's certificate authority service, if enabled, uses the hostcert
"puppet.conf" setting, and not the ssl-cert setting, to determine the
location of the server host certificate to generate.
hostcrl

If you define ssl-cert, ssl-key, ssl-ca-cert, or ssl-crl-path in
webserver.conf, Puppet Server uses the
file at ssl-crl-path as the CRL for authenticating clients via SSL. If at least
one of the ssl- settings in webserver.conf is set but ssl-crl-path is not set,
Puppet Server will not use a CRL to validate clients via SSL.
If none of the ssl- settings in webserver.conf are set, Puppet Server uses
the CRL file defined for the hostcrl setting---and not the file defined for
the cacrl setting--in puppet.conf. At start time, Puppet Server copies the
file for the cacrl setting, if one exists, over to the location in the
hostcrl setting.
Any CRL file updates from the Puppet Server certificate authority---such as
revocations performed via the certificate_status HTTP endpoint---use the cacrl
setting in puppet.conf to determine the location of the CRL. This is true
regardless of the ssl- settings in webserver.conf.
hostprivkey

If you define ssl-cert, ssl-key, ssl-ca-cert, or ssl-crl-path in
webserver.conf, Puppet Server uses the file at ssl-key as the server private key during SSL transactions.
If at least one of the ssl- settings in webserver.conf is set but ssl-key
is not, Puppet Server gives an error and shuts down at startup. If none of
the ssl- settings in webserver.conf are set, Puppet Server uses the file for
the hostprivkey setting in puppet.conf as the server private key during SSL
negotiation.
If you enable the Puppet Server certificate authority service, Puppet Server uses the hostprivkey setting in puppet.conf to determine the location of the server host private key to generate. This is true regardless of the configuration of the ssl- settings in webserver.conf.
http_debug
Puppet Server does not use this setting. Debugging for HTTP client code in
Puppet Server is controlled through Puppet Server's common logging mechanism.
For more information on the logging implementation for Puppet Server, see the
logging configuration section.keylength
Puppet Server does not currently use this setting. Puppet Server's certificate
authority generates 4096-bit keys in conjunction with any SSL certificates that
it generates.localcacert

If you define ssl-cert, ssl-key, ssl-ca-cert, and/or ssl-crl-path in
webserver.conf, Puppet Server uses the
file at ssl-ca-cert as the CA cert store for authenticating clients via SSL.
If at least one of the ssl- settings in webserver.conf
is set but ssl-ca-cert is not set, Puppet Server gives an error
and shuts down at startup. If none of the ssl- settings in webserver.conf is
set, Puppet Server uses the CA file defined for the localcacert setting in
puppet.conf for SSL authentication.
logdir
Puppet Server does not use this setting. For more information on the logging
implementation for Puppet Server, see the logging configuration section.masterhttplog
Puppet Server does not use this setting. You can configure a web server access log via the access-log-config setting in the webserver.conf file.masterlog
Puppet Server does not use this setting. For more information on the logging
implementation for Puppet Server, see the logging configuration section.masterport
Puppet Server does not use this setting. To set the port on which the primary server listens,
set the port (unencrypted) or ssl-port (SSL encrypted) setting in the
webserver.conf file.puppetdlog
Puppet Server does not use this setting. For more information on the logging
implementation for Puppet Server, see the logging configuration section.rails_loglevel
Puppet Server does not use this setting.railslog
Puppet Server does not use this setting.ssl_client_header
Puppet Server honors this setting only if the allow-header-cert-info
setting in the server.conf file is set to 'true'. For more information on
this setting, see the documentation on external SSL termination.ssl_client_verify_header
Puppet Server honors this setting only if the allow-header-cert-info
setting in the server.conf file is set to true. For more information on
this setting, see the documentation on external SSL termination.ssl_server_ca_auth
Puppet Server does not use this setting. It only considers the ssl-ca-cert
setting from the webserver.conf file and the cacert setting from the
puppet.conf file. See cacert for more information.syslogfacility
Puppet Server does not use this setting.user
Puppet Server does not use this setting.HttpPool-Related Server Settings

configtimeout
Puppet Server does not currently consider this setting when making HTTP requests. This pertains, for example, to any requests that the primary server would make to the reporturl for the http report processor.http_proxy_host
Puppet Server does not currently consider this setting when making HTTP requests. This pertains, for example, to any requests that the primary server would make to the reporturl for the http report processor.http_proxy_port
Puppet Server does not currently consider this setting when making HTTP requests. This pertains, for example, to any requests that the primary server would make to the reporturl for the http report processor.Overriding Puppet settings in Puppet Server

Currently, the jruby-puppet section of your puppetserver.conf file contains five settings
(master-conf-dir, master-code-dir, master-var-dir, master-run-dir, and master-log-dir) that allow you to override settings set in
your puppet.conf file. On installation, these five settings will be set to the proper default values.
While you are free to change these settings at will, please note that any changes made to the master-conf-dir and master-code-dir settings
absolutely MUST be made to the corresponding Puppet settings (confdir and codedir) as well to ensure that Puppet Server and the Puppet
cli tools (such as puppetserver ca and puppet module) use the same directories. The master-conf-dir and master-code-dir
settings apply to Puppet Server only, and will be ignored by the ruby code that runs when the Puppet CLI tools are run.
For example, say you have the codedir setting left unset in your puppet.conf file, and you change the master-code-dir setting to
/etc/my-puppet-code-dir. In this case, Puppet Server will read code from /etc/my-puppet-code-dir, but the puppet module tool will
think that your code is stored in /etc/puppetlabs/code.
While it is not as critical to keep master-var-dir, master-run-dir, and master-log-dir in sync with the vardir, rundir, and logdir
Puppet settings, please note that this applies to these settings as well.
Also, please note that these configuration differences also apply to the interpolation of the confdir, codedir, vardir, rundir, and logdir
settings in your puppet.conf file. So, take the above example, wherein you set master-code-dir to /etc/my-puppet-code-dir. Because the
basemodulepath setting is by default $codedir/modules:/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/modules, then Puppet Server would use
/etc/my-puppet-code-dir/modules:/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/modules for the value of the basemodulepath setting, whereas the puppet module tool would use
/etc/puppetlabs/code/modules:/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/modules for the value of the basemodulepath setting.
