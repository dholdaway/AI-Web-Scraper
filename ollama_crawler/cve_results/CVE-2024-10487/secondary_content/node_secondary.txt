Man Page: puppet node
NOTE: This page was generated from the Puppet source code on 2022-02-07 10:05:17 -0800
NAME
puppet-node - View and manage node definitions.SYNOPSIS
puppet node action [--terminus _TERMINUS]DESCRIPTION
This subcommand interacts with node objects, which are used by Puppet to
build a catalog. A node object consists of the node's facts,
environment, node parameters (exposed in the parser as top-scope
variables), and classes.OPTIONS

Note that any setting that's valid in the configuration file is also a
valid long argument, although it may or may not be relevant to the
present action. For example, server and run_mode are valid
settings, so you can specify --server <servername>, or
--run_mode <runmode> as an argument.
See the configuration file documentation at
https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/configuration.html for the full
list of acceptable parameters. A commented list of all configuration
options can also be generated by running puppet with --genconfig.

--render-as FORMAT
The format in which to render output. The most common formats are
json, s (string), yaml, and console, but other
options such as dot are sometimes available.
--verbose
Whether to log verbosely.
--debug
Whether to log debug information.
--extra HASH
A terminus can take additional arguments to refine the operation,
which are passed as an arbitrary hash to the back-end. Anything
passed as the extra value is just send direct to the back-end.
--terminus _TERMINUS

Indirector faces expose indirected subsystems of Puppet. These
subsystems are each able to retrieve and alter a specific type of
data (with the familiar actions of find, search, save,
and destroy) from an arbitrary number of pluggable backends. In
Puppet parlance, these backends are called terminuses.
Almost all indirected subsystems have a rest terminus that
interacts with the puppet master's data. Most of them have
additional terminuses for various local data models, which are in
turn used by the indirected subsystem on the puppet master whenever
it receives a remote request.
The terminus for an action is often determined by context, but
occasionally needs to be set explicitly. See the "Notes" section
of this face's manpage for more details.


ACTIONS


clean - Clean up signed certs, cached facts, node objects, and reports for a node stored by the puppetmaster

SYNOPSIS
puppet node clean [--terminus _TERMINUS] host1 [host2
...]
DESCRIPTION
Cleans up the following information a puppet master knows about a
node:
Signed certificates - ($vardir/ssl/ca/signed/node.domain.pem)
Cached facts - ($vardir/yaml/facts/node.domain.yaml)
Cached node objects - ($vardir/yaml/node/node.domain.yaml)
Reports - ($vardir/reports/node.domain)
NOTE: this action now cleans up certs via Puppet Server's CA API. A
running server is required for certs to be cleaned.


find - Retrieve a node object.

SYNOPSIS
puppet node find [--terminus _TERMINUS] host
DESCRIPTION
Retrieve a node object.
RETURNS
A hash containing the node's classes, environment,
expiration, name, parameters (its facts, combined with
any ENC-set parameters), and time. When used from the Ruby API:
a Puppet::Node object.
RENDERING ISSUES: Rendering as string and json are currently broken;
node objects can only be rendered as yaml.


info - Print the default terminus class for this face.

SYNOPSIS
puppet node info [--terminus _TERMINUS]
DESCRIPTION
Prints the default terminus class for this subcommand. Note that
different run modes may have different default termini; when in
doubt, specify the run mode with the '--run_mode' option.

EXAMPLES

find
Retrieve an "empty" (no classes, no ENC-imposed parameters, and an
environment of "production") node:
$ puppet node find somenode.puppetlabs.lan --terminus plain
--render-as yaml
Retrieve a node using the Puppet Server's configured ENC:
$ puppet node find somenode.puppetlabs.lan --terminus exec --run_mode
server --render-as yaml
Retrieve the same node from the Puppet Server:
$ puppet node find somenode.puppetlabs.lan --terminus rest
--render-as yaml
NOTES

This subcommand is an indirector face, which exposes find,
search, save, and destroy actions for an indirected
subsystem of Puppet. Valid termini for this face include:

exec
json
memory
msgpack
plain
rest
store_configs
yaml
