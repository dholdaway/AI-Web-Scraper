Man Page: puppet module
NOTE: This page was generated from the Puppet source code on 2022-02-07 10:05:17 -0800
NAME
puppet-module - Creates, installs and searches for modules on the
Puppet Forge.SYNOPSIS
puppet module action [--environment production ] [--modulepath ]DESCRIPTION
This subcommand can find, install, and manage modules from the Puppet
Forge, a repository of user-contributed Puppet code. It can also
generate empty modules, and prepare locally developed modules for
release on the Forge.OPTIONS

Note that any setting that's valid in the configuration file is also a
valid long argument, although it may or may not be relevant to the
present action. For example, server and run_mode are valid
settings, so you can specify --server <servername>, or
--run_mode <runmode> as an argument.
See the configuration file documentation at
https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/configuration.html for the full
list of acceptable parameters. A commented list of all configuration
options can also be generated by running puppet with --genconfig.

--render-as FORMAT
The format in which to render output. The most common formats are
json, s (string), yaml, and console, but other
options such as dot are sometimes available.
--verbose
Whether to log verbosely.
--debug
Whether to log debug information.
--environment production

The environment in which Puppet is running. For clients, such as
puppet agent, this determines the environment itself, which
Puppet uses to find modules and much more. For servers, such as
puppet server, this provides the default environment for nodes
that Puppet knows nothing about.
When defining an environment in the [agent] section, this
refers to the environment that the agent requests from the primary
server. The environment doesn't have to exist on the local
filesystem because the agent fetches it from the primary server.
This definition is used when running puppet agent.
When defined in the [user] section, the environment refers to
the path that Puppet uses to search for code and modules related to
its execution. This requires the environment to exist locally on the
filesystem where puppet is being executed. Puppet subcommands,
including puppet module and puppet apply, use this
definition.
Given that the context and effects vary depending on the config
section
https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/config_file_main.html##config-sections    in which the environment setting is defined, do not set it
globally.

--modulepath

The search path for modules, as a list of directories separated by
the system path separator character. (The POSIX path separator is
':', and the Windows path separator is ';'.)
Setting a global value for modulepath in puppet.conf is not
allowed (but it can be overridden from the commandline). Please use
directory environments instead. If you need to use something other
than the default modulepath of <ACTIVE ENVIRONMENT'S MODULES
DIR>:$basemodulepath, you can set modulepath in
environment.conf. For more info, see
https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/environments_about.html


ACTIONS


changes - Show modified files of an installed module.

SYNOPSIS
puppet module changes path
DESCRIPTION
Shows any files in a module that have been modified since it was
installed. This action compares the files on disk to the md5
checksums included in the module's checksums.json or, if that is
missing, in metadata.json.
RETURNS
Array of strings representing paths of modified files.


install - Install a module from the Puppet Forge or a release archive.

SYNOPSIS
puppet module install [--force | -f] [--target-dir DIR | -i
DIR] [--ignore-dependencies] [--version VER | -v VER] name
DESCRIPTION
Installs a module from the Puppet Forge or from a release archive
file. Note: Module install uses MD5 checksums, which are prohibited
on FIPS enabled systems.
The specified module will be installed into the directory specified
with the --target-dir option, which defaults to the first
directory in the modulepath.
OPTIONS --force | -f - Force overwrite of existing module,
if any. Implies --ignore-dependencies.
--ignore-dependencies - Do not attempt to install dependencies.
Implied by --force.
--target-dir DIR | -i DIR - The directory into which modules
are installed; defaults to the first directory in the modulepath.
Specifying this option will change the installation directory, and
will use the existing modulepath when checking for dependencies. If
you wish to check a different set of directories for dependencies,
you must also use the --environment or --modulepath
options.
--version VER | -v VER - Module version to install; can be an
exact version or a requirement string, eg '>= 1.0.3'. Defaults to
latest version.
RETURNS
Pathname object representing the path to the installed module.


list - List installed modules

SYNOPSIS
puppet module list [--tree]
DESCRIPTION
Lists the installed puppet modules. By default, this action scans
the modulepath from puppet.conf's [main] block; use the
--modulepath option to change which directories are scanned.
The output of this action includes information from the module's
metadata, including version numbers and unmet module dependencies.
OPTIONS --tree - Whether to show dependencies as a tree view
RETURNS
hash of paths to module objects


uninstall - Uninstall a puppet module.

SYNOPSIS
puppet module uninstall [--force | -f] [--ignore-changes |
-c] [--version=] name
DESCRIPTION
Uninstalls a puppet module from the modulepath (or a specific target
directory). Note: Module uninstall uses MD5 checksums, which are
prohibited on FIPS enabled systems.
OPTIONS --force | -f - Force the uninstall of an installed
module even if there are local changes or the possibility of causing
broken dependencies.
--ignore-changes | -c - Uninstall an installed module even if
there are local changes to it. (Implied by --force.)
--version= - The version of the module to uninstall. When using
this option, a module matching the specified version must be
installed or else an error is raised.
RETURNS
Hash of module objects representing uninstalled modules and related
errors.


upgrade - Upgrade a puppet module.

SYNOPSIS
puppet module upgrade [--force | -f] [--ignore-dependencies]
[--ignore-changes | -c] [--version=] name
DESCRIPTION
Upgrades a puppet module. Note: Module upgrade uses MD5 checksums,
which are prohibited on FIPS enabled systems.
OPTIONS --force | -f - Force the upgrade of an installed
module even if there are local changes or the possibility of causing
broken dependencies. Implies --ignore-dependencies.
--ignore-changes | -c - Upgrade an installed module even if
there are local changes to it. (Implied by --force.)
--ignore-dependencies - Do not attempt to install dependencies.
Implied by --force.
--version= - The version of the module to upgrade to.
RETURNS
Hash
