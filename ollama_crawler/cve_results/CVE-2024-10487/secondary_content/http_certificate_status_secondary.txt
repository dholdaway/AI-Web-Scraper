Ruby API for developing extensions

Certificate Status

The certificate status endpoint allows a client to read or alter the
status of a certificate or pending certificate request.
Note: /puppet-ca/v1 API requires certificate-based authentication. The certificate used must have the pp_cli_auth extension. This extension is on the server's certificate by default so curl (and puppetserver ca CLI) calls from the same host as the CA are designed to work out of the box. Using curl from a different host requires issuing a special certificate.
The following is an example of how to interact with this API:
curl -G --cert $(puppet config print hostcert) --key $(puppet config print hostprivkey) --cacert $(puppet config print cacert) https://<PE Server>:8140/puppet-ca/v1/certificate_status/<Node>

Find

GET /puppet-ca/v1/certificate_status/:certname
Accept: application/json, text/pson
Retrieve information about the specified certificate. Similar to puppetserver ca list --certname <certname>.
Search

GET /puppet-ca/v1/certificate_statuses/:any_key?state=:state
Accept: application/json, text/pson
Retrieve information about all known certificates. Similar to puppetserver ca list --all. A key is required but is ignored.

Parameters
state (optional): The certificate state by which to filter search results. Valid states are 'requested', 'signed', and 'revoked'.Save

PUT /puppet-ca/v1/certificate_status/:certname
Content-Type: text/pson
Change the status of the specified certificate. The desired state
is sent in the body of the PUT request as a one-item PSON hash; the two
allowed complete hashes are:

{"desired_state":"signed"} (for signing a certificate signing request, similar to puppetserver ca sign). To set the validity period of the signed certificate, specify the cert_ttl key in the body of the request, with an integer value. By default, this key specifies the number of seconds, but you can specify another time unit. See configuration for a list of Puppet's accepted time unit markers.
{"desired_state":"revoked"} (for revoking a certificate, similar to
puppetserver ca revoke).

Note that revoking a certificate does not clean up other info about the
host; see the DELETE request for more information.
Delete

DELETE /puppet-ca/v1/certificate_status/:hostname
Accept: application/json, text/pson
Cause the certificate authority to discard all SSL information regarding
a host (including any certificates, certificate requests, and keys).
This does not revoke the certificate if one is present; if you wish to
emulate the behavior of puppet cert --clean, you must PUT a
desired_state of revoked before deleting the host’s SSL information.
Note: the /puppet-ca/v1/clean API can be used to accomplish both revoking and cleaning in one request.
If the deletion was successful, it returns a string listing the deleted
classes like
"Deleted for myhost: Puppet::SSL::Certificate, Puppet::SSL::Key"
Otherwise it returns
"Nothing was deleted"

Supported HTTP Methods

This endpoint is disabled in the default configuration. It is
recommended to be careful with this endpoint, as it can allow control
over the certificates used by the puppet primary server.
