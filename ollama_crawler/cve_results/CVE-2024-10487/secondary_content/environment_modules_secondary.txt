        }
    ],
    "name": "env"
}Environment does not exist

If you send a request with an environment parameter that doesn't correspond to the name of a
directory environment on the server, the server returns an HTTP 404 (Not Found) error:
GET /puppet/v3/environment_modules?environment=doesnotexist

HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found

Could not find environment 'doesnotexist'
No environment given
GET /puppet/v3/environment_modules

HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request

An environment parameter must be specifiedEnvironment parameter specified with no value
GET /puppet/v3/environment_modules?environment=

HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request

The environment must be purely alphanumeric, not ''Environment includes non-alphanumeric characters

If the environment parameter in your request includes any characters that are
not A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or _ (underscore), the server returns an HTTP 400 (Bad Request) error:
GET /puppet/v3/environment_modules?environment=bog|us

HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request

The environment must be purely alphanumeric, not 'bog|us'
No metadata.json file
If your modules do not have a metadata.json
file, puppetserver will not be able to determine the version of your module. In
this case, puppetserver will return a null value for version in the response
body.Schema
An environment modules response body conforms to the
environment modules schema.
Validating your json

If you have a response body that you'd like to validate against the
environment_modules.json schema, you can do so using the ruby library
json-schema.
First, install the ruby gem to be used:
gem install json-schema
Next, given a json file, you can validate its schema.
Here is a basic json file called example.json:
{
    "modules": [
        {
            "name": "puppetlabs/ntp",
            "version": "6.0.0"
        },
        {
            "name": "puppetlabs/stdlib",
            "version": "4.16.0"
        }
    ],
    "name": "production"
}
Run this command from the root dir of the puppetserver project (or update the
path to the json schema file in the command below):
ruby -rjson-schema -e "puts JSON::Validator.validate!('./documentation/puppet-api/v3/environment_modules.json','example.json')"
If the json is a valid schema, the command should output true. Otherwise, the
library will print a schema validation error detailing which key or keys validate
the schema.
If you have a response that is the entire list of environment modules (i.e. the
environment_modules endpoint), you will need to use this command to validate
the json schema:
ruby -rjson-schema -e "puts JSON::Validator.validate!('./documentation/puppet-api/v3/environment_modules.json','all.json', :list=>true)"
Authorization

All requests made to the environment modules API are authorized using the
Trapperkeeper-based auth.conf.
For more information about the Puppet Server authorization process and configuration
settings, see the auth.conf documentation.
