Puppet agent on *nix systems

Puppet agent is the
        application that manages the configurations on your nodes. It requires a Puppet primary server to fetch configuration catalogs
        from.
Depending on your infrastructure and needs, you can manage systems
            with Puppet agent as a service, as a cron job, or on
            demand.
For more information about running the puppet agent command, see the puppet agent man page.


Puppet agent's run environment


Puppet agent runs as a specific user, (usually root) and initiates outbound connections on port
        8140.
Ports

Puppet’s HTTPS traffic uses port 8140. Your operating
                system and firewall must allow Puppet agent to
                initiate outbound connections on this port.
If you want to use a non-default port, you have to change the serverport setting on all agent nodes, and ensure
                that you change your primary Puppet server’s port as
                well.
User

Puppet agent runs as root, which lets it manage the
                configuration of the entire system.

Puppet agent can also run as a non-root user, as long
                as it is started by that user. However, this restricts the resources that Puppet agent can manage, and requires you to run Puppet agent as a cron job instead of a
                service.
If you need to install packages into a directory
                controlled by a non-root user, use an exec to unzip a tarball or use a
                    recursive file resource to copy a directory into place.
When running without root permissions, most of Puppet’s resource providers cannot use sudo to elevate
                permissions. This means Puppet can only manage
                resources that its user can modify without using sudo.
Out of the
                core resource types listed in the resource type reference, only the
                following types are available to non-root agents: 







Resource type
Details





augeas





cron

Only non-root cron jobs can be viewed
                                    or set.



exec

Cannot run as another user or
                                    group.



file

Only if the non-root user has
                                    read/write privileges.



notify





schedule





service

For services that don’t require root.
                                    You can also use the start, stop,
                                        and status attributes to specify
                                    how non-root users can control the service.

Manage systems with Puppet agent

In a standard Puppet
        configuration, each node periodically does configuration runs to revert unwanted changes and
        to pick up recent updates.
On *nix nodes, there are three main ways
            to do this:
Run Puppet agent as a
                        service.
The easiest method. The Puppet agent daemon does configuration runs
                        at a set interval, which can be configured.
Make a cron job that runs Puppet agent.
Requires more manual configuration, but a good choice if
                        you want to reduce the number of persistent processes on your systems.
Only run Puppet agent on
                        demand.
You can also deploy MCollective to run on demand on many nodes.


Choose whichever one works best for your infrastructure and
            culture.


Run Puppet agent as a service

The puppet agent command can start a long-lived daemon process that does
      configuration runs at a set interval.



Note: If you are running Puppet agent as a non-root user, use a cron job
               instead.




Start the service.

The best method is with Puppet
                  agent’s init script / service configuration. When you install Puppet with packages, included is an init script or
                  service configuration for controlling Puppet agent,
                  usually with the service name puppet (for both open source and Puppet Enterprise).
In open source Puppet, enable
                  the service by running this
                  command:sudo puppet resource service puppet ensure=running enable=true

You can also run the sudo puppet agent command with no additional
                  options which causes the Puppet agent to start
                  running and daemonize, however you won’t have an interface for restarting or
                  stopping it. To stop the daemon, use the process ID from the agent’s  
pidfile
:sudo kill $(puppet config print pidfile --section agent)




(Optional) Configure the run interval.

The Puppet agent service
                  defaults to doing a configuration run every 30 minutes. You can configure this
                  with the 
runinterval
 setting in  

puppet.conf

:# /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf
[agent]
  runinterval = 2h

If you don’t need frequent configuration runs, a longer run interval lets your
                  primary Puppet server handle many more agent
                  nodes.





Run Puppet agent as a cron
        job

Run Puppet agent as a cron
        job when running as a non-root user. 
If the 
onetime
 setting is set to true, the Puppet agent
                command does one configuration run and then quits. If the daemonize setting is set
                    to false,
                the command stays in the foreground until the run is finished. If set
                    to true, it
                does the run in the background.
This behavior is good for
                building a cron job that does configuration runs. You can use the splay and splaylimit settings to keep the primaryPuppet server from getting overwhelmed, because the
                system time is probably synchronized across all of your agent nodes.

To set up a cron job, run the puppet resource
                    command:

sudo puppet resource cron puppet-agent ensure=present user=root minute=30 command='/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet agent --onetime --no-daemonize --splay --splaylimit 60'The
                        above example runs Puppet one time every
                        hour.  



Run Puppet agent on demand

Some sites prefer to run Puppet agent on-demand, and others use scheduled runs along
        with the occasional on-demand run.

You can start Puppet agent
                runs while logged in to the target system, or remotely with Bolt or MCollective.


Run Puppet agent on
                    one machine, using SSH to log into it:
ssh ops@magpie.example.com sudo puppet agent --test

Results
To run remotely
                on multiple machines, you need some form of orchestration or parallel
                execution tool, such as Bolt or MCollective
                with the puppet agent plugin.

Note: As of Puppet agent 5.5.4, MCollective is deprecated and will be removed in a future
                    version of Puppet agent. If you use open source
                        Puppet, migrate MCollective agents and filters using tools like Bolt and PuppetDB’s Puppet Query Language.


Disable and re-enable Puppet
                runs

Whether you’re troubleshooting errors, working in a
                maintenance window, or developing in a sandbox environment, you might need to
                temporarily disable the Puppet agent from
                running.


To disable the agent, run:
sudo puppet agent --disable "<MESSAGE>"


To enable the agent, run:
sudo puppet agent --enable




Configuring Puppet
                agent

The Puppet agent comes
                with a default configuration that you might want to change.
Configure Puppet agent with puppet.conf using the [agent] section, the [main] section, or both. For information on settings
                        relevant to Puppet agent, see important settings.
Logging for Puppet agent on *nix systems
When running as a service, Puppet agent
                                logs messages to syslog. Your syslog configuration determines where
                                these messages are saved, but the default location is /var/log/messages on Linux, and /var/log/system.log on Mac OS X.
You can adjust how verbose the logs are with the log_level setting, which defaults
                                        to notice.
When running in the foreground with the --verbose, --debug, or --test options, Puppet agent logs directly to the
                                terminal instead of to syslog.
When started with the --logdest
                                        <FILE> option, Puppet agent logs to the file
                                specified by <FILE>.

Reporting for Puppet agent on *nix systems
In addition to local logging, Puppet agent
                                submits a report to the primary Puppet server after each run.
                                This can be disabled by setting report =
                                        false in puppet.conf.)
