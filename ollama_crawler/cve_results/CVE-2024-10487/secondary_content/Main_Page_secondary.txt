Welcome to the Gentoo wiki!
Larry the Cow beckons you to explore the Gentoo wiki!




 Available documentation
To find information use the search box on the top right corner of the screen, or categorically browse the wiki using the Documentation topic links provided below.
Both official Gentoo project documentation as well as community-contributed content can be found here. The vast majority of documentation is publicly editable. Official documents have a Handbook: or Project: prefix (only developers can edit them). Community members can leave comments/feedback for these pages via their respective Discussion pages.
Find something to add or edit? The Getting started section (below) gives contributors a few pointers on how to start editing articles.
Most importantly, the Gentoo Handbook is among the best documents found on the wiki:

December 30, 2023: Community help needed to implement the Anchor template on translated base pages
Earlier this year the wiki team added the {{Anchor}} template like implemented at Wikipedia in order to avoid spamming <span id="link_name"></span> elements within section headers of translated base pages.
Going forward, in order for linking to work properly, this template must be used within each section headers of each base page that has been marked for translation. Although strictly unnecessary, it can also be deployed to base pages not (yet) marked for translation to prepare them for translation. The wiki project welcomes community support for deployment of {{Anchor}} across the rest of the translated articles on the wiki. Deployment has been completed for the Gentoo Handbook pages and the Portage article. Community members who would like to help with this effort can use those pages as a reference.
