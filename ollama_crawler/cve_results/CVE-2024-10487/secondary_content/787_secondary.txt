A malicious actor can leverage this vulnerability to cause a crash, write sensitive data, or execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.CVSS 7.8Autodesk--CVE-2024-9602Type Confusion in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 129.0.6668.100 allowed a remote attacker to perform an out of bounds memory write via a crafted HTML page. (Chromium security severity: High)CVSS 8.8Google-PatchedCVE-2024-9482An out-of-bounds write in the engine module in AVG/Avast Antivirus signature <24092400 released on 24/Sep/2024 on MacOS allows a malformed Mach-O file to crash the application during file processing.CVSS 5.1Avg, et al--CVE-2024-9481An out-of-bounds write in the engine module in AVG/Avast Antivirus signature <24092400 released on 24/Sep/2024 on MacOS allows a malformed eml file to crash the application during file processing.CVSS 5.1Avg, et al--CVE-2024-9468A memory corruption vulnerability in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software allows an unauthenticated attacker to crash PAN-OS due to a crafted packet through the data plane, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. Repeated attempts to trigger this condition will result in PAN-OS entering maintenance mode.CVSS LowPaloaltonetworks--CVE-2024-9143Issue summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted
explicit values for the field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads
or writes.

Impact summary: Out of bound memory writes can lead to an application crash or
even a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all the protocols
involving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we're aware of, either only "named
curves" are supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they
specify an X9.62 encoding of binary (GF(2^m)) curves that can't represent
problematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a vulnerable
application is low.

In particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509 certificates,
so problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509
certificates.  Any problematic use-cases would have to be using an "exotic"
curve encoding.

The affected APIs include: EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m(), EC_GROUP_new_from_params(),
and various supporting BN_GF2m_*() functions.

Applications working with "exotic" explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters,
that make it possible to represent invalid field polynomials with a zero
constant term, via the above or similar APIs, may terminate abruptly as a
result of reading or writing outside of array bounds.  Remote code execution
cannot easily be ruled out.

The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.CVSS LowOpenssl-PatchedCVE-2024-9121Inappropriate implementation in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 129.0.6668.70 allowed a remote attacker to potentially perform out of bounds memory access via a crafted HTML page.
