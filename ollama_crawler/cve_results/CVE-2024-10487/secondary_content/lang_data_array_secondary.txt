Arrays

Arrays are ordered lists of values. Resource attributes
    which accept multiple values (including the relationship metaparameters) generally expect those
    values in an array. Many functions also take arrays, including the iteration
    functions.
Arrays are written as comma-separated
        lists of values surrounded by square brackets, []. An optional trailing comma is allowed between the final value
        and the closing square
        bracket.[ 'one', 'two', 'three' ]
# Equivalent:
[ 'one', 'two', 'three', ]The
        values in an array can be any data type.
Array values are immutable â€” they cannot be changed once they are created.
Accessing items in an array
You can access items in an array by their numerical index, counting from zero. Square
        brackets are used for accessing. For
        example:$my_array = [ 'one', 'two', 'three' ]
notice( $my_array[1] )This manifest would log two as a notice. The value of $my_array[0] would be one, because
        indexes count from zero.
The opening square bracket must not be preceded by white
        space:$my_array = [ 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five' ]
notice( $my_array[2] )  # ok
notice( $my_array [2] ) # syntax error

Nested arrays and hashes can be accessed by chaining
        indexes:$my_array = [ 'one', {'second' => 'two', 'third' => 'three'} ]
notice( $my_array[1]['third'] )This manifest would log three as a notice. $my_array[1] is a hash, and we access a key named 'third'.
Arrays support negative indexes, counting backward from the last element, with -1 being the last element of the
        array:$my_array = [ 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five' ]
notice( $my_array[2] )
notice( $my_array[-2] )The first notice would log three, and the second notice would log four.
If you try to access an element beyond the bounds of the array, its value is undef:$my_array = [ 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five' ]
$cool_value = $my_array[6] # value is undef

When testing with a regular expression whether an Array[<TYPE>] data type matches a given array, empty arrays match if
        the type accepts zero-length
        arrays.$my_array = []
if $my_array =~ Array[String] {
  notice( 'my_array' )
}This manifest would log my_array as a notice,
        because the expression matches the empty array.

Accessing sections of an array
You can access sections of an array by numerical index. Like accessing individual items,
        accessing sections uses square brackets, but it uses two indexes, separated by a comma. For
        example: $array[3,10].
The result of an array section is always another array.
The first number of the index is the start position. Positive numbers count forward from
        the start of the array, starting at zero. Negative numbers count backward from the end
        of the array, starting at -1.
The second number of the index is the stop position. Positive numbers are lengths, counting
        forward from the start position. Negative numbers are absolute positions, counting backward
        from the end of the array starting at -1.
For
        example:$my_array = [ 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five' ]
notice( $my_array[2,1] )  # evaluates to ['three']
notice( $my_array[2,2] )  # evaluates to ['three', 'four']
notice( $my_array[2,-1] ) # evaluates to ['three', 'four', 'five']
notice( $my_array[-2,1] ) # evaluates to ['four']


Array operators
You can use operators with arrays to create new arrays: 

append with <<



concatenate with +



remove elements with -




or to convert arrays to comma-separated lists with *
        (splat). See the Array operators section of Expressions for more information.

Additional functions for arrays
The 
puppetlabs-stdlib
 module contains useful functions for working with arrays, including: 









delete


member


sort




delete_at


prefix


unique




flatten


range


validate_array




grep


reverse


values_at




hash


shuffle


zip




is_array


size

The Array data type

The data type of arrays is Array. By
                                    default, Array matches arrays of any length,
                        provided all values in the array match the abstract data type Data.
                        You can use parameters to restrict which values Array matches.
Parameters
The full signature for Array is:Array[<CONTENT TYPE>, <MIN SIZE>, <MAX SIZE>]These
        parameters are optional. They must be listed in order; if you need to specify a later
        parameter, you must also specify values for any prior ones. 










Position
Parameter
Data type
Default value
Description




1
Content type
Type
Data
The kind of values the array contains. You can specify only one data type per
                  array, and every value in the array must match that type. Use an
                  abstract type to allow multiple data types. If the order of elements matters, use
                    the Tuple type instead of Array.


2
Minimum size
Integer
0
The minimum number of elements in the array. This parameter accepts the
                  special value default, which uses its default
                  value.


3
Maximum size
Integer
infinite
The maximum number of elements in the array. This parameter accepts the
                  special value default, which uses its default
                  value.




Examples:
Array
Matches an array of any length. All elements in the array must match Data.
Array[String]
Matches an array of any size that contains only strings.
Array[Integer, 6]
Matches an array containing at least six integers.
Array[Float, 6, 12]
Matches an array containing at least six and at most 12 floating-point numbers.
Array[Variant[String, Integer]]
Matches an array of any size that contains only strings or integers, or both.
Array[Any, 2]
Matches an array containing at least two elements, allowing any data type
                (including Type and Resource).


The abstract Tuple data type lets you
        specify data types for every element in an array, in order. Abstract types, such
          as Variant and Enum, are useful when specifying content types for arrays that include multiple
        kinds of data.
