Configuring Facter with
      facter.conf

The facter.conf file is a configuration file
      that allows you to cache and block fact groups and facts, and manage how Facter interacts with your system. There are four sections:
         facts, global, cli and fact-groups. All sections
      are optional and can be listed in any order within the file.
When you run Facter from the Ruby API, only the facts section and limited global settings are loaded.
Example facter.conf
         file:facts : {
    blocklist : [ "file system", "EC2", "os.architecture" ],
    ttls : [
        { "timezone" : 30 days },
    ]
}
global : {
    external-dir     : [ "path1", "path2" ],
    custom-dir       : [ "custom/path" ],
    no-exernal-facts : false,
    no-custom-facts  : false,
    no-ruby          : false
}
cli : {
    debug     : false,
    trace     : true,
    verbose   : false,
    log-level : "warn"
}
fact-groups : {
 custom-group-name : ["os.name", "ssh"],
}



Note: The facter.conf file is in hocon format. Use // or # for comments.
         

Location

Facter does not create the facter.conf file automatically, so you must create it manually, or use
            a module to manage it. Facter loads the file by default
               from /etc/puppetlabs/facter/facter.conf on
               *nix systems and C:\ProgramData\PuppetLabs\facter\etc\facter.conf on Windows. Or you can specify a different default with
               the --config command line option:
            facter --config path/to/my/config/file/facter.conf



facts

This section of facter.conf contains settings that
            affect fact groups. A fact group contains one or more individual facts. When you block
            or cache a fact group, all the facts from that group are affected. You can cache any
            type of fact, including custom and external.
The settings in this section are: 


blocklist — Prevents all facts within the listed
                  groups from being resolved when Facter runs. Use
                     the --list-block-group command line
                  option to list valid groups.


ttls — Caches the key-value pairs of groups
                  and their duration to be cached. Use the --list-cache-group command line option to list valid groups.


Cached facts are stored as JSON in /opt/puppetlabs/facter/cache/cached_facts on *nix and C:\ProgramData\PuppetLabs\facter\cache\cached_facts on Windows.




Caching and blocking facts is useful when Facter is
            taking a long time and slowing down your code. When a system has a lot of something —
            for example, mount points or disks — Facter can take a
            long time to collect the facts from each one. When this is a problem, you can speed up
               Facter’s collection by either blocking facts you’re
            uninterested in (blocklist), or caching ones you don’t
            need retrieved frequently (ttls).
To see a list of valid group names, from the command line, run facter --list-block-groups or facter --list-cache-groups. The output shows the fact group
            at the top level, with all facts in that group nested
            below:$ facter --list-block-groups
EC2
  - ec2_metadata
  - ec2_userdata
file system
  - mountpoints
  - filesystems
  - partitionsIf you want to block any of these groups, add the group name
            to the facts section of facter.conf, with the blocklist setting:facts : {
    blocklist : [ "file system" ],
}Here, the file system group has been
            added, so the mountpoints, filesystems, and partitions facts are now prevented from loading.
You can also specify fact names with the blocklist and
               ttls settings. For example:

facts : {
   blocklist : [ "my_external_fact.txt", "my_executable_fact.sh" ],
}



ttls : [
   { "timezone" : 30 days },
   { "networking.hostname" : 6 hours },
]


global

The global section of facter.conf contains settings to control how Facter interacts with its external elements on your
            system. 








Setting
Effect
Default





external-dir

A list of directories to search for external facts.




custom-dir

A list of directories to search for custom facts.




no-external* 
If true, prevents Facter from searching for external facts. 

false




no-custom* 
If true, prevents Facter from searching for custom facts. 

false




no-ruby* 
If true, prevents Facter from loading its Ruby functionality. 

false



 *Not available when you run Facter from the Ruby API.


cli

The cli section of facter.conf contains settings that affect Facter’s command line output. All of these settings are
            ignored when you run Facter from the Ruby API. 








Setting
Effect
Default





debug

If true, Facter outputs debug messages. 

false




trace

If true, Facter prints stacktraces from errors
                           arising in your custom facts. 

false




verbose

If true, Facter outputs its most detailed messages. 

false




log-level

Sets the minimum level of message severity that gets logged. Valid
                           options: "none", "fatal", "error", "warn", "info", "debug", "trace". 

"warn"






fact-groups
The fact-groups group lets you define your own custom groups in
               facter.conf. A group can contain any type of fact, except external
            facts. For aggregated facts, you can specify the root fact using the dot notation. You
            can use these defined groups for blocking (blocklist) or
            caching (ttls).
fact-groups : {
 custom-group-name : ["networking.hostname", "ssh"],
}
