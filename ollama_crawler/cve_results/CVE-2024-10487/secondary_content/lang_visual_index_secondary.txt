Puppet language syntax
        examples
A quick reference of syntax examples for the Puppet
        language. 

Resource examples


Resource declaration
This example resource declaration includes: 


file: The resource type.
                        



ntp.conf: The resource
                                title. 



path: An attribute. 



'/etc/ntp.conf': The value of an
                            attribute; in this case, a string. 



template('ntp/ntp.conf'): A
                                function call that returns a value; in this case, the
                                template function, with the name of a template in a
                                module as its argument. 



file { 'ntp.conf':
  path    => '/etc/ntp.conf',
  ensure  => file,
  content => template('ntp/ntp.conf'),
  owner   => 'root',
  mode    => '0644',
}
For details about resources and resource declaration syntax, see Resources.

Resource relationship metaparameters
Two resource declarations establishing relationships with the before and subscribe
 metaparameters, which accept resource references. 
The first declaration ensures that the ntp package is installed
                before the ntp.conf file is created. The second declaration ensures
                that the ntpd service is notified of any changes to the
                    ntp.conf file.
                package { 'ntp':
  ensure => installed,
  before => File['ntp.conf'],
}
service { 'ntpd':
  ensure    => running,
  subscribe => File['ntp.conf'],
}

For details about relationships usage and syntax, see Relationships and ordering. For details about resource references, see
                    Resource and class references. 

Resource relationship chaining arrows
Chaining arrows forming relationships between three resources, using resource
                references.In this example, the ntp package must be installed
                before the ntp.conf file is created; after the file is created, the
                    ntpd service is notified.

Package['ntp'] -> File['ntp.conf'] ~> Service['ntpd']

For details about relationships usage and syntax, see Relationships and ordering. For details about resource references, see
                    Resource and class references. 

Exported resource declaration
An exported resource declaration.
                @@nagios_service { "check_zfs${hostname}":
  use                 => 'generic-service',
  host_name           => "$fqdn",
  check_command       => 'check_nrpe_1arg!check_zfs',
  service_description => "check_zfs${hostname}",
  target              => '/etc/nagios3/conf.d/nagios_service.cfg',
  notify              => Service[$nagios::params::nagios_service],
}

For information about declaring and collecting exported resources, see Exported resources. 

Resource collector
A resource collector, sometimes called the "spaceship operator."
                Resource collectors select a group of resources by searching the attributes of each
                resource in the catalog.
                User <| groups == 'admin' |>

For details about resource collector usage and syntax, see Resource collectors. 

Exported resource collector
An exported resource collector, which works with exported resources,
                which are available for use by other nodes.
                Concat::Fragment <<| tag == "bacula-storage-dir-${bacula_director}" |>>

For details about resource collector usage and syntax, see Resource collectors. For
                information about declaring and collecting exported resources, see Exported resources. 

Resource default for the exec type
A resource default statement set default attribute values for a given resource type.
                This example specifies defaults for the exec
                resource type attributes path, environment,
                    logoutput, and timeout.
                Exec {
  path        => '/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin',
  environment => 'RUBYLIB=/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/lib/ruby/site_ruby/2.1.0/',
  logoutput   => true,
  timeout     => 180,
}

For details about default statement usage and syntax, see Resource defaults. 

Virtual resource
A virtual resource, which is declared in the catalog but isn't applied
                to a system unless it is explicitly realized.
                @user { 'deploy':
  uid     => 2004,
  comment => 'Deployment User',
  group   => www-data,
  groups  => ["enterprise"],
  tag     => [deploy, web],
}

For details about virtual resource usage and syntax, see Virtual resources. 



Defined resource type examples


Defined resource type definition
Defining a type creates a new defined resource type. The name of this defined
                    type has two namespace segments, comprising the name of the module
                containing the defined type, apache, and the name of the defined
                type itself, vhost. 

define apache::vhost ($port, $docroot, $servername = $title, $vhost_name = '*') {
  include apache
  include apache::params
  $vhost_dir = $apache::params::vhost_dir
  file { "${vhost_dir}/${servername}.conf":
    content => template('apache/vhost-default.conf.erb'),
    owner   => 'www',
    group   => 'www',
    mode    => '644',
    require => Package['httpd'],
    notify  => Service['httpd'],
  }


For details about defined type usage and syntax, see Defined resource types. 

Defined type resource declaration
Declarations of an instance, or resource, of a defined type are similar to other
                resource declarations. This example declares a instance of the
                    apache::vhost defined type, with a title of "homepages" and the
                    port and docroot attributes specified.

apache::vhost { 'homepages':
  port       => 8081,
  docroot => '/var/www-testhost',
} 

For details about defined type usage and syntax, see Defined resource types. 

Defined type resource reference
A resource reference to an instance of the apache::vhost defined
                resource. Every namespace segment in a resource reference must be capitalized.

Apache::Vhost['homepages']

For details about defined type usage and syntax, see Defined resource types. For details about resource references, see
                    Resource and class references. 



Class examples


Class definition
A class definition, which makes a class available for later use.

class ntp {
  package {'ntp':
    ...
  }
  ...
}

For details about class usage and syntax, see Classes. 

Class declaration
Declaring the ntp class in three different ways: 
the include function 

the require function 


the resource-like syntax

Declaring a class causes the resources in it to be managed. 
The  include function is the standard way to declare classes:
                include ntp

The require function declares the class and makes it a dependency of
                the code container where it is declared: require ntp

The resource-like syntax declares the class and applies resource-like behavior.
                Resource-like class declarations require that you declare a given class only one
                time. class {'ntp':}

For details about class usage and syntax, see Classes. 



Variable examples


Variable assigned an array value
A variable being assigned a set of values as an array. 

$package_list = ['ntp', 'apache2', 'vim-nox', 'wget']

For details about assigning values to variables, see Variables. 

Variable assigned a hash value
A variable being assigned a set of values as a hash.

$myhash = { key => { subkey => 'b' } }

For details about assigning values to variables, see Variables. 

Interpolated variable
A built-in variable provided by the primary server being interpolated into a
                double-quoted string.

...
content => "Managed by puppet server version ${serverversion}"

For details about built-in variables usage and syntax, see Facts and built-in variables. For information about strings and
                interpolation, see Strings. 



Conditional statement examples



if statement, using expressions and facts
An if statement, whose conditions are expressions that use facts
                provided by the agent.
                if $is_virtual {
  warning( 'Tried to include class ntp on virtual machine; this node might be misclassified.' )
}
elsif $operatingsystem == 'Darwin' {
  warning( 'This NTP module does not yet work on our Mac laptops.' )
else {
  include ntp
}

For details about if statements, see Conditional statements and expressions. 


if statement, with in
                expression
An if statement using an in expression.
                if 'www' in $hostname {
  ...
}

For details about if statements, see Conditional statements and expressions. 

Case statement
A case statement.
                case $operatingsystem {
  'RedHat', 'CentOS': { include role::redhat  }
  /^(Debian|Ubuntu)$/:{ include role::debian  }
  default:            { include role::generic }
}

For details about case statements, see Conditional statements and expressions. 

Selector statement
A selector statement being used to set the value of the $rootgroup
                variable. $rootgroup = $osfamily ? {
    'RedHat'          => 'wheel',
    /(Debian|Ubuntu)/ => 'wheel',
    default            => 'root',
}

For details about selector statements, see Conditional statements and expressions. 



Node examples


Node definition
A node definition or node statement is a block of Puppet code that is included only in matching nodes’ catalogs. This allows you to assign
                specific configurations to specific nodes.

node 'www1.example.com' {
  include common
  include apache
  include squid
}

Node names in node definitions can also be given as regular expressions.

node /^www\d+$/ {
  include common
}

For details about node definition usage and syntax, see Node definitions.
