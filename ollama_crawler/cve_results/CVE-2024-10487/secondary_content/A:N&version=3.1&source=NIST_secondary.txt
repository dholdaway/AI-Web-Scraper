 Common Vulnerability Scoring
						System Calculator
						CVE-2020-10487


Source: NIST



						This page shows the components of a CVSS 
						assessment and allows you to refine the resulting CVSS score with additional or different metric values. 
						Please read the CVSS standards guide to fully understand how
						to assess vulnerabilities using CVSS and to interpret the resulting scores. 
						The	scores are computed in sequence such that the Base Score is used
						to calculate the Temporal Score and the Temporal Score is used to
						calculate the Environmental Score.

								metrics in order to generate a score!
