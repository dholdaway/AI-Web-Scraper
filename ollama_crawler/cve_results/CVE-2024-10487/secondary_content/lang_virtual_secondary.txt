Virtual resources

A virtual resource declaration specifies a desired state for a resource without
    enforcing that state. Puppet manages the resource by realizing it
    elsewhere in your manifests. This divides the work done by a normal resource declaration into
    two steps. Although virtual resources are declared one time, they can be realized any number of
    times, similar to a class.
Purpose
Virtual resources are useful for:

Resources whose management depends on at least one of multiple conditions being
              met.


Overlapping sets of resources required by any number of classes.


Resources which are managed only if multiple cross-class conditions are met.



Because they both offer a safe way to add a resource to the catalog in multiple locations,
        virtual resources can be used in some of the same situations as classes. The features that distinguish
        virtual resources are:

Searchability via resource collectors, which
              helps to realize overlapping clumps of virtual resources.


Flatness, such that you can declare a virtual resource and realize it a few lines
              later without having to clutter your modules with many single-resource classes.




Syntax
Virtual resources are used in two steps: declaring and realizing. In this example, the
          apache class declares a virtual resource, and both the
          wordpress and freight
        classes realize it. The resource is managed on any node that has the wordpress or freight classes applied to it.
Declare: modules/apache/manifests/init.pp
@a2mod { 'rewrite':
  ensure => present,
} # note: The a2mod resource type is from the puppetlabs-apache module.Realize:
          modules/wordpress/manifests/init.pp
realize A2mod['rewrite']Realize
        again: modules/freight/manifests/init.pp
realize A2mod['rewrite']To
        declare a virtual resource, prepend @ (the “at” sign) to the
        resource type of a normal resource
          declaration:@user {'deploy':
  uid     => 2004,
  comment => 'Deployment User',
  groups  => ["enterprise"],
  tag     => [deploy, web],
}To realize one or more virtual resources by title, use the 
 realize
 function, which accepts one or more resource references:realize(User['deploy'], User['zleslie'])

Note: The realize function can be used multiple
          times on the same virtual resource and the resource is managed only one time.A
          resource collector realizes any virtual resources
        that match its search
        expression:User <| tag == web |>If
        multiple resource collectors match a given virtual resource, Puppet manages only that resource one time.


Note: A collector also collects and realizes any exported resources from the
          current node. If you use exported resources that you don’t want realized, take care to
          exclude them from the collector’s search expression. Also, a collector used in an override block or a  chaining statement also realizes any
          matching virtual resources.


Behavior
A virtual resource declaration does not manage the state of a resource. Instead, it makes a
        virtual resource available to resource collectors and the realize function. When a resource is realized, Puppet manages its state. 
Unrealized virtual resources are included in the catalog, but are marked inactive.


Note: Virtual resources do not depend on evaluation order. You can realize a
          virtual resource before the resource has been declared.

CAUTION: The realize function causes a
          compilation failure when attempting to realize a virtual resource that has not been
          declared. Resource collectors fail silently when they do not match any
        resources.When a virtual resource is contained in a class, it cannot be realized
        unless the class is declared at some point during the compilation. A common pattern is to
        declare a class full of virtual resources and then use a collector to choose the set of
        resources you need:

include virtual::users
User <| groups == admin or group == wheel |>

Note: You can declare virtual resources of defined resource types. This causes
          every resource contained in the defined resource to behave virtually — they are not
          managed unless their virtual container is realized.Virtual resources are evaluated
        in the run stage in which they are declared, not
        the run stage in which they are realized.
