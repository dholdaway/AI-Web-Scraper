Ruby API for developing extensions

v2 (Jolokia) metrics
By default, Puppet Server enables two optional web APIs for
Java Management Extension (JMX)
metrics, namely
managed beans (MBeans). For the older metrics API, see the /metrics/v1 documentation.
Jolokia endpoints

The v2 metrics endpoint uses the Jolokia library, an extensive open-source metrics library with its own documentation.
The documentation below provides only the information you need to use the metrics as configured by default for Puppet Server, but Jolokia offers more features than are described below. Consult the Jolokia documentation for more information.
For security reasons, we enable only the read-access Jolokia interface by default:

read
list
version
search


Configuring Jolokia

To change the security access policy, create the /etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/jolokia-access.xml file with contents that follow the Jolokia access policy and uncomment the metrics.metrics-webservice.jolokia.servlet-init-params.policyLocation parameter before restarting puppetserver.
The metrics.metrics-webservice.jolokia.servlet-init-params table
within the /etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/conf.d/metrics.conf file provides more configuration options. See Jolokia's agent initialization documentation for all of the available options.
Disabling the endpoints
To disable the v2 endpoints, set the metrics.metrics-webservice.jolokia.enabled parameter in metrics.conf to false.Usage
You can query the metrics v2 API using GET or POST requests.
GET /metrics/v2/

(Introduced in Puppet Server 5)
This endpoint requires an operation, and depending on the operation can accept or might require an additional query:
GET /metrics/v2/<OPERATION>/<QUERY>

Response
A successful request returns a JSON document.Examples

To list all valid mbeans querying the metrics endpoint
GET /metrics/v2/list
Which should return a response similar to
{
  "request": {
    "type": "list"
  },
  "value": {
    "java.util.logging": {
      "type=Logging": {
        "op": {
          "getLoggerLevel": {
            ...
          },
          ...
        },
        "attr": {
          "LoggerNames": {
            "rw": false,
            "type": "[Ljava.lang.String;",
            "desc": "LoggerNames"
          },
          "ObjectName": {
            "rw": false,
            "type": "javax.management.ObjectName",
            "desc": "ObjectName"
          }
        },
        "desc": "Information on the management interface of the MBean"
      }
    },
    ...
  }
}
So, from the example above we could query for the registered logger names with
this HTTP call:
GET /metrics/v2/read/java.util.logging:type=Logging/LoggerNames
Which would return the JSON document
{
  "request": {
    "mbean": "java.util.logging:type=Logging",
    "attribute": "LoggerNames",
    "type": "read"
  },
  "value": [
    "javax.management.snmp",
    "global",
    "javax.management.notification",
    "javax.management.modelmbean",
    "javax.management.timer",
    "javax.management",
    "javax.management.mlet",
    "javax.management.mbeanserver",
    "javax.management.snmp.daemon",
    "javax.management.relation",
    "javax.management.monitor",
    "javax.management.misc",
    ""
  ],
  "timestamp": 1497977258,
  "status": 200
}
The MBean names can then be created by joining the the first two keys of the
value table with a colon (the domain and prop list in Jolokia parlance).
Querying the MBeans is achieved via the read operation. The read operation
has as its GET signature:
GET /metrics/v2/read/<MBEAN NAMES>/<ATTRIBUTES>/<OPTIONAL INNER PATH FILTER>
POST /metrics/v2/<OPERATION>
You can also submit a POST request with the query as a JSON document in the body of the POST.Filtering
The new Jolokia-based metrics API also provides globbing (wildcard selection) and response filtering features.
Example

You can combine both of these features to query garbage collection data, but return only the collection counts and times.
GET metrics/v2/read/java.lang:name=*,type=GarbageCollector/CollectionCount,CollectionTime
This returns a JSON response:
{
  "request": {
    "mbean": "java.lang:name=*,type=GarbageCollector",
    "attribute": [
      "CollectionCount",
      "CollectionTime"
    ],
    "type": "read"
  },
  "value": {
    "java.lang:name=PS Scavenge,type=GarbageCollector": {
      "CollectionTime": 1314,
      "CollectionCount": 27
    },
    "java.lang:name=PS MarkSweep,type=GarbageCollector": {
      "CollectionTime": 580,
      "CollectionCount": 5
    }
  },
  "timestamp": 1497977710,
  "status": 200
}
Refer to the
Jolokia protocol documentation
for more advanced usage.
