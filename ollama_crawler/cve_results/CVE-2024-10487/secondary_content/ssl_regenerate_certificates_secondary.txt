Regenerating certificates in a Puppet deployment

In some cases, you might need to regenerate the
        certificates and security credentials (private and public keys) that are generated by Puppet’s built-in PKI systems.
For example, you might have a Puppet
            primary server you need to move to a different network in your infrastructure, or you might have
            experienced a security vulnerability that makes existing credentials untrustworthy.


Tip: There are other, more automated ways of doing this. We recommend using
                    Bolt to regenerate certs when needed. See the
                    Bolt documentation for more information. There is also a
                supported ca_extend module, which you can use to
                extend the expiry date of a certificate authority (CA).

Important: The information on this page describes the
                steps for regenerating certs in an open source Puppet
                deployment. If you use Puppet Enterprise do not use
                the information on this page, as it leaves you with an incomplete replacement and
                non-functional deployment. Instead, PE customers
                must refer to one of the following pages: 

Regenerating certificatesPE deployments














If your goal is to...


Do this...





Regenerate an agent’s certificate


Clear and
                                        regenerate certs for Puppet
                                        agents




Fix a compromised or damaged certificate
                                authority


Regenerate
                                        the CA and all certificates




Completely regenerate all Puppet deployment
                                certificates


Regenerate
                                        the CA and all certificates




Add DNS alt-names or other certificate
                                extensions to your existing Puppet
                                primary server

Regenerate the agent certificate of your Puppet primary server and add DNS
                                    alt-names or other certificates







Regenerate the agent certificate of your Puppet primary server and add DNS alt-names or other certificate
        extensions

This option preserves the primary server/agent relationship and
        lets you add DNS alt-names or certificate extensions to your existing primary server.


 Revoke the Puppet
                    primary server’s certificate and clean the CA files pertaining to it. Note that the
                    agents won’t be able to connect to the primary server until all of the following steps
                    are finished.
puppetserver ca clean --certname <CERTNAME_OF_YOUR_SERVER>


Remove the agent-specific copy of the public key,
                    private key, and certificate-signing request  pertaining to the
                    certificate:
puppet ssl clean


Stop the Puppet
                    primary server service:

puppet resource service puppetserver ensure=stopped

Note: The CA and server run in the same
                                primary server so this also stops the CA.



After you’ve stopped the primary server and CA service,
                    create a certificate signed by the CA and add DNS alt names (comma
                    separated):

 puppetserver ca generate --certname <CERTNAME> --subject-alt-names <DNS ALT NAMES> --ca-client

Note:

If you don’t want to add DNS alt names to your primary server, omit
                                the --subject-alt-names <DNS ALT
                                    NAMES> option from the command above.
Although this particular use of the generate
                                command requires you to stop puppetserver service,
                                all other uses of this command require the service to be
                                running.
If the tool cannot determine the status of the server, but you know
                                the server is offline, you can use the --force option to run the command without checking
                                server status.





Restart the Puppet
                    primary server service:
puppet resource service puppetserver ensure=running




Regenerate the CA and all certificates


CAUTION: This process destroys the certificate authority and
                    all other certificates. It is meant for use in the event of a total compromise
                    of your site, or some other unusual circumstance. If you want to preserve the
                    primary server/agent relationship, regenerate the
                        agent certificate of your Puppet
                        primary server. If you just need to replace a few agent certificates, clear
                        and regenerate certs for Puppet
                    agents.


Step 1: Clear and regenerate certs on your primary Puppet server


On the primary server hosting the CA:


Back up the SSL
                    directory, which is in /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/. If something goes
                    wrong, you can restore this directory so your deployment can stay functional.
                    However, if you needed to regenerate your certs for security reasons and
                    couldn’t, get some assistance as soon as possible so you can keep your site
                    secure.


Stop the agent service:

sudo puppet resource service puppet ensure=stopped




Stop the primary server service.

For Puppet Server, run:
                        sudo puppet resource service puppetserver ensure=stopped




Delete the SSL directory:

sudo rm -r /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl



Regenerate the CA and primary server's cert:


sudo puppetserver ca setup



You will see this message: Notice: Signed
                            certificate request for ca.



Start the primary server  service by running: 


sudo puppet resource service puppetserver ensure=running




Start the Puppet
                    agent service by running this command:

sudo puppet resource service puppet ensure=running




Results
At this point: 
You have a new CA certificate and
                            key.
Your primary server has a certificate from the new CA, and it can field new certificate requests. 
The primary server  rejects any requests for configuration catalogs from nodes that haven’t
                            replaced their certificates. At this point, it is all of them except
                            itself. 
When using any extensions that rely on Puppet certificates, like
                                PuppetDB, the primary server won’t be
                            able to communicate with them. Consequently, it might not be able to
                            serve catalogs, even to agents that do have new certificates. 




Step 2: Clear and regenerate certs for any
                                extension

You might be using an extension, like PuppetDB or MCollective, to enhance Puppet. These extensions probably use certificates from Puppet’s CA in order to communicate securely with the primary Puppet server. For each extension like this, you’ll need to
    regenerate the certificates it uses. 
Many tools have scripts or documentation to
                                                help you set up SSL, and you can often just re-run
                                                the setup instructions.

PuppetDB

We recommend PuppetDB users first follow the instructions in
        Step 3: Clear and regenerate certs for agents, below, because PuppetDB re-uses Puppet agents’
        certificates. After that, restart the PuppetDB service. See
          Redo SSL setup after changing certificates for more information.
      



Step 3: Clear and regenerate certs for Puppet agents

To replace the certs on agents, you’ll need to
                                log into each agent node and do the following steps.


Stop the agent
                                                  service. On *nix:

sudo puppet resource service puppet ensure=stoppedOn
                                                  Windows, with
                                                  Administrator
                                                  privileges: puppet resource service puppet ensure=stopped



Locate Puppet’s SSL
                                                  directory and delete its
                                                  contents.
The SSL directory can be
                                                  determined by running puppet config print
                                                  ssldir --section agent



Restart the
                                                  agent service. On *nix:

sudo puppet resource service puppet ensure=runningOn
                                                  Windows, with
                                                  Administrator
                                                  privileges:puppet resource service puppet ensure=running

When the agent starts, it generates keys and requests a new certificate from the CA primary
            server.


If you are not using autosigning, log in to the CA primary server and sign each agent
          node’s certificate request.

To view pending requests,
            run:sudo puppetserver ca list

To sign requests,
            run:sudo puppetserver ca sign --certname <NAME>



After an agent node’s new certificate is signed, it's retrieved within a few minutes
            and a Puppet run starts.



Results
After you have regenerated all agents’
                                                  certificates, everything will be fully functional
                                                  under the new CA.


Note: You can
                                                  achieve the same results by turning these steps
                                                  into Bolt tasks or
                                                  plans. See the Bolt documentation for
                                                  more information.
