External CA

This information describes the supported and tested
        configurations for external CAs in this version of Puppet. If
        you have an external CA use case that isn’t listed here, contact Puppet so we can learn more about it.
Supported external CA configurations
This version of Puppet
                supports some external CA configurations, however not every possible
                configuration is supported. 
We fully support the following setup options:

Single CA which directly issues SSL certificates.



Puppet Server functioning as an intermediate
                            CA.



Fully supported by Puppet means:

If issues arise that are considered bugs, we'll fix them as soon as
                            possible. 


If issues arise in any other external CA setup that are
                            considered feature requests, we’ll consider whether to expand
                            our support.






Option 1: Puppet Server functioning as an
        intermediate CA


Puppet Server can operate as an intermediate CA to an external root
        CA.
See Using Puppet Server as an intermediate
                certificate authority.


Option 2: Single CA

When Puppet uses its
        internal CA, it defaults to a single CA configuration. A single externally issued CA can
        also be used in a similar manner.



This is an all or nothing configuration rather than a mix-and-match.
            When using an external CA, the built-in Puppet CA
            service must be disabled and cannot be used to issue SSL certificates.

Note:
Puppet cannot automatically distribute certificates
                in this configuration.



Puppet Server




Configure Puppet Server in three steps: 

Disable the internal CA service.


Ensure that the certname does not change.


Put certificates and keys in place on disk.






Edit the Puppet Server/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/services.d/ca.cfg file:


To disable the internal CA, comment out
                        puppetlabs.services.ca.certificate-authority-service/certificate-authority-service
                     and uncomment
                        puppetlabs.services.ca.certificate-authority-disabled-service/certificate-authority-disabled-service.




Set a static value for the certname setting in puppet.conf:


[server]
certname = puppetserver.example.com
Setting
                  a static value prevents any confusion if the machine's hostname changes. The value
                  must match the certname you’ll use to issue the server's certificate, and it must
                  not be blank.



Put the credentials from your external CA on disk in
               the correct locations. These locations must match what’s configured in
                  your webserver.conf
                  file. 

If you haven’t changed those settings, run the following
                  commands to find the default locations. 







Credential
File location




Server SSL certificate

puppet config print hostcert --section
                                    server



Server SSL certificate private
                                 key

puppet config print hostprivkey --section
                                    server



Root CA certificate

puppet config print localcacert --section
                                    server



Root certificate revocation list

puppet config print hostcrl --section
                                    server





If you’ve put the credentials in the correct locations, you
                  don't need to change any additional settings.






Puppet agent

You don’t need to change any settings. Put the external
        credentials into the correct filesystem locations. You can run the following commands to
        find the appropriate locations.








Credential
File location




Agent SSL certificate
puppet config print hostcert --section
                            agent


Agent SSL certificate private key
puppet config print hostprivkey --section
                                agent


Root CA certificate
puppet config print localcacert --section
                                agent


Root certificate revocation list
puppet config print hostcrl --section
                            agent





General notes and requirements


PEM encoding of credentials is mandatory

Puppet expects its SSL credentials to be
                    in .pem format.

Normal Puppet certificate requirements still
                apply
Any Puppet Server certificate must contain the DNS name,
                either as the Subject Common Name (CN) or as a Subject Alternative Name (SAN), that
                agent nodes use to attempt contact with the server.

Client DN authentication 

Puppet Server is hosted by a Jetty web server; therefore.
                For client authentication purposes, Puppet Server can
                extract the distinguished name (DN) from a client certificate provided during SSL
                negotiation with the Jetty web server.
The use of an X-Client-DN request header is supported
                for cases where SSL termination of client requests needs to be done on an external
                server. See External SSL Termination with Puppet Server for
                details.

Web server configuration
Use the webserver.conf file for
                    Puppet Server to configure Jetty. Several ssl- settings can be added to the webserver.conf file to
                enable the web server to use the correct SSL configuration:



ssl-cert: The value of puppet server --configprint hostcert. Equivalent
                        to the ‘SSLCertificateFile’ Apache config setting.



ssl-key: The value of puppet server --configprint hostprivkey. Equivalent to the
                        ‘SSLCertificateKeyFile’ Apache config setting.



ssl-ca-cert: The value of puppet server --configprint localcacert.
                        Equivalent to the ‘SSLCACertificateFile’ Apache config setting.



ssl-cert-chain: Equivalent to the
                        ‘SSLCertificateChainFile’ Apache config setting. Optional.



ssl-crl-path: The path to the CRL file to
                        use. Optional.


An example webserver.conf file might look something
                like this: webserver: { 
 client-auth : want  
 ssl-host    : 0.0.0.0  
 ssl-port    : 8140  
 ssl-cert    : /path/to/server.pem  
 ssl-key     : /path/to/server.key  
 ssl-ca-cert : /path/to/ca_bundle.pem  
 ssl-cert-chain : /path/to/ca_bundle.pem  
 ssl-crl-path : /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/crl.pem
}For more information on these settings, seeConfiguring the Web Server Service. 

Restart required 
After the above changes are made to Puppet Server’s
                configuration files, you’ll have to restart the Puppet Server service for the new settings to take effect.
