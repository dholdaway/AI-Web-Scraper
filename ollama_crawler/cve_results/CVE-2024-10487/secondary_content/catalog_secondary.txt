Ruby API for developing extensions

Catalog API
The catalog API returns a compiled catalog for the node specified in the request,
making use of provided metadata like facts or environment if specified.
If not specified, it will attempt to fetch this data from Puppet's configured sources
(usually PuppetDB or a node classifier). The returned catalog is in JSON format,
ready to be parsed and applied by an agent.
POST /puppet/v4/catalog

(Introduced in Puppet Server 6.3.0)
The input data for the catalog to be compiled is submitted as a JSON body with the
following form:
{
  "certname": "<node name>",
  "persistence": { "facts": <true/false>, "catalog": <true/false> },
  "environment": "<environment name>",
  # The rest are optional:
  "facts": { "values": { "<fact name>": <fact value>, ... } },
  "trusted_facts": { "values": { "<fact name>": <fact value>, ... } },
  "transaction_uuid": "<uuid string>",
  "job_id": "<id string>",
  "options": { "prefer_requested_environment": <true/false>,
               "capture_logs": <true/false>,
               "log_level": <err/warning/info/debug> }
}


certname (required)
The name of the node for which to compile the catalog.
persistence (required)
A hash containing two required keys, facts and catalog, which when set to true will
cause the facts and reports to be stored in PuppetDB, or discarded if set to false.
environment (required)
The name of the environment for which to compile the catalog. If prefer_requested_environemnt
is true, override the classified environment with this param. If it is false, only respect this
if the classifier allows an agent-specified environment.facts
A hash with a required values key, containing a hash of all the facts for the node.
If not provided, Puppet will attempt to fetch facts for the node from PuppetDB.trusted_facts
A hash with a required values key containing a hash of the trusted facts for a node.
In a normal agent's catalog request, these would be extracted from the cert, but this
endpoint does not require a cert for the node whose catalog is being compiled. If not
provided, Puppet will attempt to fetch the trusted facts for the node from PuppetDB or
from the provided facts hash.transaction_uuid
The id for tracking the catalog compilation and report submission.job_id
The id of the orchestrator job that triggered this run.options

A hash of options beyond direct input to catalogs.
prefer_requested_environment
Whether to always override a node's classified environment with the one supplied in the
request. If this is true and no environment is supplied, fall back to the classified
environment, or finally, 'production'.
capture_logs
Whether to return the errors and warnings that occurred during compilation alongside the
catalog in the response body.
log_level
The logging level to use during the compile when capture_logs is true. Options are
'err', 'warning', 'info', and 'debug'.
Example

Use the following as a worked example of how to make a call to the Catalog API:
   
   type_header='Content-Type: application/json'
   auth_header='X-Authentication: <token>'
   uri='<https://<primary> server>:8140/puppet/v4/catalog'
   data='{"certname": "<certname>", "persistence": { "facts": false, "catalog": false }, "environment": "production"}'
   curl --insecure --header "$type_header" --header "$auth_header" --request POST "$uri" --data "$data" -o <certname>-<environment>.json
Schema
The catalog response body conforms to the catalog schema.Authorization
All requests made to the catalog API are authorized using the Trapperkeeper-based auth.conf.
For more information about the Puppet Server authorization process and configuration settings,
see the auth.conf documentation.
