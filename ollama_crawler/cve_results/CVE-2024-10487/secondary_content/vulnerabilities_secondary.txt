Vulnerabilities
		
					This documentation assumes that you already understand at least one common programming 
					language and are generally familiar with JSON RESTful services.  JSON specifies the 
					format of the data returned by the REST service. REST refers to a style of services 
					that allow computers to communicate via HTTP over the Internet.  
					Click here for a list of 
					best practices and additional information 
					on where to start. The NVD is also documenting  
					popular workflows to assist developers 
					working with the APIs. 
				


CVE API

					The CVE API is used to easily retrieve information on a single CVE or a collection 
					of CVE from the NVD. The NVD contains 267,641
					CVE records. Because of this, its APIs enforce  			
					offset-based pagination to answer requests for large collections.  Through a series of 
					smaller “chunked” responses controlled by an offset startIndex and a page 
					limit resultsPerPage users may page through all the CVE in the NVD.   
				

					The URL stem for retrieving CVE information is shown below.

				Parameters
			





cpeName optional

{name}

	
							This parameter returns all CVE associated with a specific CPE. 
							The exact value provided with cpeName is compared 
							against the CPE Match Criteria within a CVE applicability 
							statement. If the value of cpeName is considered 
							to match, the CVE is included in the results.  
						

							A CPE Name is a string of characters comprised of 13 colon separated values that 
							describe a product. In CPEv2.3 the first two values are always “cpe” and “2.3”.  
							The 11 values that follow are referred to as the CPE components.  
							When filtering by cpeName the part, vendor, product, and version components 
							are required to contain values other than "*".  
						

							CPE Match Criteria comes in two forms: CPE Match Strings and CPE Match String Ranges.
							Both are abstract concepts that are then correlated to CPE URIs in the Official CPE 
							Dictionary. Unlike a CPE Name, match strings and match string ranges do not require 
							a value in the part, vendor, product, or version components. The CVE API returns 
							CPE Match Criteria within the configurations object. 																		
						


Request the CVE associated a specific CPE

							This parameter returns the CVE that appear in CISA's 
							Known Exploited Vulnerabilities 
							(KEV) Catalog. Please note, this parameter is provided without a parameter value. 
						


Request all CVE that appear in the KEV catalog 

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?hasKev 





hasOval optional
	
							This parameter returns the CVE that contain information from MITRE's
							Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language 
							(OVAL) before this transitioned to the Center for Internet Security (CIS). Please note, 
							this parameter is provided without a parameter value.
						


Request all CVE containing an OVAL record 

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?hasOval 





isVulnerable optional
	
							This parameter returns only CVE associated with a specific CPE,
							where the CPE is also considered vulnerable. The exact value provided 
							with cpeName is compared against the CPE Match Criteria 
							within a CVE applicability statement. If the value of cpeName 
							is considered to match, and is also considered vulnerable the CVE is included 
							in the results.	
						

							If filtering by isVulnerable, cpeName  
							is required. Please note, 
							virtualMatchString is not accepted in requests 
							that use isVulnerable.
						


Request all CVE associated a specific CPE and are marked as vulnerable 

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?cpeName=cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_10:1607&isVulnerable 





keywordExactMatch optional
	
							By default, keywordSearch returns any CVE where a word or phrase 								
							is found in the current description. 	
						

							If the value of keywordSearch is a phrase, i.e., contains more than 
							one term, including keywordExactMatch returns only the CVEs matching 
							the phrase exactly. Otherwise, the results will contain records having any of the
							terms.  If filtering by keywordExactMatch, keywordSearch 
							is required.

Request all CVE mentioning the exact phrase "Microsoft Outlook"

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?keywordSearch=Microsoft Outlook&keywordExactMatch


							Please note, the example above would not return a CVE unless the exact phrase 
							"Microsoft Outlook" appears in the current description.
						




keywordSearch optional

{keyword(s)}
	
							This parameter returns only the CVEs where a word or phrase is found in the 
							current description. Descriptions associated with CVE are maintained by the 
							CVE Assignment Team through coordination with CVE Numbering 
							Authorities (CNAs). The NVD has no control over CVE descriptions.
						

							Please note, empty spaces in the URL should be encoded in the request as "%20". 
							The user agent may handle this encoding automatically.  Multiple {keywords} 
							function like an 'AND' statement. This returns results where all keywords exist 
							somewhere in the current description, though not necessarily together. Keyword search 
							operates as though a wildcard is placed after each keyword provided. For example, providing 
							"circle" will return results such as "circles" but not "encircle".

lastModStartDate & lastModEndDate optional

{start date}
{end date}

	
							These parameters return only the CVEs that were last 			
							modified during the specified period. If a CVE has been modified 
							more recently than the specified period, it will not be included 
							in the response.  If filtering by the last modified date, both 
							lastModStartDate and lastModEndDate are required.  
							The maximum allowable range when using any date range parameters 
							is 120 consecutive days. 
						

							A CVE's lastModified changes when any of the follow actions occur: 
						

The NVD publishes the new CVE record
The NVD changes the status of a published CVE record after it has been analyzed
A source (CVE Primary CNA or another CNA) modifies a published CVE record


							A CVE's lastModified does not change when any of the follow actions occur: 
						

The NVD changes the status of a newly published CVE record to "Undergoing Analysis"
The NVD modifies a CPE record previously associated with the CVE record


							Values must be entered in the extended ISO-8601 date/time format:							
						
[YYYY][“-”][MM][“-”][DD][“T”][HH][“:”][MM][“:”][SS][Z]

							The "T" is a literal to separate the date from the time. The Z indicates 
							an optional offset-from-UTC. Please note, if a positive Z value is used 
							(such as +01:00 for Central European Time) then the "+" should be encoded 
							in the request as "%2B". The user agent may handle this encoding automatically. 
						


Request all CVE records modified between the start and end datetimes

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0/?lastModStartDate=2021-08-04T13:00:00.000%2B01:00&lastModEndDate=2021-10-22T13:36:00.000%2B01:00

							By default, the CVE API includes CVE records with the REJECT or Rejected status.   
							This parameter excludes CVE records with the REJECT or Rejected status from API response. 
							Please note, this parameter is provided without a parameter value.
						


Request all CVE without the REJECT or Rejected status

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?noRejected 





pubStartDate & pubEndDate optional

{start date}
{end date}

	
							These parameters return only the CVEs that were added to the NVD 
							(i.e., published) during the specified period. If filtering by 
							the published date, both 
							pubStartDate and pubEndDate are required.  
							The maximum allowable range when using any date range parameters 
							is 120 consecutive days. 
						

							Values must be entered in the extended ISO-8601 date/time format:							
						
[YYYY][“-”][MM][“-”][DD][“T”][HH][“:”][MM][“:”][SS][Z]

							The "T" is a literal to separate the date from the time. The Z indicates 
							an optional offset-from-UTC. Please note, if a positive Z value is used 
							(such as +01:00 for Central European Time) then the "+" should be encoded 
							in the request as "%2B". The user agent may handle this encoding automatically. 
						


Request all CVE published between the start and end dates, defaulting to GMT

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0/?pubStartDate=2021-08-04T00:00:00.000&pubEndDate=2021-10-22T00:00:00.000




Request all CVE published between the start and end datetimes

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0/?pubStartDate=2020-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00&pubEndDate=2020-01-14T23:59:59.999-05:00





resultsPerPage optional

{page limit}

	
							This parameter specifies the maximum number of CVE records to be returned 
							in a single API response. For network considerations, the default value and maximum 
							allowable limit is 2,000. 
						

							It is recommended that users of the CVE API use the default resultsPerPage value.  
							This value has been optimized to allow the greatest number of results over the fewest number of requests. 
						




startIndex optional

{offset}

	
							This parameter specifies the index of the first CVE to be returned in 
							the response data. The index is zero-based, meaning the first CVE 
							is at index zero.  
						

							The CVE API returns four primary objects in the response body that are 
							used for pagination:
							resultsPerPage, startIndex, totalResults, 
							and vulnerabilities.  totalResults indicates the 
							total number of CVE records that match the request parameters.  
							If the value of totalResults is greater than the value of resultsPerPage, 
							there are more records than could be returned by a single API 
							response and additional requests must update the startIndex 
							to get the remaining records.
						

							The best, most efficient, practice for keeping up to date with 
							the NVD is to use the date range parameters to request 
							only the CVEs that have been modified since your last request. 
						


Request 20 CVE records, beginning at index 0 and ending at index 19

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0/?resultsPerPage=20&startIndex=0




Request the CVE records, beginning at index 20 and ending at index 39

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0/?resultsPerPage=20&startIndex=20





sourceIdentifier optional

{sourceIdentifier}

	
							This parameter returns CVE where the exact value of {sourceIdentifier}
							appears as a data source in the CVE record. The CVE API returns {sourceIdentifier} 
							values within the descriptions object.
							The Source API returns detailed information 
							on the organizations that provide the data contained in the NVD dataset, including every valid 
							{sourceIdentifier} value. 
						


Request all CVE with the data source "cve@mitre.org"

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?sourceIdentifier=cve@mitre.org





versionEnd & versionEndType optional

{ending version}


including
excluding

	
							The virtualMatchString parameter may be combined with versionEnd and versionEndType 
							to return only the CVEs associated with CPEs in specific version ranges.  
						
	
							If filtering by the ending version, versionEnd, versionEndType, and virtualMatchString 
							are required.	
							Requests that include versionEnd cannot include a version component in the virtualMatchString.
						


Request all CVE affiliated with version 2.6 of a specific CPE 

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?virtualMatchString=cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel&versionStart=2.6&versionStartType=including&versionEnd=2.7&versionEndType=excluding





versionStart & versionStartType optional

{starting version}


including
excluding

	
							The virtualMatchString parameter may be combined with versionStart and versionStartType 
							to return only the CVEs associated with CPEs in specific version ranges.  
						
		
							If filtering by the starting version, versionStart, versionStartType, and virtualMatchString 
							are required.	
							Requests that include versionStart cannot include a version component in the virtualMatchString.
						


Request all CVE affiliated with versions 2.2 through 2.5.x of a specific CPE 

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?virtualMatchString=cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel&versionStart=2.2&versionStartType=including&versionEnd=2.6&versionEndType=excluding





virtualMatchString optional

{cpe match string}

	
							This parameter filters CVE more broadly than cpeName. 														 
							The exact value of {cpe match string} is compared against the CPE Match Criteria 
							present on CVE applicability statements. 
						

							CPE Match Criteria comes in two forms: CPE Match Strings and CPE Match String Ranges.
							Both are abstract concepts that are then correlated to CPE URIs in the Official CPE 
							Dictionary. Unlike a CPE Name, match strings and match string ranges do not require 
							a value in the part, vendor, product, or version components. The CVE API returns 
							CPE Match Criteria within the configurations object. 	
						

							CPE Match String Ranges are only supported for the version component and only when 
							virtualMatchString is combined with 
							versionStart, versionStartType, and/or versionEnd, both versionEndType.
						

cpeName is a simpler alternative for many use cases. When both cpeName 
							and virtualMatchString are provided, only the cpeName is used.				
						


Request all CVE where the associated CPE's language component denotes the German language version of a product.

				Response 
			


CVE API JSON Schema

				The API response may contain up to four JSON schema that define the structure of the response data.
				Each of the documents below describe a different aspect of the response but all include information 
				on data types, regex patterns, maximum character length, and other information that can support 
				developers and database administrators looking to create their own local repository.
			

CVE API Schema
CVSSv3.1 Schema
CVSSv3.0 Schema
CVSSv2.0 Schema

Response Details

				The CVE API returns seven primary objects in the body of the response: 
				resultsPerPage, startIndex, 
				totalResults, format, 
				version, timestamp, 
				and vulnerabilities.           
			

				The totalResults object indicates the number of CVE that 
				match the request criteria, including all parameters. If the value of 
				totalResults is greater than the value of 
				resultsPerPage, then additional requests are necessary to 
				return the remaining CVE. The parameter startIndex may be 
				used in subsequent requests to identify the starting point for the next request. More 
				information and the best practices for using  resultsPerPage  
				and startIndex are described above.
			

				The format and version objects 
				identify the format and version of the API response. timestamp  
				identifies when the response was generated.
			

				The vulnerabilities object contains an array of objects equal
				to the number of CVE returned in the response and is sorted in ascending order by the 
				published property of the cve object.  
				The cve object is explained in more detail below. 
			

				JSON response objects are either optional or required.  Required response objects are always returned 
				by the API and may contain fields without data.  Optional response objects are only returned when 
				they contain data.  For example, the cvssMetricV3 object is optional.  
				CVSSv3.0 was released in 2016, thus most CVE published before 2016 do not include the 
				cvssMetricV3 object. The exception are CVE published before 2016 that 
				were later reanalyzed or modified.  These CVE may have been updated to include CVSSv3 information.   
				If the CVE was updated in this way,	the API response would include this optional information.
			
cve  required 

				This object always contains the CVE-ID, sourceIdentifier an identifier for the source of the CVE, 
				published the date and time that the CVE was published to the NVD, 
				lastModified the date and time that the CVE was last modified, and 
				vulnStatus the CVE's status in the NVD.  									 
			

				This object also contains seven optional fields.  The
				evaluatorComment, evaluatorImpact, 
				and evaluatorSolution provide additional context to help understand 
				the vulnerability or its analysis. If the CVE is listed in CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) 
				Catalog cisaExploitAdd, cisaActionDue,  
				cisaRequiredAction, and cisaVulnerabilityName
				 will be returned. The cisaActionDue 
				object indicates the date by which all federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) agencies are required 
				to complete the cisaRequiredAction under Binding Operational Directive 
				(BOD) 22-01, Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities. Although not bound 
				by BOD 22-01, every organization, including those in state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) 
				governments and private industry can significantly strengthen their security and resilience posture 
				by prioritizing the remediation of the vulnerabilities listed in the KEV catalog as well.
			

				This object may also contain up to seven objects with additional nested information.  
				The cveTags, description, 
				metrics, weaknesses, 
				configurations, references, 
				and vendorComments objects are explained in more detail below.     
			



 cveTags optional

 weaknesses optional

							This object contains information on specific weaknesses, 
							considered the cause of the vulnerability.  Please note, a CVE that is Awaiting 
							Analysis, Undergoing Analysis, or Rejected may not include the weaknesses
							object.
						

source identifies the organization 
							that provided the weakness information and type  
							identifies whether the organization is a primary or secondary source.  Primary 
							sources include the NVD and CNA who have reached the provider level in CVMAP.  
							10% of provider	level submissions are audited by the NVD.  If a submission has 
							been audited the NVD will appear as the primary source and the provider level 
							CNA will appear as the secondary source.

 configurations optional

							This object contains the CVE applicability statements that convey which product, or 
							products, are associated with the vulnerability according to the NVD analysis.  Please 
							note, a CVE that is Awaiting Analysis, Undergoing Analysis, or Rejected will not 
							include the configurations object.
						

							Like the JSON response, configurations are a hierarchical 
							data structure that always contain one or more CPE match strings.   
							Each object within configurations includes either 
							an OR- or an AND-operator (and in rare cases a NEGATE flag) to covey the logical 
							relationship of the CPE or child objects within. For example, if the vulnerability 
							exists only when both CPE products are present, the operator is “AND”. If the 
							vulnerability exists if either CPE is present, then the operator is “OR”.
    					

							The cpeMatch object contains the CPE Match Criteria, 
							the criteria's unique identifier, and a statement of whether the criteria is vulnerable. 
							The matchCriteriaId's corresponding {uuid} 
							may be used with either the  
							Match Criteria API's matchCriteriaId
							or the  
							CPE API's matchCriteriaId
							parameters.

CVE Change History API

				The CVE Change History API is used to easily retrieve information on changes made 
				to a single CVE or a collection of CVE from the NVD. This API provides additional 
				transparency to the work of the NVD, allowing users to easily monitor when and 
				why vulnerabilities change.	
			

				The NVD has existed in some form 
				since 1999  
				and the fidelity of this information has changed several times over the decades. 
				Earlier records may not contain the level of detail available with more recent CVE records.
				This is most apparent on CVE records prior to 2015. 
			

				The URL stem for retrieving CVE information is shown below.
			



Base URL

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cvehistory/2.0




			Parameters
		





changeStartDate & changeEndDate optional

{start date}
{end date}

	
						These parameters return any CVE that changed during the  			
						specified period. Please note, this is different from  
						the last modified date parameters used with other APIs. 
						If filtering by the change date, both 
						changeStartDate and changeEndDate are required.  
						The maximum allowable range when using any date range parameters 
						is 120 consecutive days. 
					

						Values must be entered in the extended ISO-8601 date/time format:							
					
[YYYY][“-”][MM][“-”][DD][“T”][HH][“:”][MM][“:”][SS][Z]

						The "T" is a literal to separate the date from the time. The Z indicates 
						an optional offset-from-UTC. Please note, if a positive Z value is used 
						(such as +01:00 for Central European Time) then the "+" should be encoded 
						in the request as "%2B". The user agent may handle this encoding automatically. 
					


Request all CVE change histories between the start and end datetimes

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cvehistory/2.0/?changeStartDate=2021-08-04T13:00:00.000%2B01:00&changeEndDate=2021-10-22T13:36:00.000%2B01:00





cveId optional

{CVE-ID}

	
						This parameter returns the complete change history for a specific vulnerability 
						identified by its unique Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures identifier 
						(the CVE ID).  cveId will not accept {CVE-ID} 
						for vulnerabilities not yet published in the NVD.   																				 
					


Request the change history for a specific CVE using its CVE-ID

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cvehistory/2.0?cveId=CVE-2019-1010218





eventName optional



CVE Received
An approved source has published the CVE record
									to the CVE List and the NVD has processed the record and any supported data types. 
									NVD analysis has not yet occurred on the CVE record.
								


Initial Analysis
The NVD performs its initial analysis 
									to enrich the CVE record with reference tags, CVSS base metrics, CWE, 
									and CPE applicability statements.


Reanalysis
The NVD performs further analysis resulting 
									in some modification to the CVE record.


CVE Modified
An approved source modifies a CVE record 
									published in the NVD.  The modification's source is identified 
									on the details page in the event name and in the API response by the value 
									of the sourceIdentifier.


Modified Analysis
After an approved source modified a 
									previously analyzed CVE record, the NVD performs further analysis.
							

CVE Translated
An approved translator provides a 
									non-English translation for the CVE record.


Vendor Comment
The NVD updates the CVE record with 
									additional information from the product vendor.


CVE Source Update
The NVD updates the information on a source 
									that contributed to the CVE record.


CPE Deprecation Remap
The NVD updates the match criteria associated 
									with the CVE record based on changes to the CPE dictionary. This event occurs separate 
									from analysis.


CWE Remap
The NVD updates the weakness associated with 
									the CVE record. This event occurs separate from analysis.
 
Reference Tag Update
The NVD updates the Reference Tag of a URL associated 
									with the CVE record. This event occurs separate from analysis.


CVE Rejected
An approved source rejects a CVE record.
									Rejections occurs for one or more reasons, including duplicate CVE entries, 
									withdraw by the original requester, incorrect assignment, or some other 
									administrative reason.


CVE Unrejected
An approved source re-published a CVE record 
									previously marked rejected.


CVE CISA KEV Update
An update to CISA KEV information was performed for an associated CVE.
								



	
						This parameter returns all CVE associated with a specific 
						type of change event. 
						Please note, each request can contain only one value for the 
						eventName parameter.  Empty spaces in the URL 
						should be encoded in the request as "%20". The user agent may 
						handle this encoding automatically.
					


Request all CVE that were rejected in the specified time frame

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cvehistory/2.0?eventName=CVE%20Rejected&changeStartDate=2021-08-04T13:00:00.000%2B01:00&changeEndDate=2021-10-22T13:36:00.000%2B01:00





resultsPerPage optional

{page limit}

	
						This parameter specifies the maximum number of change events to be returned 
						in a single API response. For network considerations, the default value and maximum 
						allowable limit is 5,000.
					




startIndex optional

{offset}

	
						This parameter specifies the index of the first change events to be returned in 
						the response data. The index is zero-based, meaning the first change events
						is at index zero.  
					

						The CVE Change History API returns four primary objects in the response body that are 
						used for pagination:
						resultsPerPage, startIndex, totalResults, 
						and cveChanges.  totalResults indicates the 
						total number of change events that match the request parameters.  
						If the value of totalResults is greater than the value of resultsPerPage, 
						there are more events than could be returned by a single API 
						response and additional requests must update the startIndex 
						to get the remaining events.
					


Request 20 change events, beginning at index 0 and ending at index 19

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cvehistory/2.0/?resultsPerPage=20&startIndex=0








			Response 
		


CVE Change History API JSON Schema

			This API response includes only one JSON schema for defining the structure of the response data.
			The following document includes information 
			on data types, regex patterns, maximum character length, and similar information that can support 
			developers and database administrators looking to create their own local repository.
		

CVE Change History API Schema

Response Details

			The CVE Change History API returns seven primary objects in the body of the response: 			
			resultsPerPage, startIndex, 
			totalResults, format, 
			version, timestamp, 
			and cveChanges.
		

			The totalResults object indicates the number of change events
			that match the request, including all parameters. If the value of 
			totalResults is greater than the value of 
			resultsPerPage, then additional requests are necessary to 
			return the remaining records. The parameter startIndex may be 
			used in subsequent requests to identify the starting point for the next request. More 
			information and the best practices for using  resultsPerPage  
			and startIndex are described above.
		

			The format and version objects 
			identify the format and version of the API response. timestamp  
			identifies when the response was generated.
		

			The cveChanges object contains an array of objects equal
			to the number of change events returned in the response and is sorted in ascending order 
			by the created property of the change object.
			The change object is explained in more detail below.     
		

			JSON response objects are either optional or required.  Required response objects are always returned 
			by the API and may contain fields without data.  Optional response objects are only returned when 
			they contain data.
		
change  required  

			This object contains the following required data: the CVE-ID, the type of change event, 
			a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) for the change event, the 
			source of the 
			change event, the date and time that the CVE was modified, and an array of data 		 													
			containing any additional details.  			 
		

			The details array is a required object.  It will appear 
			whether or not the array contains additional data.
