Running Puppet commands on Windows



Puppet was originally designed to run on *nix systems, so its commands generally act the way *nix admins expect. Because Windows systems work differently, there are a few extra
        things to keep in mind when using Puppet
        commands.
Supported commands
Not all Puppet commands work on Windows. Notably, Windows nodes can’t run the puppet server or puppetserver ca
                commands.
The following commands are designed for use on Windows: 


puppet
                                    agent




puppet
                                    apply




puppet
                                    module




puppet
                                    resource




puppet
                                    config




puppet
                                    lookup




puppet
                                    help




Running Puppet's commands
The
                installer adds Puppet commands to the PATH. After
                installing, you can run them from any command prompt
                (cmd.exe) or PowerShell prompt.
Open a new
                command prompt after installing. Any processes that were already running before you
                ran the installer do not pick up the changed PATH value.
Running with administrator
                privileges
You usually want to run Puppet’s commands with administrator
                privileges.

Puppet has two privilege modes: 
Run with limited privileges, only
                            manage certain resource types, and use a user-specific  
confdir
 and   codedir 

Run with administrator privileges,
                            manage the whole system, and use the system  
confdir
and  
                                codedir 



On *nix systems, Puppet defaults to running with limited privileges,
                when not run by root, but can have its privileges raised with the
                standard sudo command.

Windows systems don’t use sudo, so escalating
                privileges works differently.
Newer versions of Windows manage security with User Account Control
                (UAC), which was added in Windows 2008 and Windows Vista. With UAC, most programs run by
                administrators still have limited privileges. To get administrator privileges, the
                process has to request those privileges when it starts.
To
                run Puppet's commands in adminstrator mode, you must
                first start a Powershell command prompt with administrator privileges.
Right-click the Start (or apps screen tile) -> Run as administrator: 

Click Yes to allow the command prompt to run with elevated privaleges:
                    

The title bar on the comand prompt window begins with
                    Administrator. This
                means Puppet commands that run from that window can
                manage the whole system. 



The Puppet Start menu items


Puppet’s installer adds a folder of shortcut items to the
            Start Menu.



These items aren’t necessary for working with Puppet, because Puppet
            agent runs a normal  Windows service and the Puppet commands
            work from any command or PowerShell prompt. They’re provided solely as conveniences. 
The Start
            menu items do the following: 
Run Facter

This shortcut requests UAC elevation and, using the CLI,
                        runs  Facter with administrator privileges. 
Run Puppet agent
This shortcut requests UAC elevation and, using the CLI,
                        performs a single Puppet agent command with
                        administrator privileges.
Start Command Prompt with Puppet

This shortcut starts a normal command prompt with the
                        working directory set to Puppet's program
                        directory. The CLI window icon is also set to the Puppet logo. This shortcut was particularly
                        useful in previous versions of Puppet, before
                            Puppet's commands were added to the PATH
                        at installation time. 
Note: This
                            shortcut does not automatically request UAC elevation; just
                            like with a normal command prompt, you'll need to right-click the icon
                            and choose Run as
                                administrator.





Configuration settings

Configuration settings can be viewed and modified using
        the CLI.
To get configuration settings, run: puppet agent --configprint <SETTING>
To set configuration settings, run: puppet config set <SETTING VALUE> --section
                <SECTION>
When running Puppet commands on Windows, note the following:

The location of puppet.conf depends
                        on whether the process is running as an administrator or not.
Specifying file owner, group, or mode
                        for file-based settings is not supported on Windows.
The puppet.conf configuration
                        file supports Windows-style CRLF line endings
                        as well as *nix-style LF line endings. It does
                        not support Byte Order Mark (BOM). The file encoding must either be UTF-8 or
                        the current Windows encoding, for example,
                            Windows-1252 code page.
Common configuration settings
                            are certname, server, and runinterval.
You must restart the Puppet agent service after making any changes
                        to Puppet’s runinterval config file
                        setting.
