          [Win32] long path name support [Bug #12551]
        

Browse files
Browse the repository at this point in the history

Implement long path support on Windows by applying Microsoft's
recommended application manifest.

To make this work on both Visual C++ and MinGW, include the manifest as
a resource when generating the resource files. This way it will be
embedded into the executables generated by both compilers.

It's important for the manifest resource to have ID 1, otherwise GCC
will embed a default manifest.

Note that in addition to this, the user needs to have [long paths enabled]
either by modifying the registry or by enabling a group policy.

[long paths enabled]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation?tabs=cmd#enable-long-paths-in-windows-10-version-1607-and-later
