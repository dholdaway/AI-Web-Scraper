The roles and profiles method 

The roles and profiles
        method is the most reliable way to build reusable, configurable, and refactorable system
        configurations. 
It's not a straightforward recipe: you must think hard about the
            nature of your infrastructure and your team. It's also not a final state: expect to
            refine your configurations over time. Instead, it's an approach to designing your infrastructure's interface — sealing away incidental
            complexity, surfacing the significant complexity, and making sure your data behaves
            predictably.
Building configurations without roles and profiles
                
Without roles and profiles, people typically build
                system configurations in their node classifier or main manifest, using Hiera to handle tricky inheritance problems. A
                standard approach is to create a group of similar nodes and assign classes to it,
                then create child groups with extra classes for nodes that have additional needs.
                Another common pattern is to put everything in Hiera,
                using a very large hierarchy that reflects every variation in the
                infrastructure.
If this works for you, then it works! You
                might not need roles and profiles. But most people find direct building gets
                difficult to understand and maintain over time.


Configuring roles and profiles 

Roles and profiles are two
      extra layers of indirection between your node classifier and your component modules. 
The roles and profiles method separates your code into three levels:

Component modules — Normal modules that manage one particular technology, for example
        puppetlabs/apache.
Profiles — Wrapper classes that use multiple component modules to configure a layered
        technology stack.
Roles — Wrapper classes that use multiple profiles to build a complete system
        configuration.

These extra layers of indirection might seem like they add complexity, but they give you a
      space to build practical, business-specific interfaces to the configuration you care most
      about. A better interface makes hierarchical data easier to use, makes system configurations
      easier to read, and makes refactoring easier.

In short, from top to bottom:

Your node classifier assigns one role class to a group of nodes. The role
        manages a whole system configuration, so no other classes are needed. The node classifier
        does not configure the role in any way.
That role class declares some profile classes with include,
        and does nothing else. For example:
          class role::jenkins::primaryserver {
    include profile::base
    include profile::server
    include profile::jenkins::primaryserver
  }           



Each profile configures a layered technology stack, using multiple component modules and
        the built-in resource types. (In the diagram,
          profile::jenkins::primaryserver uses puppet/jenkins, puppetlabs/apt, a
        home-built backup module, and some package and file
        resources.)
Profiles can take configuration data from the console, Hiera, or Puppet lookup. (In the diagram, three different
        hierarchy levels contribute data.)
Classes from component modules are always declared via a profile, and never assigned
        directly to a node. 
If a component class has parameters, you specify them in the profile; never use
              Hiera or Puppet lookup
            to override component class params. 





Rules for profile classes 

There are rules for writing profile
                              classes.

Make sure you can safely
                                                  include any profile multiple times —
                                                  don't use resource-like declarations on them.
Profiles can include
                                                  other profiles.
Profiles own all the class
                                                  parameters for their component classes. If the
                                                  profile omits one, that means you definitely want
                                                  the default value; the component class shouldn't
                                                  use a value from Hiera data. If you need
                                                  to set a class parameter that was omitted
                                                  previously, refactor the profile.
There are three ways a
                                                  profile can get the information it needs to
                                                  configure component classes: 
If your business always
                                                  uses the same value for a given parameter,
                                                  hardcode it.
If you can't hardcode it,
                                                  try to compute it based on information you already
                                                  have.
Finally, if you can't
                                                  compute it, look it up in your data. To reduce
                                                  lookups, identify cases where multiple parameters
                                                  can be derived from the answer to a single
                                                  question.

This is a game of
                                                  trade-offs. Hardcoded parameters are the easiest
                                                  to read, and also the least flexible. Putting
                                                  values in your Hiera data is very flexible, but can be very
                                                  difficult to read: you might have to look through
                                                  a lot of files (or run a lot of lookup commands)
                                                  to see what the profile is actually doing. Using
                                                  conditional logic to derive a value is a
                                                  middle-ground. Aim for the most readable option
                                                  you can get away with.




Rules for role classes 

There are rules for writing role classes.

The only thing roles should do is declare profile classes
                    with include. Don't declare any
                    component classes or normal resources in a role.Optionally, roles can use conditional logic to decide which profiles to
                        use. 

Roles should not have any class parameters of their
                    own.
Roles should not set class parameters for any profiles.
                    (Those are all handled by data lookup.)
The name of a role should be based on your business's conversational name
                    for the type of node it manages.This means that if you regularly call a
                        machine a "Jenkins primary server," it makes sense to write a role named
                            role::jenkins::primaryserver. But if you call it a "web
                        server," you shouldn't use a name like role::nginx — go
                        with something like role::web instead.




Methods for data lookup 

Profiles usually require some amount of configuration, and
        they must use data lookup to get it.
This profile uses the automatic class parameter lookup to request
            data. 
# Example Hiera data
profile::jenkins::jenkins_port: 8000
profile::jenkins::java_dist: jre
profile::jenkins::java_version: '8'
 
# Example manifest
class profile::jenkins (
  Integer $jenkins_port,
  String  $java_dist,
  String  $java_version
) {
# ...
This profile omits the parameters and uses the lookup
            function:class profile::jenkins {
  $jenkins_port = lookup('profile::jenkins::jenkins_port', {value_type => String, default_value => '9091'})
  $java_dist    = lookup('profile::jenkins::java_dist',    {value_type => String, default_value => 'jdk'})
  $java_version = lookup('profile::jenkins::java_version', {value_type => String, default_value => 'latest'})
  # ...

In general, class parameters are preferable to lookups. They integrate
            better with tools like Puppet strings, and they're a
            reliable and well-known place to look for configuration. But using lookup is a fine approach if you aren't comfortable
            with automatic parameter lookup. Some people prefer the full lookup key to be written in
            the profile, so they can globally grep for it.
