Refactoring legacy 3.x functions

If you have Ruby functions
    written with the legacy 3.x API, refactor them to ensure that they work correctly with current
    versions of Puppet.
Refactoring legacy functions improves functionality and prevents errors.
      At minimum, refactor any extra methods in your 3.x functions, because these no longer work in
        Puppet. 
Extra methods
Legacy functions that contain methods defined inside the function body or outside of the
        function return an error, such as:
raise SecurityError, _("Illegal method definition of method '%{method_name}' on line %{line}' in legacy function") % { method_name: mname, line: mline }
To fix these errors, refactor your 3.x functions to the 4.x function API, where defining
        multiple methods is permitted. 
For example, the legacy function below has been refactored into the modern API, with the
        following changes:


Documentation for the function is now a comment before the call to create_function.




The default dispatcher dispatches all given arguments to a method with the same name as
            the function.


The extra_method has not been moved, but is legal in
            the modern API.


Not visible in the code sample, the function has been moved from lib/puppet/parser/functions to lib/puppet/functions.


3.x API function:
module Puppet::Parser::Functions
  newfunction(:sample, :type => :rvalue, :doc => <<-EOS
    The function's documentation
  EOS
  ) do |arguments|
    "the returned value"
  end

  def extra_method()
  end
end

4.x API function:

# The function's documentation
Puppet::Functions.create_function(:sample) do

  def sample(*arguments)
    "the returned value"
  end

  def extra_method()
  end
end


Function call forms
Change all function calls from the form function_*** to use
        the method call_function(name, args).
The function_*** form applies only to functions implemented
        in the 3.x API, so function with calls in that form can not call any function that has moved
        to the 4.x API. 
For example, a 3.x
        function:function_sprintf("%s", "example")

The refactored 4.x
        function:call_function('sprintf', "%s", "example")




:rvalue specification 
The 3.x API differentiated between functions returning a value (:type => :rvalue) and functions that did not return a value (:type => :statement). In the 4.x API, there is no such
        distinction. If you are refactoring a function where :rvalue =>
          true, you do not need to make any changes. If you are refactoring a function
        where :rvalue => false, make sure the function returns
          nil.

Data values
The 4.x function API allows certain data values, such as Regexp, Timespan, and Timestamp. However, the 3.x API transformed these and similar data values into
        strings.
 Review the logic in your refactored function with this in mind: instead of checking for
        empty strings, the function checks for nil. The function
        uses neither empty strings nor the :undef symbol in returned
        values to denote undef; again, use nil instead.
For String, Integer,
          Float, Array, Hash, and Boolean values, you do
        not need to make changes to your 3.x functions.

Documentation
The 4.x API supports Markdown and Puppet Strings documentation
        tags to document functions, including individual parameters and returned values. See the
          
Strings documentation page for details about the
        correct format and style for documentation comments.

Namespacing
Namespace your function to the module in which it is defined, and update manifests that use
        it.
 The function name is in the format module_name::function_name. For example, if the module name is mymodule:

# The function's documentation
Puppet::Functions.create_function(:'mymodule::sample') do

  def sample(*arguments)
    "the returned value"
  end

  def extra_method()
  end
end

The default dispatch uses the last part of the name when dispatching to a method in the
        function, so you only have to change the module namespace in the function's full name. You
        must also move the file containing the function to the correct location for 4.x API
        functions, mymodule/lib/puppet/functions.
