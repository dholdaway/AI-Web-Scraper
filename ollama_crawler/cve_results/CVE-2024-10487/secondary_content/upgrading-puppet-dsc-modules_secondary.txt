Upgrading Puppet DSC modules 
The Puppet.dsc
PowerShell module is the third Puppet DSC module. The puppetlabs-dsc module
        is now deprecated and the puppetlabs-dsc_lite module is for advanced use
        cases only. To upgrade to the Puppet.dsc module, follow the upgrading
        instructions below.

Upgrade from the puppetlabs-dsc module



To upgrade from the puppetlabs-dsc module, do the
                following:



Remove the puppetlabs-dsc module from your Puppetfile.


Replace the puppetlabs-dsc module with declarations for each
                    of the modules you want.


Optional: 
To avoid any future code changes, pin the DSC modules to the versions that
                    shipped in the latest release of puppetlabs-dsc. Note that a
                    benefit of the new module is that you do not need to include every DSC
                    resource.


Choose only the resources you need from the following list and
                    declare them in your Puppetfile:

mod 'dsc-xdefender', '0.2.0-0-0'
mod 'dsc-xdhcpserver', '2.0.0-0-0'
mod 'dsc-xdisk', '1.0.0-0-0'
mod 'dsc-xdismfeature', '1.3.0-0-0'
mod 'dsc-xdnsserver', '1.11.0-0-0'
mod 'dsc-xexchange', '1.27.0-0-0'
mod 'dsc-xfailovercluster', '1.12.0-0-0'
mod 'ddsc-xhyper_v', '3.16.0-0-0'
mod 'dsc-xinternetexplorerhomepage', '1.0.0-0-0'
mod 'dsc-xjea', '0.2.16-6-0'
mod 'dsc-xmysql', '2.1.0-0-0'
mod 'dsc-xpendingreboot', '0.4.0-0-0'
mod 'dsc-xphp', '1.2.0-0-0'
mod 'dsc-xpowershellexecutionpolicy', '3.1.0-0-0'
mod 'dsc-xpsdesiredstateconfiguration', '8.5.0-0-0'
mod 'dsc-xremotedesktopadmin', '1.1.0-0-0'
mod 'dsc-xremotedesktopsessionhost', '1.8.0-0-0'
mod 'dsc-xrobocopy', '2.0.0-0-0'
mod 'dsc-xscdpm', '1.2.0-0-0'
mod 'dsc-xscom', '1.3.3-0-0'
mod 'dsc-xscsma', '2.0.0-0-0'
mod 'dsc-xscspf', '1.3.1-0-0'
mod 'dsc-xscsr', '1.3.0-0-0'
mod 'dsc-xscvmm', '1.2.4-0-0'
mod 'dsc-xsmbshare', '2.1.0-0-0'
mod 'dsc-xsqlps', '1.4.0-0-0'
mod 'dsc-xtimezone', '1.8.0-0-0'
mod 'dsc-xwebadministration', '2.5.0-0-0'
mod 'dsc-xwebdeploy', '1.2.0-0-0'
mod 'dsc-xwindowseventforwarding', '1.0.0-0-0'
mod 'dsc-xwindowsrestore', '1.0.0-0-0'
mod 'dsc-xwindowsupdate', '2.7.0-0`0'
mod 'dsc-xwineventlog', '1.2.0-0-0'
mod 'dsc-xwordpress', '1.1.0-0-0'

Note: The underlying DSC versions are likely to have changed — you can update
                        the modules to the latest versions one at a time, while testing each change.
                        No code changes are required, except for DSC updates.





Upgrade from the puppetlabs-dsc_lite module



To upgrade from the puppetlabs-dsc_lite module, do
                the following:



Refactor your code base to declare the proper resources — dsc_<name of resource>. For example, change the
                    following code:

dsc {'Download WebContent Zip':
  resource_name => 'XRemoteFile',
  module        => 'PSDesiredStateConfiguration',
  properties    => {
    ensure          => 'present',
    destinationpath => $zipfile,
    uri             => $zipuri,
  }
}


To look like this:
dsc_xremotefile {'Download WebContent Zip':
  dsc_ensure          => 'present',
  dsc_destinationpath => $zipfile,
  dsc_uri             => $zipuri,
}



As you refactor each resource, add the required Puppet modules to your
                        Puppetfile.


After you remove the DSC Resources, remove the
                        puppetlabs-dsc_lite module and turn off any automation that
                    you are using to distribute DSC Resources.


Test your code base.


Note: The puppetlabs-dsc_lite module can coexist with the new
                        DSC module.
