group

Attributes
Providers
Provider Features

Description 

Manage groups. On most platforms this can only create groups.
Group membership must be managed on individual users.
On some platforms such as OS X, group membership is managed as an
attribute of the group, not the user record. Providers must have
the feature 'manages_members' to manage the 'members' property of
a group record.
Attributes 
group { 'resource title':
  name                 => # (namevar) The group name. While naming limitations vary by 
  ensure               => # Create or remove the group.  Default: `present`  
  allowdupe            => # Whether to allow duplicate GIDs.  Default...
  attribute_membership => # AIX only. Configures the behavior of the...
  attributes           => # Specify group AIX attributes, as an array of...

  forcelocal           => # Forces the management of local accounts when...
  gid                  => # The group ID.  Must be specified numerically....
  ia_load_module       => # The name of the I&A module to use to manage this

  provider             => # The specific backend to use for this `group...
  system               => # Whether the group is a system group with lower...
  # ...plus any applicable metaparameters.
}
name 

(Namevar: If omitted, this attribute's value defaults to the resource's title.)
The group name. While naming limitations vary by operating system,
it is advisable to restrict names to the lowest common denominator,
which is a maximum of 8 characters beginning with a letter.
Note that Puppet considers group names to be case-sensitive, regardless
of the platform's own rules; be sure to always use the same case when
referring to a given group.
(↑ Back to group attributes)
ensure 

(Property: This attribute represents concrete state on the target system.)
Create or remove the group.
Default: present
Allowed values:

present
absent

(↑ Back to group attributes)
allowdupe 

Whether to allow duplicate GIDs.
Default: false
Allowed values:

true
false
yes
no

(↑ Back to group attributes)
attribute_membership 

AIX only. Configures the behavior of the attributes parameter.

minimum (default) --- The provided list of attributes is partial, and Puppet
ignores any attributes that aren't listed there.
inclusive --- The provided list of attributes is comprehensive, and
Puppet purges any attributes that aren't listed there.

Default: minimum
Allowed values:

inclusive
minimum

(↑ Back to group attributes)
attributes 

(Property: This attribute represents concrete state on the target system.)
Specify group AIX attributes, as an array of 'key=value' strings. This
parameter's behavior can be configured with attribute_membership.
Requires features manages_aix_lam.
(↑ Back to group attributes)
auth_membership 

Configures the behavior of the members parameter.

false (default) --- The provided list of group members is partial,
and Puppet ignores any members that aren't listed there.
true --- The provided list of of group members is comprehensive, and
Puppet purges any members that aren't listed there.

Default: false
Allowed values:

true
false
yes
no

(↑ Back to group attributes)
forcelocal 

Forces the management of local accounts when accounts are also
being managed by some other Name Switch Service (NSS). For AIX, refer to the ia_load_module parameter.
This option relies on your operating system's implementation of luser* commands, such as luseradd , lgroupadd, and lusermod. The forcelocal option could behave unpredictably in some circumstances. If the tools it depends on are not available, it might have no effect at all.
Default: false
Allowed values:

true
false
yes
no

Requires features manages_local_users_and_groups.
(↑ Back to group attributes)
gid 

(Property: This attribute represents concrete state on the target system.)
The group ID.  Must be specified numerically.  If no group ID is
specified when creating a new group, then one will be chosen
automatically according to local system standards. This will likely
result in the same group having different GIDs on different systems,
which is not recommended.
On Windows, this property is read-only and will return the group's security
identifier (SID).
(↑ Back to group attributes)
ia_load_module 

The name of the I&A module to use to manage this group.
This should be set to files if managing local groups.
Requires features manages_aix_lam.
(↑ Back to group attributes)
members 

(Property: This attribute represents concrete state on the target system.)
The members of the group. For platforms or directory services where group
membership is stored in the group objects, not the users. This parameter's
behavior can be configured with auth_membership.
Requires features manages_members.
(↑ Back to group attributes)
provider 

The specific backend to use for this group resource. You will seldom need to specify this --- Puppet will usually discover the appropriate provider for your platform.
Available providers are:

aix
directoryservice
groupadd
ldap
pw
windows_adsi

(↑ Back to group attributes)
system 

Whether the group is a system group with lower GID.
Default: false
Allowed values:

true
false
yes
no

(↑ Back to group attributes)
Providers 

aix 

Group management for AIX.

Required binaries: /usr/sbin/lsgroup, /usr/bin/mkgroup, /usr/sbin/rmgroup, /usr/bin/chgroup
Confined to: operatingsystem == aix
Default for: ["operatingsystem", "aix"] == 
Supported features: manages_aix_lam, manages_members, manages_local_users_and_groups

directoryservice 

Group management using DirectoryService on OS X.

Required binaries: /usr/bin/dscl
Confined to: operatingsystem == darwin
Default for: ["operatingsystem", "darwin"] == 
Supported features: manages_members

groupadd 

Group management via groupadd and its ilk. The default for most platforms.
To use the forcelocal parameter, you need to install the libuser package (providing
/usr/sbin/lgroupadd and /usr/sbin/luseradd).
Required binaries: groupadd, groupdel, groupmod
ldap 

Group management via LDAP.
This provider requires that you have valid values for all of the
LDAP-related settings in puppet.conf, including ldapbase.  You will
almost definitely need settings for ldapuser and ldappassword in order
for your clients to write to LDAP.
Note that this provider will automatically generate a GID for you if you do
not specify one, but it is a potentially expensive operation, as it
iterates across all existing groups to pick the appropriate next one.
Confined to: feature == ldap, false == (Puppet[:ldapuser] == "")
pw 

Group management via pw on FreeBSD and DragonFly BSD.

Required binaries: pw
Confined to: operatingsystem == [:freebsd, :dragonfly]
Default for: ["operatingsystem", "[:freebsd, :dragonfly]"] == 
Supported features: manages_members

windows_adsi 

Local group management for Windows. Group members can be both users and groups.
Additionally, local groups can contain domain users.

Confined to: operatingsystem == windows
Default for: ["operatingsystem", "windows"] == 
Supported features: manages_members

Provider Features 

Available features:

manages_aix_lam --- The provider can manage AIX Loadable Authentication Module (LAM) system.
manages_local_users_and_groups --- Allows local groups to be managed on systems that also use some other remote Name Switch Service (NSS) method of managing accounts.
manages_members --- For directories where membership is an attribute of groups not users.
system_groups --- The provider allows you to create system groups with lower GIDs.

Provider support:

aix - manages aix lam, manages members, manages local users and groups
directoryservice - manages members
groupadd - No supported Provider features
ldap - No supported Provider features
pw - manages members
windows_adsi - manages members
