Resource collectors

Resource collectors select a group of resources by searching the attributes of each
      resource in the catalog, even resources which haven’t yet been declared at the time the
      collector is written. Collectors realize virtual resources, are used in chaining statements,
      and override resource attributes. Collectors have an irregular syntax that enables them to
      function as a statement and a value.
Syntax

User <| title == 'luke' |> # Collect a single user resource whose title is 'luke'
User <| groups == 'admin' |> # Collect any user resource whose list of supplemental groups includes 'admin'
Yumrepo['custom_packages'] -> Package <| tag == 'custom' |> # Creates an order relationship with several package resourcesThe
            general form of a resource collector is: 

A capitalized resource type name. This cannot be Class, and there is no way to collect classes. 



<|- An opening angle bracket (less-than
                     sign) and pipe character. 


Optionally, a search expression.



|> - A pipe character and closing angle
                     bracket (greater-than sign) 



Note: Exported resource collectors have a slightly different syntax; see
               below.

Using a special expression syntax, collectors search the values of resource titles and
            attributes. This resembles the normal syntax for Puppet
            expressions, but is not the same.


Note: Collectors can search only on attributes that are present in the
               manifests, and cannot read the state of the target system. For example, the collector
                  Package <| provider == yum |> collects only
               packages whose provider attribute is explicitly set
               to yum in the manifests. It does not match packages
               that would default to the yum provider based on the
               state of the target system.A collector with an empty search expression matches
            every resource of the specified resource type.
Use parentheses to improve readability, and to modify the priority and grouping of
               and and or operators.
            You can create complex expressions using four operators. 

== (equality search) 
This operator is non-symmetric: 

The left operand (attribute) is a string, and must be the name of a
                                 resource attribute or the word title (which searches on the resource’s title). If the
                              resource attribute name is a reserved word (for example, site, unit, or application), it must be in quotes.


The right operand (search key) must be a string, boolean, number, resource
                                 reference, or undef. The behavior
                              of arrays and hashes in the right operand is undefined in this version
                              of Puppet. 



For a given resource, this operator matches if the value of the attribute (or
                     one of the value’s members, if the value is an array) is identical to the
                     search key.

!= (non-equality search) 
This operator is non-symmetric: 

The left operand (attribute) is a string, and must be the name of a
                                 resource attribute or the word title (which searches on the resource’s title). If the
                              resource attribute name is a reserved word (for example, site, unit, or application), it must be in quotes.


The right operand (search key) must be a string, boolean, number, resource
                                 reference, or undef. The behavior
                              of arrays and hashes in the right operand is undefined in this version
                              of Puppet. 



For a given resource, this operator matches if the value of the attribute is
                     not identical to the search key.


Note: This operator always matches if the attribute’s value is an
                        array.


and

Both operands must be valid search expressions. For a given resource, this
                     operator matches if both of the operands match for that resource. This operator
                     has higher priority than or. 

or

Both operands must be valid search expressions. For a given resource, this
                     operator matches if either of the operands match for that resource. This
                     operator has lower priority than and. 



Location
Use resource collectors in a collector attribute block for amending resource attributes,
            or as the operand of a chaining statement, or as independent statements.
Collectors cannot be used in the following contexts: 

As the value of a resource attribute


As the argument of a function


Within an array or hash


As the operand of an expression other than a chaining statement




Tip: Resource collector expressions does not produce a directly assignable
            value. However, the query_resources function of the
               puppetdb_query module returns an array of resources.
            For more information, see PuppetDB query tools.

Behavior
A resource collector realizes any virtual resources matching its search expression.
            Empty search expressions match every resource of the specified resource type.


Note: A collector also collects and realizes any exported resources from the
               current node. When you use exported resources that you don’t want realized, exclude
               them from the collector’s search expression.

Collectors function as a value in two places: 

In a chaining statement, a collector acts as a proxy for every resource
                     (virtual or not) that matches its search expression. 


When given a block of attributes and values, a collector sets and overrides
                     those attributes for every resource (virtual or not) matching its search
                     expression. 





Note: Collectors used as values also realize any matching virtual resources.
               When you use virtualized resources, be careful when chaining collectors or using them
               for overrides.


Exported resource collectors
An exported resource collector uses a modified syntax that realizes exported resources
            and imports resources published by other nodes. 
To use exported resource collectors, enable catalog storage and searching (storeconfigs). See Exported resources for more details. To
            enable exported resources, follow the installation instructions and Puppet configuration instructions in the PuppetDB docs.
Like normal collectors, use exported resource collectors with attribute blocks and
            chaining statements.


Note: The search for exported resources also searches the catalog being
               compiled, to avoid having to perform an additional run before finding them in the
               store of exported resources.Exported resource collectors are identical to
            collectors, except that their angle brackets are
            doubled.Nagios_service <<| |>> # realize all exported nagios_service resourcesThe
            general form of an exported resource collector is: 

The resource type name, capitalized.


<<| — Two opening angle brackets
                  (less-than signs) and a pipe character. 

Optionally, a search expression. 


|>> — A pipe character and two closing
                  angle brackets (greater-than signs).
