Catalog
The catalog endpoint returns a catalog for the specified node name given the provided facts.
Find

Retrieve a catalog.
POST /puppet/v3/catalog/:nodename
GET /puppet/v3/catalog/:nodename?environment=:environment

Supported HTTP Methods
POST, GETSupported Response Formats
application/json, text/psonNotes

The POST and GET methods are functionally equivalent. Both provide the 3 parameters specified below: the POST in the
request body, the GET in the query string.
Puppet originally used GET; POST was added because some web servers have a maximum URI length of
1024 bytes (which is easily exceeded with the facts parameter).
The examples below use the POST method.
Parameters

Four parameters should be provided to the POST or GET:

environment: the environment name.
facts_format: must be application/json or pson.
facts: serialized JSON or PSON of the facts hash. Since facts can contain &, which
is also the HTTP query parameter delimiter, facts are doubly-escaped.
transaction_uuid: a transaction uuid identifying the entire transaction (shows up in the report as well).

Two optional parameters are required for static catalogs:

static_catalog: a boolean requesting a
static catalog if available; should always
be true.
checksum_type: a dot-separated list of checksum types supported by the agent, for use in file resources of a static
catalog. The order signifies preference, highest first.

Optional parameters that may be provided to the POST or GET:

configured_environment: the environment configured on the client. May be
provided to notify an ENC that the client requested a specific environment
which might differ from what the client believes is its current environment.
job_id: which orchestration job triggered this catalog request.
