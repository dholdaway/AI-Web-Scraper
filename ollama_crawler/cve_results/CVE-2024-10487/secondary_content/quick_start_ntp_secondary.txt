Manage an NTP service

Network Time Protocol (NTP) is one of the most crucial, yet easiest, services to
      configure and manage with Puppet, to properly synchronize time
      across all your nodes. Follow this guide to get started managing a NTP service using the Puppet
ntp module.
Before you begin
Ensure youâ€™ve already 
                    installed Puppet, and at least one  *nix agent. Also, log in as
                root or Administrator on your nodes.


The clocks on your servers are not inherently accurate. They need to
            synchronize with something to let them know what the right time is. NTP is a protocol
            that synchronizes the clocks of computers over a network. NTP uses Coordinated Universal
            Time (UTC) to synchronize computer clock times to within a millisecond.
Your entire datacenter, from the network to the applications, depends
            on accurate time for security services, certificate validation, and file sharing across
               Puppet agents. If the time is wrong, your Puppet primary server might mistakenly issue agent certificates
            from the distant past or future, which other agents treat as expired.
Using the Puppet NTP module, you can: 


Ensure time is correctly synced across all the servers in your
                  infrastructure.


Ensure time is correctly synced across your configuration
                  management tools.


Roll out updates quickly if you need to change or specify your
                  own internal NTP server pool.


This guide walks you through the following steps in setting up NTP
            configuration management:


Installing the puppetlabs-ntp module.


Adding classes to the default node in your main
                  manifest.


Viewing the status of your NTP service.


Using multiple nodes in the main manifest to configure NTP for
                  different permissions.




Note: You can add the NTP service to as many agents as
               needed. For simplicity, this guide describes adding it to only one.




The first step is installing the puppetlabs-ntp
               module. The puppetlabs-ntp module is part of the
                  supported
                  modules program; these modules are supported, tested, and maintained by Puppet. For more information on puppetlabs-ntp, see the  README. To
               install it, run:


puppet module install puppetlabs-ntp



The resulting output is similar to
               this:
 Preparing to install into /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules ...
    Notice: Downloading from http://forgeapi.puppetlabs.com ...
    Notice: Installing -- do not interrupt ...
    /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/production/modules
    â””â”€â”€ puppetlabs-ntp (v3.1.2)Thatâ€™s
               it! Youâ€™ve just installed the puppetlabs-ntp
               module.


The next step is adding classes from the NTP module to
               the main manifest.

The NTP module contains several classes. Classes are named chunks of Puppet code and are the primary means by which Puppet configures nodes. The NTP module contains the
                  following classes:


ntp: the main class, which includes all other NTP classes,
                        including the classes in this list.


ntp::install: handles the installation packages.


ntp::config: handles the configuration file.


ntp::service: handles the service.


Youâ€™re going to add the ntp class to the default
                  node in your main manifest. Depending on your needs or infrastructure, you might
                  have a different group that youâ€™ll assign NTP to, but you would take similar
                  steps.



From the command line on the primary server, navigate to the directory that contains
                     the main manifest: 


cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests




Use your text editor to open site.pp.


Add the following Puppet code to site.pp:


node default { 
  class { 'ntp':
        servers => ['nist-time-server.eoni.com','nist1-lv.ustiming.org','ntp-nist.ldsbc.edu']
  }
}


Note: If your site.pp file
                           already has a default node in it, add just the class and servers lines
                           to it. 

Note: For additional time server options, see the list at https://www.ntppool.org/.




On your agent, start a Puppet run: 


puppet agent -t


Your Puppet-managed node is now configured to use NTP. 




To check if the NTP service is running, run: 
puppet resource service ntpd
On Ubuntu operating systems, the service is ntp
               instead of ntpd. 
The result
                  looks like this:
                  service { 'ntpd':
  		  ensure => 'running',
 		  enable => 'true',
	}



If you want to configure the NTP service to run differently on different nodes, you
               can set up NTP on nodes other than default in the
                  site.pp file. 

In previous steps, youâ€™ve been configuring the default node. 
In the example below, two NTP servers (kermit and
                     grover) are configured to talk to outside time
                  servers. The other NTP servers (snuffie, bigbird, and hooper)
                  use those two primary servers to sync their time. 
One of the primary NTP servers, kermit, is very
                  cautiously configured â€” it canâ€™t afford outages, so itâ€™s not allowed to
                  automatically update its NTP server package without testing. The other servers are
                  more permissively configured.
The site.pp looks like this:
                  node "kermit.example.com" { 
  class { "ntp":
        servers            => [ '0.us.pool.ntp.org iburst','1.us.pool.ntp.org iburst','2.us.pool.ntp.org iburst','3.us.pool.ntp.org iburst'],
        autoupdate         => false,
        restrict           => [],
        service_enable     => true,
  }
}

node "grover.example.com" { 
  class { "ntp":
        servers            => [ 'kermit.example.com','0.us.pool.ntp.org iburst','1.us.pool.ntp.org iburst','2.us.pool.ntp.org iburst'],
        autoupdate         => true,
        restrict           => [],
        service_enable     => true,
  }
}

node "snuffie.example.com", "bigbird.example.com", "hooper.example.com" {
  class { "ntp":
        servers    => [ 'grover.example.com', 'kermit.example.com'],
        autoupdate => true,
        enable     => true,
  }
}

In this way, it is possible to configure NTP on multiple nodes to suit your
                  needs.
