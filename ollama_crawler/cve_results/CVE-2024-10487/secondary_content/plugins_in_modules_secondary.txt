Plug-ins in modules


Puppet supports several kinds of plug-ins, which are
        distributed in modules. These plug-ins enable features such as custom facts and functions
        for managing your nodes. Modules that you download from the Forge can include these kinds of plug-ins, and you can also
        develop your own.
When you install a module that contains plug-ins, they are
            automatically enabled. At the start of every Puppet run,
                Puppet Server loads all the plug-ins available in the
            environment's modulepath. Agents download those plug-ins, so module plug-ins are
            available for use on the first Puppet run after you install them in an environment.
 Plug-ins are available whether or not a node uses classes or defined
            types from a given module. In other words, even if you don't declare any classes from
            the stdlib module, nodes
            still use the stdlib
            custom facts. There is no way to exclude plug-ins in an environment in which they are
            installed.
If the agent and primary server are both running Puppet
            5.3.4 or newer, the agent also downloads any non-English translations included in the
            module.

Puppet supports several kinds of plug-ins. Puppet looks for each plug-in in a different subdirectory
            of the module. If you are adding plug-ins to a module, be sure to place them in the
            correct module subdirectory. In all cases, you must name files and additional
            subdirectories according to the plug-in type's loading requirements.

Important: Environments aren't completely isolated for certain kinds of plug-ins. If you
                    are using custom resource types or legacy custom functions, you can encounter
                    conflicts if your environments contain differing versions of a given plug-in.In
                    such cases, Puppet loads the first version it
                    encounters of the plug-in, and then continues to use that version for all
                    environments. 
To avoid plug-in conflicts for resource
                    types, use the puppet
                        generate types command as described in the environment isolation
                    documentation. To fix issues with legacy custom functions, rewrite them with the
                    modern API, which is not affected by this issue.



Module plug-in types

Modules can contain different types of plug-ins, each in a
        specific subdirectory.

Custom facts
Written in Ruby, facts can provide a
                                    specified piece of information about system state. For
                                    information about writing custom facts, see the Facter
custom facts documentation.
Agents only.
lib/facter


External facts
External facts provide a way to use
                                    arbitrary executables or scripts as facts, or set facts
                                    statically with structured data. For information about external
                                    facts, see the Facter
custom facts documentation.

Resource API
The Resource API is built on top of Puppet core and is useful
                                    for creating custom types and providers. For more information
                                    about the Resource API, visit Develop types and providers with the Resource API.
