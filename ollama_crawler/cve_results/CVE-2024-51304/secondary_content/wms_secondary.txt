Exhibit 99.1 ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER ANDFISCAL YEAR 2024 RESULTSHILLIARD, Ohio – (May 16, 2024) – Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc. (NYSE: WMS) (“ADS” or the “Company”), a leading provider of innovative water management solutions in the stormwater and onsite septic wastewater industries today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Results•Net sales increased 5.9% to $653.8 million•Net income increased 10.6% to $95.5 million•Diluted net income per share increased 14.5% to $1.21•Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) increased 11.2% to $191.2 millionFiscal 2024 Results•Net sales decreased 6.4% to $2,874.5 million•Net income increased 0.4% to $513.3 million•Diluted net income per share increased 6.1% to $6.45•Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) increased 2.1% to $922.9 million•Cash provided by operating activities increased $10.1 million to $717.9 million•Free cash flow (Non-GAAP) decreased $6.8 million to $534.1 millionScott Barbour, President and Chief Executive Officer of ADS commented, "Fiscal 2024 was ADS' ninth consecutive year of record profitability. Adjusted EBITDA increased 2% to $923 million due to the effective management of price/cost and strong operational execution. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 270 basis points to 32.1%, the highest annual profit margin in the Company’s history. The profitability results for the year are especially impressive given the weaker demand environment in the first half of the year, which drove a 6% overall decrease in net sales to $2.9 billion. We are proud of this year’s results and remain committed to driving above market performance as we advance the stormwater and onsite septic wastewater industries. Our focus on highly engineered solutions positions us as a pivotal player in successfully managing water – the world’s most precious resource." "The fourth quarter net sales and Adjusted EBITDA results came in above our guidance due to favorable volume growth in our core construction and agriculture markets, as well as productivity improvements from previous capital investments and continuous improvement programs. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to a new fourth quarter record of 29.2%, 140 basis points above the prior year." "In Fiscal 2025, we expect to see favorable demand drive volume growth in the residential and infrastructure markets, and stability in the non-residential construction market. Improved fixed cost absorption, increasing contributions from previous capital investments as well as effective management of price/cost should lead to healthy Adjusted EBITDA margins that at least equal Fiscal 2024 levels with potential for margin expansion." Barbour concluded, "More broadly, our success will continue to be driven by ADS’ position as a pure-play water company that provides advanced sustainable water management solutions to protect and manage water. In the face of changing climate patterns, ADS and Infiltrator solutions play a critical role in protecting communities. In 2023, there were 27 large-scale storm events that inflicted an estimated $88 billion in damage in the U.S. These events, ranging from severe storms and tropical cyclones to floods and droughts, have devastating impacts on our communities and highlight how existing stormwater infrastructure has not kept pace with increasing climate challenges. The products and solutions that we provide along with the expertise we have at the local level across North America are key to solving these issues for communities, providing ADS with a long runway of secular growth."  Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 ResultsNet sales increased $36.3 million, or 5.9%, to $653.8 million, as compared to $617.6 million in the prior year quarter. Domestic pipe sales increased $11.5 million, or 3.3%, to $358.7 million. Domestic allied products & other sales increased $4.3 million, or 2.9%, to $152.7 million. Infiltrator sales increased $18.4 million, or 21.0%, to $106.1 million. The overall increase in domestic net sales was 1The following information was filed by Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
