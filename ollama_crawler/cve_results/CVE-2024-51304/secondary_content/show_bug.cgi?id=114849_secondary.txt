Description


Matteo Settenvini





          2005-12-08 02:12:14 UTC
        

This bug's description is very simple: using OpenOffice.org 2.0 (I'm using KDE,
so widgets get its theme, if it helps), no tooltips pop up when standing still
on toolbar buttons or on any other element of the UI (e.g. the zoom factor at
the bottom of the page); not after 3 secs., a minute, or twenty hours.
Tooltips are one of those things you get so used to, that you appreciate only
when you completely miss them. Kudos to their inventor.

This is the binary version of OOo2.
Tooltips aren't showed for whatever theme I choose for KDE.

Please note this is not a minor flaw. How am I supposed to know what _every_
button in the toolbar does?? I'm getting mad, trying all the alternatives to a
button... on the up side, I'm learning to the heart where OOo2 features are
located. :-)

It works for me with the kde widgets. Perhaps you could post the output of
emerge --info, and indicate the version of kdelibs.

My kdelibs are now 3.5.0, but this bug happened also with the 3.4.x series.

There are two things that I consider the most likely causes of this. The first
one is compilation on "-O3", try "-O2" for kdelibs and openoffice. The second
one is that you build in italian, and there might not be italian tooltips. You
might want to add en to your linguas variable.

Build openoffice with "-O2"? Openoffice-*bin*???

Am I missing something? I thought that you didn't compile binary packages... I
mean: that's the whole point of having openoffice-2.0.0 != openoffice-bin-2.0.0:
twelve hours+ of compilation sorrow removed, and 5Gb of disk space you can
employ elsehow.

And please explain to me what gets better passing from -O2 to -O3 while
compiling kdelibs.

I don't think your advice on compilation flags would do something more than make
me waste three or four hours recompiling them. Anyway, all other conceivable
tooltips in the known KDE universe work as expected.

I'll give a shot on the LINGUAS var, but US English theoretically is *built-in*.
Mmmh... No need to emerge it again. Just doing from a console :
  LC_ALL="C" oowriter2 
is all I need to check if you're right...

--- twenty seconds later:

Nope, capt'n. No tooltips even with OOo2 in the default American English.

Sorry, I didn't notice that you were using the bin version. In general -O3 uses
a more agressive optimization level. This might expose bugs in the sourcecode
that don't get exposed at -O2. Further, most distributions use -O2, so gcc's -O2
gets more stress testing than -O3. Historically it has appeared that gcc has a
higher chance of hitting bugs with -O3 than with -O2. And gcc is certainly not
bugfree.

Is this still a bug for you with 2.0.1?




Comment 7

Yes, still no tooltips.

Can't reproduce this here, works fine for me with both english and italian (with the kde-widget-set / openoffice-bin), so this has to be a local problem.

You could try to redo your user install (remove $HOME/.ooo-2.0) or start OOo without KDE-support (oowriter2 --widgets-set none). Other than that, I'm afraid there is not a lot we can do here :(

Nor removing the .ooo* directories or using native widgets fixes this problem.
Still experiencing this bug with OpenOffice.org 2.0.1.
Sorry :-(

No need to be sorry, on the contrary, I'm sorry, but as it seems there is nothing we can do here, as this is not reproducable.

You might try to file it upstream (at openoffice.org), maybe someone there has heard about that, and this is mostly the right place for openoffice-bin anyway, as we only package there binary.
