Could you try rebuilding it with USE="-system-cairo" and see if it still crashes?

That did the trick! Though it would be nice to solve the issue with system libs...

(BTW, other crashes still happen: no console message, possibly again Bug 562930.)

Let me know if further action is needed on my side.

Unfortunately, system-cairo is a lost cause -- upstream is using a heavily patched fork based on cairo-1.9 while current upstream is somewhere around cairo-1.14, things have simply diverged too much.  However, the flag should be masked the same as other mozilla products so I'll do that now.

Thanks for reporting!
