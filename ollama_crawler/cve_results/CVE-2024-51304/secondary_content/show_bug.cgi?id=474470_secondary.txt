Hi,

Undertakers need to be able to touch the LDAP attributes of other developers for cleaning up/tiding up fields that developers do not bother to update themselves.
This will offload this task from the infra@ members.

Please consider adding a new 'undertakers' group in ldap.

hworang:
which fields do you want to be able to edit?

Oh this is nearly 2yo bug so I forgot the case that made me open it. Maybe it was an attempt to handle more retirement bits ourselves due to infra being unresponsive. I guess we can close this one until we find another case where editing LDAP fields would be useful.

Closing then, per hworang's comments.
