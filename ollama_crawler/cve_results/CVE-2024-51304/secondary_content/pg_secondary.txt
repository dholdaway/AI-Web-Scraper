News ReleaseThe Procter & Gamble CompanyOne P&G PlazaCincinnati, OH 45202P&G ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL YEAR 2024 RESULTSQ4 ’24: Net Sales 0%; Organic Sales +2%; Diluted EPS -7%; Core EPS +2%FY ’24: Net Sales +2%; Organic Sales +4%; Diluted EPS +2%; Core EPS +12%CINCINNATI, July 30, 2024 - The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) reported fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 results. “Fiscal year 2024 was another year of strong results for P&G,” said Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The team met or exceeded our going-in plans for organic sales growth, core EPS growth, cash generation and cash returned to shareowners in a challenging economic and geopolitical environment. As we look forward to fiscal 2025, we expect to deliver strong organic sales growth, EPS growth and free cash flow productivity – each in-line with our long-term growth algorithm. We remain committed to our integrated strategy – a focused product portfolio of daily use categories where performance drives brand choice, superiority (of product performance, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and consumer and customer value), productivity, constructive disruption and an agile and accountable organization – all aimed at delivering sustainable, balanced growth and value creation.”Fiscal Year ($ billions, except EPS)GAAP20242023% ChangeNon-GAAP*20242023% ChangeNet Sales$84.0$82.0+2%Organic Salesn/an/a+4%Diluted EPS$6.02$5.90+2%Core EPS$6.59$5.90+12%Fourth Quarter ($ billions, except EPS)GAAP20242023% ChangeNon-GAAP*20242023% ChangeNet Sales$20.5$20.6—%Organic Salesn/an/a+2%Diluted EPS$1.27$1.37(7)%Core EPS$1.40$1.37+2%* Please refer to Exhibit 1 - Non-GAAP Measures for the definition and reconciliation of these measures to the related GAAP measures.Fiscal Year 2024 ResultsThe Company reported fiscal year 2024 net sales of $84.0 billion, an increase of two percent versus the prior year. Organic sales, which excludes the impacts of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures, increased four percent. Higher pricing contributed four points of growth to organic sales. Shipment volumes and mix were unchanged versus the prior year. Diluted net earnings per share were $6.02, an increase of two percent versus prior year as the increase in net sales was partially offset by a non-cash charge to impair the carrying value of the Gillette trade name intangible asset and higher non-core restructuring charges. Core net earnings per share increased by 12% to $6.59. Currency-neutral core EPS increased 16% versus the prior year EPS. The Company generated operating cash flow of $19.8 billion and net earnings of $15.0 billion for the fiscal year. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 105%, which is calculated as operating cash flow less capital spending and certain other items, as a percentage of net earnings excluding the Gillette impairment charge and non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. The Company returned over $14 billion of value to shareholders in fiscal 2024 via $9.3 billion in dividend payments and $5 billion of share repurchases. With the dividend increase in April 2024, this marks the 68th consecutive year that P&G has increased its dividend and the 134th consecutive year that P&G has paid a dividend since its incorporation in 1890.April-June Quarter Results The Company reported fiscal year 2024 fourth quarter net sales of $20.5 billion, unchanged versus the prior year. A one percent increase in all-in volume and one percent increase due to higher pricing were offset by two percentage points of unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales, which excludes the impacts of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures, increased two percent. Excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, organic volume increased two percent. Mix had a neutral impact on sales growth for the quarter. Diluted net earnings per share were $1.27, a decrease of seven percent versus the prior year driven primarily by higher restructuring charges related to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. Core net earnings per share increased two percent to $1.40. Currency-neutral core EPS increased six percent versus the prior year EPS.Operating cash flow was $5.8 billion and net earnings were $3.1 billion, with adjusted free cash flow productivity of 148%.April-June Quarter Business DiscussionApril - June 2024VolumeForeign ExchangePriceMixOther (2)Net SalesOrganic VolumeOrganic SalesNet Sales Drivers (1)Beauty(1)%(3)%3%—%—%(1)%1%3%Grooming2%(7)%5%—%—%—%2%7%Health Care2%(1)%2%1%(1)%3%1%4%Fabric & Home Care2%(1)%(1)%1%(1)%—%3%2%Baby, Feminine & Family Care(1)%(2)%—%—%—%(3)%(1)%(1)%Total P&G1%(2)%1%—%—%—%2%2%(1)    Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied.(2)    Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales.•Beauty segment organic sales increased three percent versus year ago. Skin and Personal Care organic sales were unchanged as growth from increased pricing was offset by lower sales of the super-premium SK-II brand and in Greater China. Hair Care organic sales increased high single digits driven by increased pricing and favorable product mix due to growth of premium products.•Grooming segment organic sales increased seven percent versus year ago driven by increased pricing primarily in Latin America and volume growth from innovation.•Health Care segment organic sales increased four percent versus year ago. Oral Care organic sales increased high single digits due to premium product mix and volume growth in North America and Europe. Personal Health Care organic sales were unchanged as growth due to pricing and volume increases were offset by unfavorable mix due to lower incidence of cough and cold.•Fabric and Home Care segment organic sales increased two percent versus year ago. Fabric Care organic sales were unchanged as volume growth driven by North America and Europe was offset by lower pricing due to increased promotional spending. Home Care organic sales increased high single digits due to volume growth from innovation and favorable product mix.•Baby, Feminine and Family Care segment organic sales declined one percent versus year ago. Baby Care organic sales decreased mid-single digits due to volume declines from share losses, partially offset by premium product mix. Feminine Care organic sales increased low single digits driven by increased pricing and favorable product mix. Family Care organic sales were unchanged as volume growth was offset by unfavorable product mix.Diluted net earnings per share were $1.27 for the quarter, a decrease of seven percent versus the prior year driven primarily by higher restructuring charges related to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. Core net earnings per share increased by two percent to $1.40. Currency-neutral core EPS were up six percent versus the prior year EPS. Reported gross margin for the quarter increased 120 basis points versus year ago. Core gross margin for the quarter increased 140 basis points versus year ago, 180 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. The increase was driven by 210 basis points of productivity savings, 100 basis points of lower commodity costs and 40 basis points of pricing benefit. These were partially offset by 130 basis points of unfavorable product mix and 40 basis points of product/package reinvestments and other impacts. Reported selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) as a percentage of sales increased 260 basis points versus the prior year. Core selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) as a percentage of sales increased 240 basis points versus year ago and 240 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. The increase was driven by 300 basis points of marketing reinvestments and 30 basis points of wage inflation and overhead investments, partially offset by 40 basis points of productivity savings and 50 basis points of net sales growth leverage and other impacts.Reported operating margin for the quarter decreased 140 basis points due primarily to higher restructuring charges. Excluding 40 basis points of non-core restructuring charges, core operating margin for the quarter decreased 100 basis points versus the prior year, 60 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. Core operating margin included gross productivity savings of 250 basis points.Limited Market Portfolio RestructuringIn December 2023, the Company announced a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria, to address challenging macroeconomic and fiscal conditions. In connection with this announcement, the Company said that it expects to record incremental restructuring charges of $1.0 to 1.5 billion after tax, including foreign currency translation losses to be recognized upon the substantial liquidation of operations in the affected markets. As of June 30, 2024, the Company has substantially liquidated its operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria, and recorded a non-cash charge of $216 million after tax for accumulated currency translation losses. On July 1, 2024, the Company completed the divestiture of its business in Argentina. The Company expects to record a non-cash charge of approximately $750 million for accumulated currency translation losses in the first quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.Intangible Asset ImpairmentIn the October-December 2023 quarter of the fiscal year 2024, the Company recorded a $1.3 billion before tax ($1.0 billion after tax) non-cash impairment charge, on intangible assets acquired as part of the Company’s acquisition of The Gillette Company. The impairment charge arose from a reduction in the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of the non-core restructuring program described above. This impairment charge adjusted the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset to fair value.Fiscal Year 2025 GuidanceP&G expects fiscal year 2025 all-in sales growth in the range of two to four percent versus the prior year. Foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately one percentage point to all-in sales growth. The Company expects organic sales growth in the range of three to five percent.P&G expects fiscal 2025 diluted net earnings per share growth in the range of 10% to 12% versus fiscal 2024 GAAP EPS of $6.02. P&G expects its fiscal 2025 core net earnings per share growth in the range of five to seven percent versus fiscal 2024 core EPS of $6.59. This outlook equates to a range of $6.91 to $7.05 per share, with a mid-point estimate of $6.98, or an increase of 6%.The Company said its outlook estimates a net headwind of around $500 million after-tax from unfavorable commodity costs and unfavorable foreign exchange. The net headwind equates to a $0.20 per share for fiscal 2025, or a three percentage drag on core EPS growth. In addition, the prior fiscal year included benefits from minor brand divestitures and tax impacts that are unlikely to repeat to the same extent in the new fiscal year. Combined, these are an additional $0.10 to $0.12 headwind to core EPS.The Company is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP cash flow and tax rate measures without unreasonable efforts given the unpredictability of the timing and amounts of discrete items, such as acquisitions, divestitures, or impairments, which could significantly impact GAAP results. P&G said it expects a core effective tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 21% in fiscal 2025. Capital spending is estimated to be in the range of four to five percent of fiscal 2025 net sales.P&G said it expects adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% and expects to pay around $10 billion in dividends and to repurchase $6 to $7 billion of common shares in fiscal 2025.
