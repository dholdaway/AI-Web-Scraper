All the ebuilds in portage (1.6, 1.7, 1.8.3 and 1.9) have hardcoded --disable-static configure option. They should set it depending on the 'static-libs' use flag.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. USE="static-libs" emerge google-perftools
2. ls /usr/lib64/libtcmalloc.a
Actual Results:  
ls: cannot access /usr/lib64/libtcmalloc.a: No such file or directory


Expected Results:  
/usr/lib64/libtcmalloc.a

Do you have any particular reason for which we should be supporting the static libs configuration? Honestly I'd rather not open the door if there isn't a good reason to.

If you just need it locally, you can always use EXTRA_ECONF to --enable-static again.
