With javascript disabled the styles are broken. 
Here it is the pseudo-element :before on class .glyphicon-remove not showing the expected image of a very bold x which is displayed when javascript is on.  

Using javascript for that purpose is a very bad idea.

Cannot reproduce.

Your screenshot indicates that webfont support is broken in your browser and that is likely the cause of this.

'NoScript' which you are likely using is doing more than just fiddling with scripting, it for instance also disables @font-face.
