Hi, the initscript stops the jabberd process OK, but it ends with "!!" instead of "OK". Not sure why. Looking at jabberd initscripts in other distros, they tend to use "-o" ("oknodo"), and this works. So, I suggest changing the start-stop-daemon line to:

start-stop-daemon --stop -o -x /usr/bin/jabberd

It works ok for me on 3 different servers (and my dev box). Please reopen if you can provide method to reproduce it.
