upgrading from 4.14.-r1 up
[ebuild     U ] dev-db/mysql-4.1.19 [4.1.14-r1]
creates a n mysql which does not set socket file, so I can't get a connection.
downgrading agin to 4.1.14-r1 solves the problem


sh-3.1$ ls /var/run/mysqld/ -l
total 4
-rw-rw---- 1 mysql mysql 6 May 14 18:56 mysqld.pid
srwxrwxrwx 1 mysql mysql 0 May 14 18:56 mysqld.sock
sh-3.1$

is the mysql daemon started ? look at the log files for any error, the size of the innodb logs has changed preventing the daemon to start.
