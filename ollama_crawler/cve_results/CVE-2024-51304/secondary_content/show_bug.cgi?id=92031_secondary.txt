I installed a nvidia geforce fx 6200 oc, and tried using both the 6629 dirvers and the 7174 drivers.  X won't load at all with the 6629 drivers, and the with the 7174 drivers the picture is so dim it can barley be seen, and the colors are completly messed up.  I am able to exit X, but the colors and screen dimness stay untill i reboot the machine

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install the video card.
2.emerge nvidia-glx
3.change xorg.conf settings for nvidia drivers
4.startx



Expected Results:  
to work properly.  :)

Did read bug report and like to add a short notice:
Get a similar dim screen when I decide to not use nVidia drivers. In fault state I do switch in xorg.conf from driver nvidia to nv and let X not use nvidia.
I believe the screen settings are higher than the nv driver will accept.
Normaly I do use 1280*1024 in truecolour @ 85Hz. I believe that it will work in 60Hz, but did not test until now.

So Jeremi is it possible that your nvidia driver is not used when you see the failure?

These versions are gone. If you still have issue w/ up-to-date xorg-server and nvidia-drivers, file a new bug.
