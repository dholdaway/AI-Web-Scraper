Since the soon to be released version of enlightenment clearly aims to be more than just a window manager and more some kind of desktop environment, I think it would be fair and good, if it would get it's own category.

We already have {gnome,gnustep,kde,lxde,razorqt,rox}-* treated as "special", so I don't see why enlightenment shouldn't be on that list, espacially since I'm sure it's more widely used/accepted than LXDE or ROX and will surely gain more traction once it's final.

Reproducible: Always

for most packages, a new category is more detrimental than beneficial (like the terminals or media players).  the e_modules packages are the only ones i could see getting their own category, but it's not like we really gain anything from creating our own over x11-plugins.

i'm content to leave it be, especially considering changing categories isn't a trivial operation: it requires editing & revbumping a lot of packages as well as painful cvs operations and updating of profiles/updates/.
