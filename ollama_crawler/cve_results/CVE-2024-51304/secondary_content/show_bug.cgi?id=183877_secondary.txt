Description

"emerge openoffice" failed on ppc at package: dev-java/ibm-jdk-bin-1.5.0.5. Portage says "[it] has fetch restriction turned on..." and suggests a download page (the URL above) which doesn't work. the URL now requests a login/passord to get the download, at least from where I'm sitting. I need the 32 bit, non-Intel version, I suppose.

Portage says "If it doesn't work, file a bug" so here I am (my first bug!)

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
I emerged openoffice without having the dev-java/ibm-jdk-bin-1.5.06 package installed.

Expected Results:  
Emerge quit, telling me to download the distfiles and then to resume.

Given links that work?

The link works just fine. There is no way to legally install ibm-jdk-bin without registering on their site. If you can't download it after registering please reopen.
