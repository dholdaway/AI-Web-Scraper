 Inside Encore Wire Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
However, decreases in copper and other material prices could necessitate establishing an LCM reserve in future periods.



 Financial - Expense   Highlight
The acquisition of copper cathode by Copper ETFs may materially decrease or interrupt the availability of copper for immediate delivery in the United States, which could materially increase the Company’s cost of copper.

 Other - Other   Highlight
In addition to rising copper prices and potential supply shortages, we believe that ETFs and similar copper-backed derivative products could lead to increased price volatility for copper.

 Other - Other   Highlight
The Company decreased the reserve for credit losses in 2023 by $1.3 million, did not record a reserve for credit losses in 2022, and increased the reserve by $1.5 million in 2021.

 Other - Other   Highlight
