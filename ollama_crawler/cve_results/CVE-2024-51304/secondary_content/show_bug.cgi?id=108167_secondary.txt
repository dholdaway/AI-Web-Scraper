Description


runlevel0





          2005-10-05 04:04:21 UTC
        

Kword crashes just after startup or after closing the document menu.

This bug is not Gentoo specific, I opened it here in the KDE bugzilla, where you
can also find the solution:

http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=113887



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Kword
2. close the document selector or change focus to the main document window
3. crash




SOLUTION:

This crash is caused by stale ~/.ispell* or ~/.aspell* files from older
spellchecker installations. Removing them from the home directory will make
kword behave normally.
