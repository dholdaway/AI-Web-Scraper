It's possible to change portage in a way that will accept this kind of syntax?

emerge foo/bar[use1 -use2]

You can already "emerge foo/bar[use1,-use2]" and autounmask will kick in to apply any required changes, does that help?

Thanks, tried before but didn't know of the comma separator. As the comma separator is the same in the *DEPEND variables too, i'll close this.
