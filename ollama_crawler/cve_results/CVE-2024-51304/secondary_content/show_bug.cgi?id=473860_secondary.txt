Description

www-client/google-chrome-28.0.1500.45_p205727:stable has the ~ARCH KEYWORDS. This results in a "SLOT conflict" with beta SLOT (www-client/google-chrome-28.0.1500.45_beta205727:beta).

To prevent a slotted install and to push the current stable version to the users www-client/google-chrome-28.0.1500.45_p205727:stable KEYWORDS should be "-* amd64 x86".

Thanks!

Reproducible: Always

If you are asking to mark it stable, it will never go for it.

I'd suggest to put in your package.keywords one of these:

www-client/google-chrome:stable
www-client/google-chrome:beta

I guess, in this case, the slot are here to have order between the versions and not to install them at the same time ( I suggested it time ago )

There should not be a slot conflict here. You obviously can't have both slots installed at the same time, but portage should be able to switch between them somewhat gracefully.

If you provide the full portage error output, I'm happy to help get to the bottom of whatever error you are seeing.

I have migrated from www-client/chromium to www-client/google-chrome a few weeks ago (~arch). Chromium maintains arch keywording for stable slot, ~arch for beta slot and -arch for alpha slot. I assumed that the same keywording scheme was applicable to google-chrome and was not expecting a slot change. Therefore I assumed that the keywording wasn't correct when Portage wanted to move from beta slot to stable slot. You are completely correct when you say that Portage changes from beta to stable slot (somewhat) gracefully. If this is the desired behavior then I apologise for the noise.

Yeah, that's how it is supposed to work. We can't stabilize it because we can't mirror the deb files because of a licensing issue.

I recommend selecting a slot in your world file like this:

emerge --deselect www-client/google-chrome
emerge --noreplace www-client/google-chrome:beta

You can replace the ":beta" part with ":stable" or ":unstable" depending on which release series you want to follow.
