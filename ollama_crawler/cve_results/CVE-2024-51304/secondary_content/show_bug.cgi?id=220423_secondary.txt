Description

After upgrading libtool to version 2.2.4, apache2 can not start anymore. When downgrade back to version 1.5.26, it works as expected.

# /etc/init.d/apache2 start
 * Apache2 has detected a syntax error in your configuration files:
apache2: Syntax error on line 148 of /etc/apache2/httpd.conf: Syntax error on line 4 of /etc/apache2/modules.d/70_mod_php5.conf: Cannot load /usr/lib64/apache2/modules/libphp5.so into server: libltdl.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
 * ERROR: apache2 failed to start

The library /usr/lib64/libltdl.so.3 was replaced by /usr/lib64/libltdl.so.7 during the upgrade.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge =sys-devel/libtool-2.2.4
2. /etc/init.d/apache2 start

Actual Results:  
Apache server does not start complaining about missing library libltdl.so.3

Post install message to run revdep-rebuild missing, I'd say.

Strange, I was pretty sure that I ran revdep-rebuild after that upgrade, but obviously I forgot, because running revdep-rebuild solves the problem. Sorry for the noise.

Tomáši, carlo's comment means that the libtool ebuild doesn't ask users to run revde-rebuild. That's indeed an error, so this bug shouldn't be closed.

portage preserves ABI libs and displays appropriate notices ... no need for ebuilds to do it anymore
