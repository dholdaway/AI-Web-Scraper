When i start thunderbird i didn`t see the extra button provided by replytolist. I see only reply and reply all as usual, reply to list is missing.

Have i missed something? The homepage of the extension states the following
requirements:

1. A patched version of Thunderbird.
2. Either Mnenhy or Enigmail installed.
3. My extension.

The patch is included in the ebuild, the replytolist extension is pulled
in by the USE flag and enigmail is installed too. So i think i have met
all requirements!

I don't know which additional information i can provide, so if you need something feel free to ask.

By the way i have found another replytolist extension [1]. It works with an unpatched version of thunderbird. It is more or less a hack according to the author, and it changes the reply-to after the message window has opened, but it works for me. There are also other useful extensions for thunderbird there , unfortunately they are all discontinued including the replytolist extension. Allthough i think it is worth a look.
