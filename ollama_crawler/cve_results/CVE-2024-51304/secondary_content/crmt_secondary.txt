EXHIBIT 99.1America’s Car-Mart Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2024 Results
ROGERS, Ark., June  18, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- America’s Car-Mart, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRMT) (“we,” “Car-Mart” or the “Company”), today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended April 30, 2024. Fourth Quarter Key Highlights (FY’24 Q4 vs. FY’23 Q4, unless otherwise noted) Revenue was $364.7 million, down 5.8%Gross Margin improved to 35.5%, up 200 bpsTotal collections increased 5.0% to $187.2 millionFavorable adjustment to allowance for credit loss to 25.32%, down from 25.74%Net charge-offs as a % of average finance receivables were 7.3% vs. 6.3%Interest expense increase of $4.9 million or 38.2%Diluted earnings per share $0.06 vs. $0.32 Full Year Key Highlights (FY’24 vs. FY’23, unless otherwise noted) Revenue was $1.4 billion, down 0.5%Gross Margin increased to 34.7%, up 120 bpsTotal collections increased 9.2% to $688.9 millionSG&A per average account was down 2.5%Interest expense increase of $27.0 million or 70.6%Loss per share $4.92 vs. $3.11 diluted earnings per shareSignificant progress on strategic initiatives – implementation of Loan Origination System (LOS), initiation of Cox partnership, deployment of acquisition strategy President and CEO Commentary, Doug Campbell “Our sales results improved sequentially but fell short of our internal expectations for the quarter. I am encouraged by our disciplined management on several fronts, including SG&A, total cash collected from customers, improved down payments, and stronger gross margins -- all of which were improved over the prior year quarter. The LOS and its improved underwriting capability continues to deliver superior results when compared to our legacy system and aided in a reduction in our provision for credit loss. We are also thrilled about our most recent acquisition and welcome our new associates from Texas Auto Center to the Car-Mart family. This transaction closed June 3, 2024, and is the largest acquisition to date for our company. Despite these positives, the persistent inflationary environment driven by macro trends disproportionately impacted our customer base. In the upcoming year we are confident in our multi-pronged approach to lower overall vehicle costs and improve affordability for our consumers.” Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2024 Key Operating Metrics  Dollars in thousands, except per share data. Dollar and percentage changes may not recalculate due to rounding. Charts may not be to scale.   Note: Discussions in each section provide information for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, unless otherwise noted. Fourth Quarter Business Review  TOTAL REVENUE – A 5.8% drop in revenue was primarily driven by the decrease in retail units sold. A portion of the decline in revenue was offset by an increased average retail sales price and increased interest income. SALES – Sales for the quarter were 15,251 units vs. 17,655 units, down 13.6%. It is important to note that we saw a rebound in volumes as the third quarter was down 19.6% in unit volumes sold. We continue to iterate on our new origination platform and our marketing plan to efficiently produce volumes at an appropriate risk. GROSS PROFIT – Gross profit margin as a percentage of sales was 35.5%, or $7,132 per unit, compared to 33.5% or $6,354 per unit. This 12.2% increase resulted from continued execution on pricing discipline, improvements in the vehicle repair expenses, and optimization of transportation costs. NET CHARGE-OFFS – Net charge-offs as a percentage of average finance receivables were 7.3% compared to 6.3%. As a reference, the quarterly performance of net charge-offs for the five-year period preceding the pandemic period ranged from 5.9% - 8.7%, signaling a return to more normal pre-pandemic levels. On a relative basis, we experienced continued increases in both the frequency and severity of losses, with the frequency increase accounting for approximately 58% of the increase. ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES – The allowance for credit loss as a percentage of finance receivables, net of deferred revenue and pending accident protection plan claims, decreased from 25.74% at January 31, 2024, to 25.32% at April 30, 2024, providing a 42 bps benefit to the provision for credit losses. The adjustment was primarily driven by the improved experience of contracts underwritten in our new system. As of April 30, 2024, approximately 20% of the portfolio balance originated from our new LOS system. Delinquencies (accounts over 30 days past due) improved by 50 bps to 3.1% of finance receivables as of April 30, 2024, and sequentially by 20 bps from 3.3% of finance receivables as of January 31, 2024. UNDERWRITING – Average down payments improved to 6.5%, 40 bps over the prior year fourth quarter and 140 bps sequentially. The average originating term for the quarter was 44.0 months, up from the prior year’s 43.5 months and the third quarter’s 43.3 months. The average retail sales price increased by $1,123 or 6.2%, with a 0.5 month increase in the term. Stronger deal structures improved projected cash-on-cash returns to 69.5% for the first full quarter of LOS originations. SG&A EXPENSE – SG&A expense was $44.5 million compared to $45.8 million. Continued focus on SG&A and actions taken during the third quarter assisted in bringing SG&A per average account down 4.0%, despite the impact of $1.3 million in stock compensation. These efforts resulted in the lowest percentage change in annual SG&A in over five years at just a 1.5% increase. LEVERAGE & LIQUIDITY – Debt to finance receivable and debt, net of cash to finance receivables (non-GAAP)1 were 52.6% and 46.0%, compared to 46.5% and 41.5%, respectively, at the end of the prior year’s fourth quarter (sequentially 51.8% and 45.2%, respectively). During the fiscal year, we grew finance receivables by $62.0 million, decreased inventory by $1.8 million, and purchased investment and fixed assets of $11.0 million with a $89.4 million increase in debt, net of cash. Available borrowings under our revolving credit facility were $73.4 million. ACQUISTIONS & DISPOSITIONS – Subsequent to the fiscal year end the Company announced and closed on the acquisition of Texas Auto Center (TAC), operating two dealerships in Austin and San Marcos, Texas. TAC is a nearly 30-year-old company owned by Bob and Erika Blankenship. This acquisition is expected to deliver exceptional outcomes for customers, associates, and shareholders. TAC’s high-performance culture, customer focus, and values align with Car-Mart. The structure will be consistent with prior transactions whereby the Company will not acquire credit risk, and the sellers may receive a performance-based earn-out in the future. We also have several stores which we are performance managing by restricting capital. We expect that restricting investments to these underperforming locations will rebalance our portfolio, allowing us to prioritize higher-return locations and redeploy cash more effectively. As mentioned before, we will be more agile in deploying strategies that provide the best return for our shareholders. Three dealerships were closed during the fiscal year. 1 Calculation of this non-GAAP financial measure and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included in the tables accompanying this release ANNUAL CASH-ON-CASH RETURNS – Cash-on-Cash (CoC) returns continue to be very favorable. During the quarter, the frequency of loss on loans originated in fiscal years 2021 through 2023 were higher than prior projections; however, they represent a smaller balance of our portfolio. In contrast, the originations generated during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 had a combination of improved cash down and expected lower loss rates from LOS originations, which drove a 160 bps improvement in the expected CoC returns for loans originated in the fiscal year 2024.

This includes down-payments, principal and interest collected (including special and seasonal payments) and the fair market value of repossessed vehicles, if applicable. “Cash out” includes purchase price paid by the Company to acquire the vehicle (including reconditioning and transportation costs), and all other post-sale expenses as well as expenses related to our ancillary products. The calculation assumes estimates on expected credit losses net of fair market value of repossessed vehicles and the related timing of such losses as well as post sales repair expenses and special payments. The Company evaluates and updates expected credit losses quarterly. The credit quality of each pool is monitored and compared to prior and initial forecasts and is reflected in our on-going internal cash-on-cash projections.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  This press release contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). We present total debt, net of total cash, to finance receivables, a non-GAAP measure, as a supplemental measure of our performance. We believe total debt, net of total cash, to finance receivables is a useful measure to monitor leverage and evaluate balance sheet risk. This measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported GAAP results because it may include or exclude certain items as compared to similar GAAP-based measures, and such measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. We strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements included in publicly filed reports in their entirety and not rely solely on any one, single financial measure or communication. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, for non-GAAP financial measures are presented in the tables of this release.

The amount of deferred revenue related to ancillary products for a customer account that is charged off has historically been recognized as sales revenue at the time of charge-off because the earnings stream for the deferred revenue is completed at the time of charge-off. It was determined that this amount should more appropriately be recorded as a reduction to customer accounts receivable at the time of charge-off, thus reducing the amounts historically reported in sales revenue, net charge-offs, the provision for credit losses and the allowance for credit losses. As a result, certain amounts for sales revenue, provision for credit losses, charge-offs, net of collateral recovered, and the allowance for credit losses have been revised from the amounts previously reported to correct these errors. The impact of these adjustments resulted in a cumulative decrease in the allowance for credit losses of $9.4 million as of April 30, 2022. Management has evaluated the materiality of these corrections to its prior period financial statements from a quantitative and qualitative perspective and has concluded that this change was not material to any prior annual or interim period.  (2)Some items in the prior year financial statements were reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
