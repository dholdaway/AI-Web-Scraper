When we provide our expectation for adjusted EPS and free cash flow on a forward-looking basis, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures (expected diluted EPS from continuing operations and expected cash flow from operations) is not available without unreasonable effort due to the unavailability of items for exclusion from the GAAP measure (such as unusual gains and losses, the ultimate outcome of pending litigation, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the impact and timing of potential acquisitions and divestitures and other structural changes). We are unable to address the probable significance of this information, the variability of which may have a significant impact on future GAAP results. See “Use and Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for information regarding non-GAAP financial measures.1 2020 - 2025 sales growth and segment margin expansion have been adjusted for certain completed and planned announced divestitures.The following information was filed by Raytheon Technologies Corp (RTX) on Tuesday, January 23, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.

 Inside Raytheon Technologies Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
If the completed distributions of Carrier or Otis, in each case, or certain internal business separation transactions, were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment, the Company could be subject to significant liabilities, and there could be material adverse impacts on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity in future reporting periods.



 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Increasing material, component, and labor prices could subject us to losses in our fixed price contracts in the event of cost overruns.

 Other - Other   Highlight
These impacts could be material to the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Potential changes to these assumptions and actual incurred costs could significantly affect the estimates inherent in our financial statements and could have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations for the periods in which they are recognized.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
The Company continuously monitors and evaluates relevant events and circumstances that could unfavorably impact our significant assumptions used in testing goodwill, including changes to U.S. treasury rates and equity risk premiums, tax rates, recent market valuations from transactions by comparable companies, volatility in the Company’s market capitalization, and general industry, market, and macro-economic conditions.
