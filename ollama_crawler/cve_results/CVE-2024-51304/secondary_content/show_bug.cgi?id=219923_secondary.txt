As of today Amarok 1.4.8 stopped working (i.e. started freezing) for me all of the sudden. Even after I emerge --sync'ed and updated kdelibs to 3.5.9-r3 and re-emerged amarok. I even checked revdep-rebuild and no luck.

Steps of reproduction:
* start amarok (or amarokapp)

Reproducable:
* so far always since it started happening

What happens:
* the amarok window displays
* the playlist loads (while the context list stays blank)
* the cursor stays in "thinking"/clock mode and the Amarok window is completely unresponsive and stays like

Console output of 'amarokapp':
kdecore (KAction): WARNING: KAction::insertKAccel( kaccel = 0xac9a00 ): KAccel object already contains an action name "play_pause"
QLayout "unnamed" added to QVBox "unnamed", which already has a layout
kdecore (KAction): WARNING: KAction::insertKAccel( kaccel = 0xac9a00 ): KAccel object already contains an action name "play_pause"
QLayout: Adding KToolBar/mainToolBar (child of QVBox/unnamed) to layout for PlaylistWindow/PlaylistWindow

kdecore (KAction): WARNING: KActionCollection::KActionCollection( QObject *parent, const char *name, KInstance *instance )

Re-emerging media-libs/xine-lib fixed it. Which is very odd, since I didn't update anything in between the time it last worked and the time it broke. Anyway, works now.

Sorry for the bug :/

Aaaand it happened again. Out of the blue.

What happened since my last report:
* I played the music
* stopped it (had lunch)
* pressed "play" again
* Amarok froze

I tried to replicate it by killing Amarok and starting it again and the same happens as in my initial report.

Reopening the bug.

Now the reproducing is not constant anymore. I'll report when I find a logic by which the bug reoccurs. Since I posted the bug it's been about 8 times reproducable on start, 2 times while resuming play and 2 times not reproduced.

Ehm, just to add inputs, does it happen always starting the same song/format
of songs? Or with songs that have special/local characters in filename or ID3
tags?

No, nothing special. I have some tracks with special chars, but those aren't even in the playlist when it's triggered. It did happen always with mp3, but I'm sure that's not the cause, since it the very same track works normally at one time and at those "odd times" it freezes.

I still haven't found any logic -- so far Amarok plays along just fine with the very same playlist that broke it the last time. Odd.

Are you using PulseAudio output by chance?

No, I don't have it even emerged. I'm using the Xine engine.

Also it's been a while since the freeze happened to me the last time.

Reassigning amarok bugs to Ben as I won't be around for a while (leaving soon for the hospital -- either they hospitalise me or I get to convalescence). Ben feel free to update metadata if you wish, Amarok better have a new maintainer for the future.

Resolving for now. If the issue reappears, feel free to reopen.
