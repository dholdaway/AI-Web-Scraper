Issue: app-shells/nushell-0.64.0 fails to compile (lto).
Discovered on: amd64 (internal ref: lto_tinderbox)

NOTE:
This machine uses lto with CFLAGS=-flto -Werror=odr -Werror=lto-type-mismatch -Werror=strict-aliasing

Created attachment 788498 [details]
build.log.xz

build log and emerge --info (compressed because it exceeds attachment limit, use 'xzless' to read it)

As far as I can tell this is totally unrelated to LTO. Also, it compiles fine right now.

For unknown reasons, at that time I was asked to block bug 618550 for each issue from lto_tinderbox. The same applies to all bugs that block bug 618550 that looks to be unrelated to lto

I think this was fixed by us adding filter-lto to cargo.eclass.

Okay so apparently this is actually about bug 893658 which isn't really an LTO bug.

It's just that when you have LTO, rustc doesn't know how to read gcc bytecode (and apparently it works fine with clang? maybe?) so it just cannot find code, period.
