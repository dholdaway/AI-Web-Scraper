/etc/limits says this at the top:

# /etc/limits contains user resource limits.
# See limits(5).

man 5 limits returns no manual entries, and the ebuild doesn't have a doc flag.

no real information here like `emerge info` ... my guess is you have USE=pam

shadow-4.0.14-r1 provides limits(5) when USE=-pam as pam-login should be providing it ...

but since newer versions of shadow have integrated pam-login back in, this isnt an issue anymore
