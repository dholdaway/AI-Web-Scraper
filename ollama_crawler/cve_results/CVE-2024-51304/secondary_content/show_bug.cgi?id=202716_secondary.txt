Description

Please clarify the portage descriptions of openafs vs openafs-kernel.
openafs-kernel seems clear that it is a kernel MODULE.. which is fine. But what is openafs user space? a kernel patch that will be compiled into the kernel?

Thanks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.emerge -s openafs
Actual Results:  
# emerge -s openafs
*  net-fs/openafs
      Description:   The OpenAFS distributed file system

*  net-fs/openafs-kernel
      Description:   The OpenAFS distributed file system kernel module



Expected Results:  
# emerge -s openafs
*  net-fs/openafs
      Description:   The OpenAFS distributed file system

*  net-fs/openafs-kernel
      Description:   The OpenAFS distributed file system kernel module

The description of the former could be improved by adding some clue that here the userland utils/daemon are meant.

Actually, my view on this was that:
  net-fs/openafs-kernel includes only the kernel module (which you found clear enough)

  net-fs/openafs is the ebuild you need to emerge, which includes everything,
    also the kernel module, through a dependency.  

Much like sys-cluster/drbd depends on sys-cluster/drbd-kernel, or sys-cluster/gnbd depends on sys-cluster/gnbd-kernel.  

Changing the description seems to me like suggesting to the user that they need to emerge both packages in order to get a working system.  

But this is of course heavily debatable :)

No feedback for some time, closing.
