 Inside Godaddy Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates, which could have a material impact on the amount of DTAs we ultimately realize.



 Other - Other   Highlight
Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our business, operating results or financial condition.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, which, in turn, could change our results from those reported.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
These increases were partially offset by a decrease in cost of revenue related to our hosting business, which is consistent with the decline in revenue for this business due to end of life migrations away from certain products, the divestiture of certain hosting assets during 2023 and lower demand amid the uncertain macroeconomic environment.
