package sys-libs/timezone-data-2006a NOT merged


If i move these files to another directory, i get more files blocking this package. I have to remove the hole zoneinfo directory and /usr/bin/tzselect, /usr/sbin/zic and /usr/sbin/zdump to get the package emerged.

OS: Gentoo Linux hardened
Kernel: 2.6.14-hardened-r5

If i can add something more or it is nothing for a bugreport please notice me. I am no professional bug report writer.

Sorry, that cannot be fixed, it replaces the files installed by previous glibc version... emerge timezone-data w/ FEATURES="-collision-protect".

Well, that workaround (FEATURES="-collision-protect")
should be clearly advised by the timezone-data ebuild.

The way it currently is just breaks upgrades without
letting the user know what to do.

Uh, this bug is completely irrelevant now and has been for quite some time (noone will hit this on a fresh system, only a problem if you have glibc-2.3 installed, which is EOL-ed).

May I remind you that hardened still uses glibc-2.3? :)
