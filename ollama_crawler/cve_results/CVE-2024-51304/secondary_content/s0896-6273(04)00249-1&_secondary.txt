This relatively simple locomotor behavior is generated by the rhythmic activity of motor neurons under the control of spinal neural networks known as central pattern generators (CPGs) that comprise multiple interneuron cell types. Little, however, is known about the identity and contribution of defined interneuronal populations to mammalian locomotor behaviors. We show a discrete subset of commissural spinal interneurons, whose fate is controlled by the activity of the homeobox gene Dbx1, has a critical role in controlling the left-right alternation of motor neurons innervating hindlimb muscles. Dbx1 mutant mice lacking these ventral interneurons exhibit an increased incidence of cobursting between left and right flexor/extensor motor neurons during drug-induced locomotion. Together, these findings identify Dbx1-dependent interneurons as key components of the spinal locomotor circuits that control stepping movements in mammals.cell.comShow moreShow lessSave Cite Cited by 523 Related articles All 12 versions  PrivacyTermsHelpAbout ScholarSearch help
