# grep -i paste $(qlist dev-python/dulwich)

Show the output of:
grep -r "Paste>=1.3" /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages

That has been running for several last hours and nothing so far.

What are you looking for? Im guessing you are searching for some dependency definitions, but in that case you are missing any other syntax for depending on paste. Dont you wanna rather some `find -name $something -exec grep` thing?

some observations:

1) I wonder whether this isn't a distutils problems instead of dulwich' one
2) assume-digest suggests you have lots of local messing around going on
3) I don't have paste installed on my system, yet dulwich installed fine

ad 2) that's just added some echo $something somewhere when i was investigating something.

does distutils contain some kind of plugin facility?

Show the output of:
$ python2.7 -c 'import sys; print(sys.path)'
$ find $(python2.7 -c 'import sys; print("\n".join(x for x in sys.path if x))') -iname "*dulwich*"

Turns out the issue disappeared after
emerge paste
finishing emerge -uaNDv world
emerge -c
revdep-rebuild
emerge -C paste

now, emerge dulwich or zope-interface doesnt manifest the issue.

version:
zope-interface  (~)3.8.0[1] progress
dulwich 0.7.1 official tree
setuptools (~)0.6.24[1] progress
