I tried to upgrade mysql from 4.0.24 to 4.1.14. Followed the instruction, everything went smoothly until run revdep-rebuild. It gave me 

emerge --oneshot --nodeps  =dev-php/mod_php-4.4.0-r3 =dev-php/php-4.4.0-r1 =net-dialup/freeradius-1.0.5 =net-libs/libwww-5.4.0-r3
..........
Calculating dependencies \
emerge: there are no ebuilds to satisfy "=net-dialup/freeradius-1.0.5".

Result is not OK, you have following choices:
- if emerge failed during build, fix the problems and re-run revdep-rebuild
    or
- use -X or --package-names as first argument (try to rebuild package, not exact
  ebuild - ignores SLOT!)
    or
- set ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~<your platform>" and/or /etc/portage/package.unmask
  (and remove /root/.revdep-rebuild.5_order to be evaluated again)
    or
- modify the above emerge command and run it manually
    or
- compile or unmerge unsatisfied packages manually, remove temporary files and
  try again (you can edit package/ebuild list first)

Does anybody know how to solve it?

Thanks in advance!

You also don't want mod_php really, it's completely unmaintained and unsupported. Switch to dev-lang/php.
