This file does not appear on any mirror I try. Did someone forget to upload it?

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge sync
2. emerge world -u
3. brake on binutils-2.15.92.0.2-r7 because I can't download the file

no it's been uploaded, I guess the mirrors just haven't caught up.  Can you try fetching from gentoo.osuosl.org?

Sorry. I didn't realize that it was a fresh addition to portage. I must have synced right on your heels.
