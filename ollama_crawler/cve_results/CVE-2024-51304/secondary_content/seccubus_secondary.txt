Seccubus automates regular vulnerability scans with various tools and aids
security people in the fast analysis of its output, both on the first scan and
on repeated scans.
On repeated scan delta reporting ensures that findings only need to be judged
when they first appear in the scan results or when their output changes.
Seccubus 2.x is the only actively developed and maintained branch and all support
for Seccubus V1 has officially been dropped.
Seccubus V2 works with the following scanners:

Nessus
OpenVAS
Skipfish
Medusa (local and remote)
Nikto (local and remote)
NMap (local and remote)
OWASP-ZAP (local and remote)
SSLyze
Medusa
Qualys SSL labs
testssl.sh (local and remote)
