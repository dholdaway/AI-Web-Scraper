https://devmanual.gentoo.org/general-concepts/tree/index.html#what-belongs-in-the-tree%3F says: 

   Things that do not belong in the tree:
   * Files whose name starts with a dot

Should we account for legitimate exceptions like metadata/.cvsignore and .gitignore, or is common sense enough here?

I guess this isn't really an issue. Closing.
