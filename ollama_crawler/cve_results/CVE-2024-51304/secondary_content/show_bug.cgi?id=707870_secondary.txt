You have two packages that explicitly depend on x11-base/xorg-proto[0] which fail to find the headers that package installs.

Please fix your local problem and try again.



[0] In the case of libvdpau you had USE=dri which should have pulled in the headers package as well.

Seems to be related to GCC upgrade.
Resolved after doing:
# emerge --ask --emptytree --usepkg=n @system
