--newuse option were added to stage4 to fix bug 234239.
I suggest to use it everywere to get the script a little cleaner removing set_eopts_on_pkg_status function.
Next attached my proposed patch.

Created attachment 174670 [details, diff]
crossdev-0.9.19.patch

Tested running 'crossdev i686-mingw32'.
I have tried to stop it after emerging cross-gcc-stage1 and to run it again: stages up to cross-gcc-stage1 were not rebuilt.

crossdev uses -u, so the initial stages don't get re-emerged
