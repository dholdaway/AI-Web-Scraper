From Debian Security Advisory DSA 836-1
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-2960

Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña discovered insecure temporary file use
in cfengine2, a tool for configuring and maintaining networked
machines, that can be exploited by a symlink attack to overwrite
arbitrary files owned by the user executing cfengine, which is
probably root.

Hrm.. I looked into it and couldn't find much information about it and the fix.
I just emailed the cfengine list to get some more feedback on the issue. In the
meantime, I did notice they had a newer version of cfengine out that I hadn't
bumped yet. I'll see about bumping that (even though there is no mention about a
security fix in the changelog).

I started the thread [1] on the cfengine mailing list and I got two reponses
back. The first [2] one went into detail about the actual vuln being a
third-party script thats called vicf. Some of the older ebuilds used to include
this because it was in the contrib folder. The latest ebuilds I have in portage
right now shouldn't include that script. The second [3] reply was from the
actual author of cfengine basically saying the same thing.

My call is that this shouldn't be a problem since I don't include those scripts
anymore. I just double checked and I just removed the ebuilds that used to have
that file included a few days ago. If anyone hadn't updated cfengine in the last
say.. 2-3 months, they may be vuln to this exploit. But this exploit is only if
they use the third party scripts.

Let me know if you need more information.

OK, we'll consider this one fixed in recent versions, and not worth a GLSA
(obscure contrib script). Thanks for investigating this.

Security: feel free to reopen if you disagree.
