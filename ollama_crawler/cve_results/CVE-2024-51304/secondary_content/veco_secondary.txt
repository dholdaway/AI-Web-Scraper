 Inside Veeco Instruments Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actuals results.



 Financial - Expense   Highlight
However, expenses as a percentage of revenue have remained flat when compared to the prior period.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Any material changes in the identification of performance obligations, determination and allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations, and determination of when transfer of control occurs to the customer, could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
While these new regulations have not had a material impact to our business, the export regulation landscape is fluid and evolving, and it is possible that the issuance of additional export controls could further restrict our ability to sell to customers in China and lead to future revenue loss.

 Other - Other   Highlight
At each reporting date, we consider new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect our view of the future realization of our deferred tax assets.
