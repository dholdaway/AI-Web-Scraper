Hi! I noticed recently that you guys added an ebuild for the X.Org input driver for libinput. However, it looks like you guys haven't added an appropriate use flag to the xorg-drivers package yet.

That INPUT_DEVICES=libinput was already added to xorg-drivers on Wed Feb 4 17:44:36 2015 UTC. Please sync your tree.
