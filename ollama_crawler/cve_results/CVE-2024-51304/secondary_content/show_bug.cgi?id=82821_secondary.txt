Description

I am trying an ~amd64-stage-1 installation. The base system is already installed. Now I want a KDE. Here is a problem.

/usr/X11R6 was a symlink on:
/usr/X11R6 -> ../usr

But qt gives configure errors because it cannot find libraries which are in
/usr/lib64
I could compile qt though by doing this:
rm /usr/X11R6
mkdir /usr/X11R6
ln -s /usr/lib64 /usr/X11R6/lib

But now other application (like xfontserver) can't find their libraries.

I assume that another problem has ado with it, too.

gtk+ can't find pango (configure error) although I have installed it.

So what should I do now?

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
emerge qt
or:
emerge gtk+


Actual Results:  
configure errors 

Expected Results:  
compile and work...
