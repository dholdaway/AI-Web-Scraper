Description

Grub2 has been masked a while ago, due to the lack of docummentation. However, during first install it is installing and configuring it nearly automatically. There is even no need to edit /boot/grub2/grub.cfg as created by system configuration file works properly. Also, the ebuild informs users about web page, where they can find additional information. To be honest, the only thing i needed to do was to write "grub2-install --no-floppy /dev/sda".

Due to that, in my opinion, the installation & configuration of grub2 is even faster and easier than grub 0.9x (legacy) and i think, it can be unmasked.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. echo "sys-boot/grub" >> /etc/portage/package.unmask
2. emerge grub
3. grub2-install --no-floppy /dev/sda
Actual Results:  
Everything working correctly, w/o any needs to do anything else.

Expected Results:  
As actual result, so in my opinion you can unmask it.

The maintainers will unmask the package when they deem it ready.
