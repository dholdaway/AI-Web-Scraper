I installed xlock with pam support, when entering password to unlock, messages say:
May 15 20:59:16 mercure xlock: PAM unable to dlopen(/lib/security/pam_pwdb.so)
May 15 20:59:16 mercure xlock: PAM [dlerror: /lib/security/pam_pwdb.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory]
May 15 20:59:16 mercure xlock: PAM adding faulty module: /lib/security/pam_pwdb.so

after installing pam_pwdfile it works fine.

Hmm works fine here, also the only pamd file which ships with xlock uses pam_stack to use the system-auth procedure, which, by default, doesn't use pam_pwdb.

grep pam_pwdb /etc/pam.d/* what outputs?
