Fixed-width fonts for fast reading on the Linux console

This package installs in /usr/share/consolefonts several console variants of the Terminus font. If you have to work for extended time in front of monitor (i.e. over eight hours), you may find that using of these fonts reduces your eyes-fatigue.


hey guys, today i talked @ #gentoo irc and made the suggestion of using Uni3-Terminus16 as consolefont (beandog liked it)

http://www.grml.org/screenshots/booting.png
Uni3-Terminus16 is used in the grml (livecd) boot process and tty-s to spice things up :) 


I couldn't find it nowhere included in media-fonts/*, so i had to download console-terminus_4.26-1_all.deb, extract Uni3-Terminus16.psf.gz and move it to /usr/share/consolefonts myself to use it as consolefont.

Is there a way Uni3-Terminus16 gets included in other packages, like media-fonts/terminus-fonts, which install consolefonts to /usr/share/consolefonts, or add console-terminus as a whole to the portage tree?

Hopefully, i didn't overlook something.

Reproducible: Always

media-fonts/terminus-font perhaps? Adding beandog to sort things out.

The URL you added points to the exact same Debian package that is represented as media-fonts/terminus-font in Gentoo:
HOMEPAGE="http://www.is-vn.bg/hamster/jimmy-en.html"

I just committed 4.26 to the tree, yet I wonder if the exact file you would like to use is in there. The names seem to be different.

thx, for the bump, jer!

I was confused with the *.deb packages and the different names for the fonts.

It turns out you were absolutely right and media-fonts/terminus-font includes the font i wanna use but with a different name! Instead of 'Uni3-Terminus16' it is 'ter-116n'; so far it seems both are quite the same \o/

/usr/share/consolefonts/README.terminus has a listing with codepages/mappings/styles etc.. to use with terminus font as consolefont.

A chance 'ter-116n' or suitable font can be the default for the 2008.0 medium ;-)

As far as I can tell, there is no problem here anymore.  If you want to propose that the default console font be changed, please open a new bug for that issue.
