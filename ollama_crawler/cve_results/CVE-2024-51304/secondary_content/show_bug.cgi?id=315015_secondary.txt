If you visit g.o/doc/en/ you see a nice index page that has a number of links to the translated docs.

If you visit, for example, g.o/doc/nl/ you will see that there are more translations listed there than on the default index page.

A user pointed this out, saying that a search revealed the Dutch docs, as our page did not display a link.

Further it appears that there are more translations listed on the NL index than on /fi/, /fr/, /it/, /jp/ index pages and perhaps others.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/index.xml
2. View http://www.gentoo.org/doc/nl/
3. Compare available translations by inspecting linked "Available Languages"
4. Note that there are missing languages on the EN versus the NL.

We do that for translations that aren't official anymore because they aren't maintained. Our policy is that a translation has to be current and maintained for it to be listed. We don't think we're doing our users any good by listing all translations if they're three or six years old. Too much has changed in our docs!

Search around sources.gentoo.org/gentoo/xml/doc to see the other translations we've had to unlink. If we can find willing translators to bring at least the handbooks up-to-date, then we can relist them in the index.
