 Loading












Fixes #51836.
Motivation / Background
This Pull Request has been created because configuring a Docker persistent storage volume in Kamal seems to be only needed for sqlite or Active Storage. If using a different database and the --skip-active-storage option, configuration can be skipped.
Detail
This Pull Request changes the config/deploy.yml.tt template to skip persistent storage volume configuration if skipping Active Storage and using a database that is different from sqlite.
Additional information
The condition I implemented is the same as the one used here in the rails app generator.
Checklist
Before submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:

 This Pull Request is related to one change. Unrelated changes should be opened in separate PRs.
 Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: [Fix #issue-number]
 Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.
 CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.

Would you add a test to make sure this option works as expected? I think some tests at https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/railties/test/generators/app_generator_test.rb are helpful as a reference.

Don’t configure Kamal storage volume if not needed


    …

Configuring a persistent storage volume in Kamal
is needed only for sqlite or Active Storage. If
using a different database or the
--skip-active-storage option, this configuration
can be skipped.

It seems like the buildkite failed docs-preview job is unrelated.
