Description


Peter Kerwien





          2006-01-02 02:15:15 UTC
        

In the GCC upgrade guide (http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gcc-upgrading.xml) I receive an error if I follow the step:

> revdep-rebuild --library libstdc++.so.5 -- -p -v
> revdep-rebuild --library libstdc++.so.5

emerge complaints that the option --library is not known.

Should this step instead be?

> revdep-rebuild --soname libstdc++.so.5 -- -p -v
> revdep-rebuild --soname libstdc++.so.5

http://packages.gentoo.org/ebuilds/?gentoolkit-0.2.0-r3
The --soname parameter has been renamed to --library
Please upgrade gentoolkit

Sorry that I missed that. When I read the short usage info for revdep-rebuild it didn't mention that --library is the same(?) thing as --soname-regexp.
