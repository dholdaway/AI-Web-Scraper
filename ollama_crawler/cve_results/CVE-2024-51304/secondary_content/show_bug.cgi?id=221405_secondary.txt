Description


Diego Elio Pettenò (RETIRED)

The configure of your package checks for flex, even though your package might not contain .l files that flex uses to generate parsers. Your ebuild does not list a dependency on flex as per http://tinderbox.dev.gentoo.org/misc/dindex/sys-devel/flex .

Either disable the flex test during configure to avoid false positive, or add the dependency upon flex if it's needed by your package.

Thanks in advance,
Diego
