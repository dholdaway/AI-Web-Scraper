Hi,

You closed bug #148743, but sorry, same error.
You said :

>
> You didn't follow the instructions when upgrading net-libs/gnutls:
>
> revdep-rebuild --library libgnutls.so.12

Yes, exactly, see attached file.
Thanks.

ok.

 # emerge -1 cups && revdep-rebuild --library libgnutls.so.12

fix it.

So, revdep-rebuild should rebuild cups before ghostscript-esp.
Sorry for disturbing.
