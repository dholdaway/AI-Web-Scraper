Description

The herds have been deprecated by the Council and are being replaced
by projects. For this reason, please decide on the fate of the herd
stated in the summary and update [1] or state the request here.

The common choices are:

1. Map the herd to an existing project (in this case all packages
in the herd will be maintained by the project) -- let us know which
project to use.

2. Create a new project for the herd -- create the wiki page, let us
know the new mail alias name to be created, create the wiki page
and let us know about it.

3. Decide to disband the herd -- just let us know (but keep it for now
in herds.xml!), we'll replace it with individual maintainers when herds
are removed.

This herd does not contain any packages, so we need not to worry about it.
