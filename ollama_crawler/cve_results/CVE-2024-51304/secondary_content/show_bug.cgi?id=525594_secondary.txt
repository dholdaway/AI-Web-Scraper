Hello,

bedup need use dev-lang/python sqlite
Else you have:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python3.3/site-packages/sqlalchemy/dialects/sqlite/pysqlite.py", line 295, in dbapi
    from sqlite3 import dbapi2 as sqlite  # try 2.5+ stdlib name.
ImportError: No module named 'sqlite3'

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python-exec/python3.3/bedup", line 9, in <module>
    load_entry_point('bedup==0.9.0', 'console_scripts', 'bedup')()
  File "/usr/lib/python3.3/site-packages/bedup/__main__.py", line 487, in script_main
    sys.exit(main(sys.argv))
  File "/usr/lib/python3.3/site-packages/bedup/__main__.py", line 476, in main
    return args.action(args)
  File "/usr/lib/python3.3/site-packages/bedup/__main__.py", line 121, in vol_cmd
    sess = get_session(args)
  File "/usr/lib/python3.3/site-packages/bedup/__main__.py", line 100, in get_session
    url, echo=args.verbose_sql, poolclass=SingletonThreadPool)
  File "/usr/lib/python3.3/site-packages/sqlalchemy/engine/__init__.py", line 344, in create_engine
    return strategy.create(*args, **kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/python3.3/site-packages/sqlalchemy/engine/strategies.py", line 73, in create
    dbapi = dialect_cls.dbapi(**dbapi_args)
  File "/usr/lib/python3.3/site-packages/sqlalchemy/dialects/sqlite/pysqlite.py", line 297, in dbapi
    raise e
  File "/usr/lib/python3.3/site-packages/sqlalchemy/dialects/sqlite/pysqlite.py", line 292, in dbapi
    from pysqlite2 import dbapi2 as sqlite
When I add it, it work.

Cheers,

Reproducible: Always

It already depends on dev-python/sqlalchemy[sqlite] which should pull in python with sqlite. Please paste the output of 'emerge -pv dev-python/sqlalchemy'.

[ebuild   R    ] dev-python/sqlalchemy-0.9.2  USE="sqlite -doc -examples {-test}" PYTHON_TARGETS="python3_3 (-pypy) -python2_7 (-python3_2)" 0 kB
But pyhton was without sqlite...

I'm sorry but I have no clue what's happening here for you. If it happens anytime in the future, please feel free to reopen.
