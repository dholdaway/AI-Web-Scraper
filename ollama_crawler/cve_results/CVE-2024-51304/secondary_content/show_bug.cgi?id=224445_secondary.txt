Description

some aplications configs (like filzilla 3.0.10) look for wxrc and not for wxrc-2.6 , wxrc-2.8 etc.
if i make a symlink for wxrc ( --> wxrc-2.8 ) compilation is succesfull

"eselect wxwidgets set" should create the apropriate symlink     

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. copy /usr/portage/net-ftp/filezilla/filezilla-3.0.4.ebuild to your overlay dir
2. rename the copy to filezilla-3.0.10.ebuild
3. unmask and emerge

Actual Results:  
checking for wxrc... no
configure: error:
    wxrc could not be found. This program gets build together with wxWidgets.
    Please make sure wxrc is within your path.


!!! Please attach the following file when seeking support:
!!! /var/tmp/portage/net-ftp/filezilla-3.0.10/work/filezilla-3.0.10/config.log
 *
 * ERROR: net-ftp/filezilla-3.0.10 failed.
 * Call stack:
 *               ebuild.sh, line   49:  Called src_compile
 *             environment, line 2611:  Called econf
 *               ebuild.sh, line  513:  Called die
 * The specific snippet of code:
 *                      die "econf failed"
 *  The die message:
 *   econf failed
 *
 * If you need support, post the topmost build error, and the call stack if relevant.
 * A complete build log is located at '/var/tmp/portage/net-ftp/filezilla-3.0.10/temp/build.log'.
 * The ebuild environment file is located at '/var/tmp/portage/net-ftp/filezilla-3.0.10/temp/environment'.
 * This ebuild is from an overlay: '/usr/local/portage/'
 *


Expected Results:  
succesful compilation as with the manual created wxrc symlink

i think this shoud be the default behavior ( eselect wxwidget creating the wxrc symlink) since i found lots of progs that dont compile (complain about missing wxrc) unless u create the the wxrc symlink

please read the documentation before filing bugs:
http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/bugzilla-howto.xml

devrel is not for ebuild bugs

/usr/bin/wxrc should already exist.  it's a wrapper script that when called from portage points to either wxrc-2.6 or wxrc-2.8 depending on what an ebuild asks for with WX_GTK_VER (or to the currently selected profile if called from outside of portage).  it should have been installed by eselect-wxwidgets.  can you try remerging that package?

with app-admin/eselect-wxwidgets-0.8 the wxrc wrapper script seems to be ok

PS: at the time i filled the bug report the stable version was app-admin/eselect-wxwidgets-0.7-r1 which do not contain the wraper (0.8 was masked back then)

the wrapper has been there since 0.6 so something must have happened to it.  glad to hear you have it working now.
