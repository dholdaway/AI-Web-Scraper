When trying to open a picture attached to an email, thunderbird does nothing.  When trying to save the picture, an error message pops up saying "Unable to save the attachment. Please check your file name and try again later."

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
In 1.5.0.9, when opening an attached picture, thunderbird would ask what I wanted to open it with.

See if you can reproduce it with the bin version.

And try if you can reproduce it with a new profile(backup your profile first!)

It is reproducible in the -bin version.  

Under a new profile, I could open/save a picture that I sent to myself.  When I switched back to my main profile, I could open this email's attached picture.

I have two emails that I received under 1.5.0.9 that 1.5.0.10 has the problem with.  2.0 beta2 will open it without a hitch.  I don't have very many emails with pictures attached.

So this means it's solved or?

Being reproducible with the bin version means it's upstream problem...
