$ euse -a qt5
/usr/bin/euse: line 222: python: command not found
/usr/bin/euse: line 185: python: command not found
/usr/bin/euse: line 185: python: command not found
/usr/bin/euse: line 185: python: command not found
/usr/bin/euse: line 185: python: command not found
/usr/bin/euse: line 203: python: command not found
/usr/bin/euse: line 185: python: command not found

/usr/bin/euse should probably embed $EPYTHON variable.

brian@storm ~/Dev/git/gentoolkit $ euse -a qt5
qt5                 [+  D   ] 
qt5                 [+  D   ] (-qt5)
brian@storm ~/Dev/git/gentoolkit $ 



This has likely been fixed somewhere.  Re-open is still an issue with upcoming release.
