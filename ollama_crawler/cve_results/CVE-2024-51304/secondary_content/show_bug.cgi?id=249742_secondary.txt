I have dev-java/eclipse-ecj-3.4-r3 and dev-java/ant-eclipse-ecj-3.4 installed.

If the line
COMPILERS="ecj-3.4 jikes javac"
is contained in /etc/java-config-2/build/compilers.conf, emerging
dev-java/freemarker-2.3.13 fails.

If the line says
COMPILERS="jikes javac ecj-3.4"
instead, emerging the package works fine.
