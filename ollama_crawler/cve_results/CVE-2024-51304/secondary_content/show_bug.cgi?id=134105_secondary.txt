Hi!
net-fs/nfs-utils doesn't compile on cross-compilation between two different
arches, because the compiler is simply 'gcc', and not '${CHOST}-gc'. To fix
it, is only needed to export CC in src_compile, with tc-export CC.
With the attached patch works to me well between i686, ppc and amd64.

Good bye!
