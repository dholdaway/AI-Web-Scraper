Hello,

The Gentoo Development Guide is great, but does it exist in an off-line version, so that we can browse and read it without internet access (e-Reader, off-line, ...)

Moreover, would it be possible to generate a one-file version (Html, PDF) ?

Thank you very much!


Reproducible: Always

clone here: git://anongit.gentoo.org/devmanual.git
run make
open the thing in a browser

Anything beyond that feel free to submit patches for. I am thinking this strictly thinking provides you off-line access so please open new tickets for any specific improvements like a one-file PDF.

OK, and is there an option to concatenate all pages in one HTML/PDF so that I can search all the documentation ?
