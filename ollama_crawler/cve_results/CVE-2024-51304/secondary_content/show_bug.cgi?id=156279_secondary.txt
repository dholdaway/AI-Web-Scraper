An attempt to emerge dev-perl/DateTime-TimeZone gives the following error.
The file /usr/portage/dev-perl/DateTime-TimeZone/Manifest contains many lines for files that are not in the ebuild.

Created attachment 102737 [details, diff]
Patch to fix Manifest so that ebuild will emerge

I changed the Manifest file until the emerge worked - attached patch contains the changes I made.

Sorry about the duplicate - Bugzilla crashed in my first submision (Internal Server Error), so the second was a duplicate.

Looks fine in CVS, emerge --sync.

My emerge --sync from last night (05:00) yielded this, also emerge from yesterday at the same time, and mirror now says I am up to date. So I cannot confirm that what you say is true unfortunately.
