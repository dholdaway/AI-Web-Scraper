build log

both for http://distfiles.gentoo.org/distfiles/76/cython-0.29.25.gh.tar.gz and for https://github.com/cython/cython/archive/0.29.25.tar.gz, the filesize is not wat is expected. As a consequence, emerging cython-0.29.25 fails

Can you include emerge --info? I did regenerate the Manifest a few days ago.

Thanks Sam, that solved the problem. I avoid syncing the tree while I am completing a new installation.
