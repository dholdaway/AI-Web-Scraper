please test and add keywords if it works

the lack of those keywords currently forced me to mask gog useflag of games-fps/duke3d-data which kinda sucks

You are supposed to drop keywords, not mask USE flags.

SRC_URI="gog? ( setup_duke3d_2.0.0.84.exe )"

That's not a URL, right? Where am I supposed to obtain that file?

That is just wrong. CD-install works for those arches.

I forgot to add fetch restriction. That is fixed now. You have to buy it from gog.

No, that's how we do it. Even if innoextract works as tested on a platform, nothing guarantees that the new duke3d-data ebuild will magically work, too.

I am a very proud owner of the Atomic edition CD. You can keep the USE mask.

It's not happening to you. You're making it happen. Also, attitude.

That doesn't make any sense. The duke3d-data ebuild was tested on all arches. The only difference is the new gog useflag which has NOT been tested except on amd64 and x86.

You seem to mix something up here.

No idea what you are talking about. I have referenced a bug report for portage which should help avoid missing RESTRICT="fetch".

Please keep your useless "attitude" comments to yourself.

I have no idea how that is related to this bug report.

If arch teams do not help, then I will test and keyword it myself.

I said you can keep the USE mask. Put it in profiles/arch/hppa/package.use.mask if you like.

games-fps/duke3d-data gog

Oh wait. You already did.

You got me confused. Will someone test innoextract (NOT DUKE) under hppa now?

No, thanks. The package.use.mask entry is fine.
