For the last few months I have been subscribed to the glsa rss feed, however since I subscribed everytime there is a refresh it wrongly highlights all entries as new, rather then just getting the ones that actually are new. I have confirmed that at least taviso has the same problem as me.

Reassigning to infra... I don't remember who designed the RSS feed.

To the best of my experience, http://www.gentoo.org/rdf/en/glsa-index.rdf is a
fully standards compliant RSS 1.0 feed.

What rss reader are you using?

damn, just as I close it the problem resurfaces. Once again the aggregation
works fine, but each time you update the feed it marks ALL of them as new. I
have verified this on 4 computers at different locations, all using liferea
though I had two people on irc confirm the issue using different rss viewers.

Still have that problem as of 7/nov/2005.

It works with akregator, but not with liferea. The other Gentoo feeds are ok,
though.

frilled, strerror: ping, is this still an issue?
please reopen if it is.

It does work fine for me, but my reader is a little "non-conventional" to say the least.
