Description

I've installed backintime and configured it with "sudo backintime-kde4".
Everything works fine (e.g. cronjobs or backup every reboot) except running it with anacron.

I can see a crontab entry for root:
#Back In Time system entry, this will be edited by the gui:
*/15 * * * * test -x /usr/sbin/anacron && test -e /root/.config/backintime/anacrontab && /usr/sbin/anacron -s -t /root/.config/backintime/anacrontab -S /root/.local/share/backintime/anacron
which seems to be executed (grep anacron /var/log/messages):
Nov  8 16:13:37 gen2 anacron[2381]: Anacron 2.3 started on 2015-11-08
Nov  8 16:13:37 gen2 anacron[2381]: Normal exit (0 jobs run)

Unfortunately 0 backintime jobs have been run and no snapshots are visible in backintime-kde4.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start backintime-kde4 with sudo
2. select schedule with anacron
3. anacron starts but does not start a backintime job
Actual Results:  
anacron does not run a backintime job.

Expected Results:  
anacron starts a backintime job.

Do you have any new informations about that? Does it still exist in backintime-1.1* ?

1.0.36-r2 is the stable version in gentoo.
I've opened a stable request (565150) for 1.1.4 and a verson bump ticket (565148) for 1.1.8.
As soon as a 1.1.* version is in stable I will check if the bug still exists...

with backintime 1.1.4 I'm getting the following when changing the settings:
