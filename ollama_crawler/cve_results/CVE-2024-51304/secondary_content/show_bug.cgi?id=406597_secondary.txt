Debug log as generated by filezilla during the transfer.

I'm trying to use net-ftp/filezilla-3.5.3 to upload a file to a vsftpd 2.3.5 server. A few kilobytes of the file are transferred then the connection stalls and filezilla reconnects. Then the same behaviour starts all over again.

I'll attach a log of filezilla of the transfer until it aborts. I think the last line might be the clue what goes wrong here:

14:38:48	Trace:	First EAGAIN in CTransferSocket::OnSend()

After that line, nothing more is printed, after a short time (a timeout maybe?) filezilla starts reconnecting.

I will gladly provide more information on this if requested.

Using lftp 4.3.5 on the same machine the transfer works without being interrupted.

I could not reproduce it here (with same versions of filezilla and vsftpd). CC-ing vsftpd maintainers for an opinion here.

Did you report this upstream also? I could not find existing bugreports on this problem

Could it be a problem in filezilla? Either way, please report this upstream to vsftpd maintainers.

I can't reproduce it. I use vsftpd + filezilla over ssl and it works just fine
