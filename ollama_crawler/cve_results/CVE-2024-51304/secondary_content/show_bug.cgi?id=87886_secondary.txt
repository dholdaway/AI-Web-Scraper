kde-base/kdebase-meta don't depend on kde-base/kdebase-startkde, kde-base/kdesu, kde-base/konsole and kde-base/konqueror.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~x86" emerge kde-base/kdeaccessibility-meta kde-base/kdeaddons-meta kde-base/kdeadmin-meta kde-base/kdeartwork-meta kde-base/kdebase-meta kde-base/kdegames-meta kde-base/kdegraphics-meta kde-base/kdemultimedia-meta kde-base/kdenetwork-meta kde-base/kdepim-meta kde-base/kdesdk-meta kde-base/kdetoys-meta kde-base/kdeutils-meta

Actual Results:  
KDE instalation don't have startkde, kdesu, konsole and konqueror.


I solved it with:
ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~x86" emerge kde-base/konsole kde-base/kdesu
kde-base/kdebase-startkde kde-base/konqueror

Those dependencies are there, as you can see by looking inside kdebase-meta-3.4.0.ebuild...
