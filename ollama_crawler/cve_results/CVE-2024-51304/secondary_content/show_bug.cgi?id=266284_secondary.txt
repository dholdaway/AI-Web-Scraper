I can't compile Amarok-2.0.90 and amarok-9999 if i enable the ipod support. Does anyone know to fix this problem ? Unfortunately, i don't know how to fix this issue myself. :(

When the ipod support is enabled, i get the following error :

/var/tmp/portage/media-sound/amarok-9999/work/amarok-9999/src/collection/ipodcollection/handler/IpodHandler.cpp: In constructor ‘Ipod::IpodHandler::IpodHandler(IpodCollection*, const QString&, QObject*)’:
/var/tmp/portage/media-sound/amarok-9999/work/amarok-9999/src/collection/ipodcollection/handler/IpodHandler.cpp:87: erreur: ‘g_type_init’ was not declared in this scope
make[2]: *** [src/collection/ipodcollection/CMakeFiles/amarok_collection-ipodcollection.dir/handler/IpodHandler.o] Erreur 1
make[1]: *** [src/collection/ipodcollection/CMakeFiles/amarok_collection-ipodcollection.dir/all] Erreur 2
make[1]: *** Attente des tâches non terminées....

I use libgpod-0.7.0.

Thank you in advance.


Reproducible: Always

I have it building here (2.0.90-r1):
media-sound/amarok-2.0.90-r1 (cdaudio gtk ipod mp3tunes opengl semantic-desktop)
media-libs/libgpod-0.7.0 (hal python)

Please sync and try again.

After synching I still have exactly the same problems as described above.
media-sound/amarok-2.0.90-r1 (ipod opengl semantic-desktop)
media-libs/libgpod-0.7.0 (hal python)

Please attach the full ebuild log and try to rebuild with the "gtk" use flag.

For me, Amarok doesn't compile without the "gtk" flags. If I enable it, it compiles. ;)

Thank you. ;)

this happens to live amarok too. ipod compiles only with gtk. So temporary solution would be to disable the gtk use flag

Enabling the gtk flag and Amarok builds. Still interested in the build log?

Or take advantage of EAPI-2 and add a dep on itself with gtk :P

Nevermind then.
