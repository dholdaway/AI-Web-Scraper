i suggest to split iptables rules-save in four separate rulesets: one for every chain.

/var/lib/iptables/sules-save -> /var/lib/iptables/{filter,mangle,nat,raw}

this can simplify the maintenance on wide firewalls

hardcoding the chains is ugly

post a patch to dynamically save/restore all the chains and we can talk
