I'm wondering, what exactly the dependence on x11-apps/xmessage is good for?

I removed it from the ebuild, built went clean, no errors related to that package. Also compiled it with xmessage in deps and I see no change.

So, since I've never seen an error or an xmessage-window, what exactly is it good for and do we really need it as a forced dep or can't we just remove it or make it a USE, if there's some reason it's needed for some strange stuff?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. try emerging www-client/chromium
2. watch x11-apps/xmessage get pulled in
3. wonder what it's good for

Actual Results:  
xmessage gets pulled in for no apparent reason

Expected Results:  
xmessage shouldn't be pulled in, since it's obviously not really needed

xmessage is used by the chromium launcher script to report errors. This change has been made to avoid doing some checks on compile time and dying in the ebuild. Now the same checks are done at run time. Because people usually open software from the desktop environment menu, some graphical application needs to be used to display the error. xmessage was chosen as the lightest.

Any suggestions how to further improve things are welcome. Especially, feel free to file a bug upstream so chromium can recognize some /dev/shm misconfiguration issues.
