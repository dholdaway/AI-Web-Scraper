Description

          2015-08-17 11:27:12 UTC
        

Many tests fails for p11-kit when an hardened kernel is in use. I don't know if it's because of bad PaX markings or some really nasty code.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. FeATURES="test" emerge -1 p11-kit
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
 * ERROR: app-crypt/p11-kit-0.20.7::gentoo failed (test phase):
 *   Make check failed. See above for details.


Expected Results:  
p11-kit updated on system

I am running pax and have no issue.

not sure what is this and how to resolve, does not seem directly related to p11-kit, but a generic issue.
