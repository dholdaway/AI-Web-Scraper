Sometimes the cookie variables get concatenated together so the cookie is twice
the size it should be. This then gives you a bad request page. This is usually
preceded by the loss of stylesheet info. The solution is to delete the forums
cookies.

This can sometimes be due to weird proxies/browsers.

Closing this one for now, I haven't seen this problem for a long time. I'll re-open it if it occurs again.
