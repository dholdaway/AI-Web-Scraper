kde-base/system-config-printer-kde does not build and I noticed this in the configuration stage:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The following OPTIONAL packages could NOT be located on your system.
-- Consider installing them to enable more features from this software.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   * PyKDE4  <http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/KDE/kdebindings/python/pykde4/>
     PyKDE4 was not found.  It is needed by system-config-printer-kde to run.  (Use -DINSTALL_SYSTEM_CONFIG_PRINTER=TRUE to install anyway)

The build of system-config-printer-kde pretends to be successful, then fails to install.

ImportError: No module named DLFCN

Your system is out of date - you need to update all of python slots.

Also, it seems you are mixing, so (in case the required versions aren't in stable yet) you need to check the ChangeLog to see which versions you need to keyword.

Though, it's uncertain if python slot 2.6 received full fix.

Found Python version: 2.6.6

Is this really the case?
The issue you're reporting is apparently fixed in Python 2.7.2

Please try this.

No idea why it's mixing. I do not have anything related to python in package.keywords.

Regardless, I'm currently doing:
eselect python set python2.7
python-updater
emerge --depclean -av
revdep-rebuild

eselect python set python2.7
python-updater
emerge --depclean
revdep-rebuild
emerge system-config-printer-kde

Problem solved.

INVALID is a bit harsh, WORKSFORME sounds better :)
