 Inside South State Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Expense   Highlight
This could increase our cost of funds, impacting our net interest margin and net interest spread.



 Other - Other   Highlight
Allowance for Credit Losses (“ACL”) on Loans and Certain Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposure

 Other - Other   Highlight
There are risks inherent in all loans, so we maintain an allowance for credit losses to absorb our estimate of probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible.

 Other - Other   Highlight
The Company’s estimate of its ACL involves a high degree of judgment; therefore, management’s process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses.
