# equery d xorg-x11
[ Searching for packages depending on xorg-x11... ]
kde-base/kwin-3.5.2-r1

According to http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/desktop/x/x11/porting-modular-x-howto.xml no package is allowed to depend on a meta package, which I assume xorg-x11 is. I am running kwin without xorg-x11 and it works, so the dependency seems to be wrong.

(It has been reported that media-video/kaffeine-0.7.1 also has this problem, but I have not confirmed it.)

Well no, sorry. You've misread the ebuild. It depends either on the modular libs *or* on xorg-x11.

I did not misread the ebuild. equery did it for me. Maybe the bug is in equery?

no feedback, assuming dupe of bug 101377

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 101377 ***

[ebuild   R   ] app-portage/gentoolkit-0.2.2_pre4  0 kB


Since bug 101377 has been fixed in gentoolkit-0.2.1 and I have this bug with gentoolkit-0.2.2_pre4 it can not be a duplicate of bug 101377.
