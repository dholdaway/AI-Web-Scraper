Description

I have a system that I'm using to connect to my work VPN with "pptpconfig". "pptpconfig" is connecting OK, but it doesn't appear to be saving the /etc/resolv.conf. When I shut down the tunnel, it says it's restoring /etc/resolv.conf, but after it's shut down, the old resolv.conf from the VPN connection is still there.

Looks like it's working now ... I think I had some permission bits corrupted
somewhere in /etc. Anyhow, close this as "Unable to reproduce" or whatever the
Gentoo equivalent is.
