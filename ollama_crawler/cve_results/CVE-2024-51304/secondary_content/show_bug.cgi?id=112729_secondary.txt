After an `emerge sync` I wanted to update world. At alsa-lib-1.0.10_rc3 I got
the error message:

>>> emerge (1 of 2) media-libs/alsa-lib-1.0.10_rc3 to /
!!! Security Violation: A file exists that is not in the manifest.
!!! File: files/alsa-lib-1.0.10_rc3-test.patch

Resyncing 30 minutes later didn't help.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
2.
3.

Definitely not missing here, emerge sync again.

3rd sync (w/ Server Address : 134.68.220.73): still the same
4th sync (w/ Server Address : 134.68.220.97): it still didn't work
5th sync (w/ Server Address : 65.19.163.230): it still didn't work

I'll try later again...
