this variable needs to die but it keeps leaking back in ... a repoman check should help that nicely if it dies whenever someone uses ${IMAGE}

IMAGE was deprecated and stopped being exporting to ebuild environments.  ebuilds that use it will now do odd things (likely not work).  It seems this is no longer an issue for current developers.
