I just renamed lxc-0.7.3; it runs the build (on amd64) without any modifications.

From the first tests, with this release i found no regression issues comparing to 0.7.3

bumped ebuild (renamed copy of lxc-0.7.3-r1)

A temporary fix to use the release candidate sources (0.7.4.rc1) is disabled and may be removed.
