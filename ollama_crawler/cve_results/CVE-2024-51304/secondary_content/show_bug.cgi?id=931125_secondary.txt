Hi all,

i overread the note:

> (IMPORTANT: If this command wants to rebuild glibc first, do *not* let it do     that; instead, abort and try again with --nodeps added to the command line.)

while running: emerge --ask --oneshot sys-devel/gcc

from step 9. of the "2024-03-22-new-23-profiles" (https://www.gentoo.org/support/news-items/2024-03-22-new-23-profiles.html) note.

Should i just continue? Should i restart (somehow)?

Thanks for your help.
Ullrich

I think it's fine to continue (rebuild gcc and then glibc).

Your words in the ears of a higher being ... I will give it a try and report back.

Following the steps (emerge sys-libs/glibc) seems to have worked out for me. The system is stable and no strange errors appared.

Would be nice to know why there is such a big warning when - at least for me - there is no error in rebuilding sys-devel/gcc together with sys-libs/glibc.

Any ways, thanks for your support.
