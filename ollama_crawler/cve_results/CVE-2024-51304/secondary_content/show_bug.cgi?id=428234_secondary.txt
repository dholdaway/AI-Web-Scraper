Description


Dustin C. Hatch

The default installation of sys-libs/glibc does not create the directories in /var necessary for nscd to run. The default configuration in /etc/nscd.conf specifies that passwd, group, and hosts should be cached, however nscd refuses to start with the following errors:

Thu 26 Jul 2012 06:06:24 PM CDT - 23928: cannot create /var/db/nscd/passwd; no sharing possible
Thu 26 Jul 2012 06:06:24 PM CDT - 23928: cannot create /var/db/nscd/group; no sharing possible
Thu 26 Jul 2012 06:06:24 PM CDT - 23928: cannot create /var/db/nscd/hosts; no sharing possible
Thu 26 Jul 2012 06:06:24 PM CDT - 23928: /var/run/nscd/socket: No such file or directory

Creating the directories that are missing (/var/{db,run}/nscd) allows nscd to start without any warnings.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.sudo nscd -d
Actual Results:  
nscd writes errors to stderr indicating that the directories /var/db/nscd and /var/run/nscd are missing. It returns with exit code 1

Expected Results:  
nscd should not write errors and should run successfully

use `/etc/init.d/nscd start`
