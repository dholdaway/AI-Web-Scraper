Having problems updating perl to 5.20 with modules still pointing to 5.18 in portage. I don't think that this is the problem.

Posting build.log

Sorry I meant ported or updated, not pointing

Did you run "perl-cleaner --all" ?

> Did you run "perl-cleaner --all" ?

I just profiled kernel and my machine has slowed a bit, but I was able to get perl-5.20 to emerge with :

emerge --deselect and --ask $(qlist -IC 'perl-core/*') && emerge -u1a $(qlist -IC 'virtual/perl-*')

: Now perl-cleaner --reallyall works fine, and net-libs/gnutls-3.3.10-r2 emerges clean.

Thanks
