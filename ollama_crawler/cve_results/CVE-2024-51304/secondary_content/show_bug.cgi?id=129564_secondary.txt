Description

          2006-04-11 01:10:00 UTC
        

seems that the qt-3.3.4-r9.ebuild has a minor problem running on a x86 arch, the configure script seems to come out as -rw-------, meaning emerge will stop cause it cant execute the script.

and yes, i did a workaround, just adding a chmod 755 on the configure file in the ebuild and running it in /usr/local/portage, still its annoying when you start your take-a-night-emerge and find it broke 2 mins after you went to bed, though...

I just tried:

tcdevel qt # ebuild qt-3.3.4-r9.ebuild unpack
...

tcdevel qt # ls /var/tmp/portage/qt-3.3.4-r9/work/qt-x11-free-3.3.4/configure -l
-rwxrwxr-x 1 root portage 107804 Apr 13 07:54 /var/tmp/portage/qt-3.3.4-r9/work/qt-x11-free-3.3.4/configure
