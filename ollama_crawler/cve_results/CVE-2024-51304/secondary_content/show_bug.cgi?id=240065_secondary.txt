I don't know the build system for this program (and this is a generic bug template so I cannot tell you which program exactly is), but my tests shows that it's not respecting CFLAGS properly.

Please look into it, since it's important to respect user CFLAGS.

Thanks,
Diego

make xermit KTARGET=${KTARGET:-linuxa} "CC = gcc" "CC2 = gcc" \                                                                            
        "CFLAGS = -O2 -march=core2 -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe -DLINUX -pipe -funsigned-char -DFNFLOAT -DCK_POSIX_SIG \                     
        -DCK_NEWTERM -DTCPSOCKET -DLINUXFSSTND -DNOCOTFMC -DPOSIX \                                                                        
        -DUSE_STRERROR -DCK_NCURSES -I/usr/include/ncurses -D_XOPEN_SOURCE -D_BSD_SOURCE -DHAVE_PTMX  -DHAVE_CRYPT_H -DCK_SHADOW"


looks fine to me.
