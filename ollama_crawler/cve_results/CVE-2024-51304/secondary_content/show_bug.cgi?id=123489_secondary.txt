I just emerged xorg-x11-7.0-r1 and did an emerge -up world --deep afterwards. it seems like libwmf wants to downgrade xorg-x11:

[nomerge      ] media-gfx/gimp-print-4.2.7  USE="-gtk*"
[nomerge      ]  media-gfx/imagemagick-6.2.5.5  USE="-bzip2* -lcms* -minimal%"
[nomerge      ]   media-libs/libwmf-0.2.8.2
[ebuild  N    ]    virtual/x11-6.8
[ebuild     UD]     x11-base/xorg-x11-6.8.2-r6 [7.0-r1]

this is probably a wrong set dependency

With modular X, use 0.2.8.3-r1
