Description

In section 7e the step

   Code Listing 5.1: Viewing all available modules

   # find /lib/modules/<kernel version>/ -type f -iname '*.o' -or -iname '*.ko'

is mentioned.

This does list all the available modules, however, from the standard terminal at this point in the install it quickly goes off screen.

I redirected the output into a text file and used nano to view it. 

The installation manual could usefully add steps to do this.

Is there any reason why we can't use `modprobe -l` instead of find?

That only does it for the currently running kernel. Which is not the one that was just compiled and installed. And since it only works for one kernel, that doesn't help if the user has multiple kernels/versions installed, whereas with "find" you get to pick which kernel version you want to examine.

Also, the manpage for modprobe itself suggests using the "find" approach, rather than using "-l", which modprobe says is provided only for compatibility reasons.
