Description

FYI:

  2.6.26 kernel

If you are using a 2.6.26 kernel, you are supposed to use the regular ACPI backlight control instead of thinkpad-acpi, on any Lenovo (Windows Vista-capable) ThinkPad.

Modify the kernel config by first disabling CONFIG_THINKPAD_ACPI_VIDEO and then enabling both CONFIG_VIDEO_OUTPUT_CONTROL and CONFIG_ACPI_VIDEO [2] While you are at it, be sure to read the well-written help sections for the kernel config settings :)

Reproducible: Always

I haven't needed to do this for my thinkpad. Until there's some credible evidence for exactly which models this helps and why, the guide will stay as-is. Using thinkpad_acpi with recent kernels certainly doesn't hurt my R61i.
