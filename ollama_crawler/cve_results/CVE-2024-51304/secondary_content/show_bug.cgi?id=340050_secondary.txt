Description

It seems that some updates of some screen areas are delayed indefinitely. Most often this happens in games. E.g., in kmines, I put a flag at a square. But the flag image does not appear. The game knows that the flag is set. Later, when something is updated near this square, it gets updated too. Or in pysol, a card is flying to its destination position, and suddenly freeses before reaching it. Later, when I move something near it, this frozen card jumps to its place. But sometimes such effects happen, e.g., in firefox. None of this happened in 4.4.x.

I heard I should switch off "blur" in "desktop effects". I did this. No improvement. Maybe, I should switch off something else?

Reproducible: Always

I no longer see this behaviour in kde-4.5.2, 4.5.3. Closing.
