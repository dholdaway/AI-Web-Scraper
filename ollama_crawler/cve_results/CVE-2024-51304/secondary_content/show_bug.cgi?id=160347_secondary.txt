To start with: this should go as elog (the command) instead of einfo.

The following message is pretty fuzzy:

To use NetworkManager disable all entries on runlevels
net.***X and run /etc/init.d/NetworkManager
you can add to runlevels writing on your terminal
rc-update add NetworkManager default

And for wired dhcp-interface it just seems to need:
echo modules_eth0=( "dhclient" ) >> /etc/conf.d/net && eselect rc add NetworkManager

Ok i accept the idea but can you explain better what you are thinking ? About the eselect thingy you are talking about a switcher between baselayout net and NM ? Patches are welcome :).

What I mean is that baselayout uses by default dhcpcd as its dhcp-client, but you can specify your own with modules_name-of-interface in /etc/conf.d/net and by specify dhclient as mine dhcp-client for my interfaces I have avoided all troubles associated with disabling net.* (for examples some other services like sshd acted strangely for me).
And when dhcdbd starts up it seems to take control over the already running dhclient instead of (like many have complained over) starting it's own sided with dhcpcd.
This works for wired-networks at least, but I have not had the ability trying it out with wireless.

The eselect-thing is just me using 'eselect rc' instead of 'rc-update'.

When it comes to the message in the ebuild: currently it is very unclear what it means at all. It may be a placeholder until you are sure how to handle NetworkManager within gentoo but in its current form it is just plain confusing.
Do you mean something like:

"To use NetworkManager you have to disable all net.***X and run /etc/init.d/NetworkManager. To start NetworkManager at boot enter the command 'rc-update add NetworkManager default'."

Well, dhcdbd requires dhcp, not dhcpcd or anything else, this is from upstream, nothing that we can do about it.  I still don't understand what you are meaning by the postinstall instructions.  The postinstall is simply a quick pointer, not a README.
