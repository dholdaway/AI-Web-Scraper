Description

Compiling knetworkmanager gives a warning
WARNING: `automake-1.10' is probably too old.  You should only need it if
         you modified `Makefile.am', `acinclude.m4' or `configure.in'.
         You might want to install the `Automake' and `Perl' packages.
         Grab them from any GNU archive site.

and then it fails with

                 from /usr/include/netlink/route/link.h:15,

downgrading automake to automake-1.10 fixes the problem.

Please do not assign bugs without reading metadata.xml or simply do not assign them yourself. Bringing in Robert.

Which version of dev-libs/libnl do you have installed? Please add your emerge --info.

I think I had 1.0pre6 installed at the time. Anyways I can't seem to be able to reproduce this anymore so this can be closed.
