Description

The quakeforge ebuild currently builds all optional tools(pak, qflight, qfvis, etc.) by default. Since tool building can be enabled/disabled by configure, perhaps a use flag should be added?

Reproducible: Always

You can already control which are installed by setting QF_TOOLS. List them like QF_TOOLS=bsp2img,carne,pak,qfbsp or QF_TOOLS=no to disable them all.
