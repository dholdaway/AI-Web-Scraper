[ebuild   R   ] media-sound/audacious-1.3.1  USE="chardet nls"

Audacious won't retain my songs in the playlist if I quit the program.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start audacious and load songs, because they weren't saved from last time
2.Play audacious, songs play fine
3.Quit, playlist empty are gone when the player starts up again

Actual Results:  
playlist is empty are gone when the player starts up again


Expected Results:  
playlist should be there when I start the player

This happens with the ALSA and JACK plugins.

I am unable to reproduce this bug on:
- X86
- PPC
- PPC64

The provided testcase is insufficient. If you want to reopen this bug, you will have to provide a *lot* more information.

For reference, this is the additional information that will be required:
1) an actual test case
2) emerge --info
3) emerge -pv audacious audacious-plugins
4) whether unmerging any and all third-party plugins have an effect on the problem
5) running audacious from a terminal and capturing any and all messages emitted

I got this output below, from running audacious in a terminal. It apparently didn't like the song "Loves Gonna get you by BDP" once I removed that mp3 from the directory I had been loading my music files from the playlist loaded fine. I can send you the mp3 if you'd like this song used to not cause a problem for audacious so I don't know what changed.

I consider this resolved for me, at this point, since it's only one song.
