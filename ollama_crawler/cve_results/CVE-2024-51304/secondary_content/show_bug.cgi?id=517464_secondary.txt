build

Bootstrapping on OS X 10.9.4, once the unrelated python issues have been dealt with, fails on groff-1.22.2. Deparallelizing the build seems to resolve the problem.

cd ${EPREFIX}
mkdir -p etc/portage/env
echo 'MAKEOPTS="-j1"' > etc/portage/env/deparallelize
echo '=sys-apps/groff-1.22.2::gentoo_prefix deparallelize' >> etc/portage/package.env

I think the cause is bug #258291, keeping this bug open to work around the problem at bootstrap time.

Is this reproducible for you?

make[2]: *** read jobs pipe: No such file or directory.  Stop

I think this is more make than groff.  WFIW I didn't experience this when bootstrapping.
