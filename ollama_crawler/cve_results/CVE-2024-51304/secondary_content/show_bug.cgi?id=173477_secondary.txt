The link provide some information to make webmin use Apache as web server instead of miniserve.pl.
Could be a good option to add in the ebuild.

Reproducible: Always

This ebuild already supports apache, no idea what you mean.

Not sure you get my point. I don't want to use Webmin to configure Apache2 but use Apache2 as web server for webmin instead of miniserv.pl.
Have a look at the link, at least the first sentence:

"Webmin comes with a very simple webserver called miniserv.pl that is capable of doing all that is necessary for Webmin to run. However, it is not as fast or memory efficient as a well-developed server such as Apache. To use Apache instead of miniserv.pl, follow these steps :"
