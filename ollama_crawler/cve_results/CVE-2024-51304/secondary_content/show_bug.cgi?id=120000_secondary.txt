when configuring kdelibs, I get the following:

configure: error: --with-utempter was given, but test for utempter failed

Yes, and it depends on it, look at the ebuild.

I have this problem also.

looks like /usr/lib/libutempter.so should be a symlink, but it doesn't exist. /usr/lib/utempter.so.0.5.5 does, and .0 and .0.5 are symlinks to it.

Will see if adding it allows kdelibs to compile.

equery f utempter says it should be there, but its not.. what's up with that?
