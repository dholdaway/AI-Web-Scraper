Description

I recently added the following line in /etc/make.conf:

EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS="-v"

With this option and a recent ~x86 portage version (eg: 2.1_pre6-r3), the revdep-rebuild tool breaks.

The reason, I think, is that it uses the "emerge" command with specific flags, and parses its output. Because of EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS, the output can change. In my case, for example, it receives info about USE flags that it doesn't expect.

Workaround: don't use EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS with revdep-rebuild

Solution:
(a) adding a flag to emerge, like --clear-opts, which ignores EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS
(b) change every call in revdep-rebuild to call emerge as follows: 'EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS="" emerge xyz'

Works just fine with gentoolkit-0.2.2_pre3

Sorry.. yes, I stupidly forgot to update gentoolkit (version 0.2.1 was still installed).

Thanks :-)
