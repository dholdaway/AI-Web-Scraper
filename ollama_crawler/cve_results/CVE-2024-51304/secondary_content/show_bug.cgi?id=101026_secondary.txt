COMPILE_ET is overridden on the cmdline ...

can you post the output of `emerge info --verbose` please

Created attachment 65628 [details]
emerge info --verbose

I experience a very similar error when attempting to emerge e2fsprogs-1.38.  I
had previously downgraded to 1.35 due to a bug that was introduced in 1.36 and
has not yet been fixed.

Additionally, my system is moderately hosed due to a libcom_err.so problem, as
described here (by someone else):

Can you:

   # cd /var/tmp/portage/e2fsprogs-1.38/work/e2fsprogs-1.38/lib/ext2fs
   # make COMPILE_ET=compile_et

And see if that passes ?

Same here...after a downgrade to 1.35, it is not possible to have 1.38
anymore...And as to comment 3, nope it did not work:

COMPILE_ET ext2_err.et
make: compile_et: Command not found
make: *** [ext2_err.h] Error 127

do you not have com_err-1.38 installed ?  you should have /usr/bin/compile_et on
your system ...

I think I should make the problem precise first: I downgraded to e2fsprogs 1.35
(don't ask why) and everything was fine. Then I decided to go back to 1.38 and
the emerge went fine there too. However, although it emerged, fsck and similar
did not function with the libcom_err.so not found complaints. Then I did a
revdep-rebuild hoping to fix the missing libs and revdep-rebuild wanted to
reemerge e2fsprogs and failed to compile it with the compile_et: Command not
found error.

Now I seemed to have fixed it by RE-emerging both sys-libs/com_err-1.38 and
sys-libs/ss-1.38 (thx comment 5) then e2fsprogs emerge went sucessfully.
However, I am still not sure if there is a bug related to downgrading to 1.35
and then back up to 1.38.
