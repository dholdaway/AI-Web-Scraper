Description


Andriy Baranskyy





          2012-09-18 00:33:15 UTC
        

I am using wifi card:
03:00.0 Network controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL8188CE 802.11b/g/n WiFi Adapter (rev 01)
It utilises the following in-kernel modules: rtl8192ce, rtl8192c_common and rtlwifi and uses firmware from linux-firmware package. My kernel: 3.5.3.

After upgrading to linux-firware-20120909 (which includes updated firmware and firware to new driver rtlwifi/rtl8723e) I started experiencing connectivity issues. My computer maintains connection with a wifi router; however, Internet connection disappears every few minutes for 30-60 seconds. I have checked and other devices do not experience this issue. Downgrading to linux-firmware-20120816 brings back stable internet connection.

I do not see any error messages in dmesg. Please let me know if any additional logs can be provided and if I need to send a bug upstream.

Sorry for a potentially vague bug report.

This is a bit strange, as there was only the addition of rtl8723 firmware between these two snapshots. Can you provide md5sum of the working and the non-working firmware file? (only the particular file that is used for your wifi card)

Please also check that your wireless regulatory domain is set correctly.
# iw reg get

If the issue persists with the latest 3.6_rc kernel, it is probably a good idea to report this to the linux-wireless mailing list linux-wireless@vger.kernel.org

I am sorry, but how do I find the specific non-working firmware file? [I know this is a basic question, but googling has not returned much].

localhost ~ # iw reg get
country 00:
        (2402 - 2472 @ 40), (6, 20)
        (2457 - 2482 @ 20), (6, 20), PASSIVE-SCAN, NO-IBSS
        (2474 - 2494 @ 20), (6, 20), NO-OFDM, PASSIVE-SCAN, NO-IBSS
        (5170 - 5250 @ 40), (6, 20), PASSIVE-SCAN, NO-IBSS
        (5735 - 5835 @ 40), (6, 20), PASSIVE-SCAN, NO-IBSS

I just changed this to country CA and will monitor the performance.


Perhaps, we can close this bug for now and I will check whether the problem persists with 3.6 when it becomes available?

You will probably have a dmesg line that reads similar to this:
rtl8192c_common: Loading firmware file ...

Is that the working or the non-working firmware file? And what is the md5sum of the other one?

Yes, this is the one! There are no others.
I have played with the wifi card and router. Switched the router from g/n setting to n setting and the wifi card has been behaving well for the last ten hours.
Let's close this bug for now. If the problem reappears and it is related, I will reopen the bug and provide more details.
