Description

When using the command:

  /sbin/dchpcd -h Atlas -N -I Linux eth0

dhcpcd version 3.0.16-r1 fails to set the client identifier properly.  Ethereal dumps show that the client identifier is set to "eth0" and not "Linux".  Downgrading to dhcpcd version 2.0.5-r1 works correctly, with no modification to the configuration files.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. /etc/conf.d/net is:
config_eth0=( "dhcp" )
dhcpcd_eth0="-N -I Linux"
2. /etc/init.d/net.eth0 start
3. Ethereal dump network traffic on DHCP server.

Actual Results:  
"eth0" is sent as the client identifier.

Expected Results:  
The proper client identifier should be sent.

dhcpcd-3.1.1 has the fix.
