Diego, can you reproduce this bug with net-libs/wvstreams-4.6.1? It looks like this bug is fixed there:

tablet wvstreams-4.6.1 # readelf -d /usr/lib64/libwvdbus.so | grep NEEDED
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libwvstreams.so.4.6]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libwvutils.so.4.6]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libwvbase.so.4.6]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libdbus-1.so.3]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libstdc++.so.6]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libgcc_s.so.1]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libc.so.6]

... and I don't see anything suspicious in configure.ac. So I guess this bug is fixed, if not, please, reopen.
