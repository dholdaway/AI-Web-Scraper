Can't recompile this package. I've updated my system to jpeg-8 and I have preserved packages.
So portage wants to rebuild wxGTK (that installed just fine in 09/30/2009). Now won't install itself anymore.

I think it's related to glibc (I've found other similar issues that have been closed time ago).

This can be a valid bug, if it's a STABLEREQ
for a later revision of wxGTK (see ChangeLog).

next stable is -r4 which won't be until Feb.  just unmask >= -r3 until then.
