Description

Whenever I try to start wmmixer, I get the following error:

*** glibc detected *** malloc(): memory corruption: 0x08094c38 ***
Aborted

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Emerge wmmixer
2.Start wmmixer

Actual Results:  
*** glibc detected *** malloc(): memory corruption: 0x08094c38 ***
Aborted

Expected Results:  
wmmixer should start.

The corruption address is the same every time.  I've run memtest86+ and found no
problems with my ram.

I'm attempting to start it from within fluxbox.

Sorry, I can't reproduce it.
