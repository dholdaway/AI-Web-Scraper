sys-libs/gpm-1.20.1-r5

Request flag based installation of gpm-root and /etc/init.d/gpm-root init script

flag "gpm-root" would install the needed init scripts and also compile (or don't, if -flag) gpm-root.

Uhm? gpm already installs init script and installs gpm-root binary. Don't see what are you requesting.

I was requesting init scripts to start gpm-root at boot, as current gpm package only adds the init scripts for gpm, not gpm-root.

The scripts could be enabled with flag based behaviour. If flag gpm-root is present, the gpm-root init scripts are installed.
