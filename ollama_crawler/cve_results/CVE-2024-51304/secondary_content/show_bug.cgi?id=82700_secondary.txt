There is an example in the manpage of libnm. Here are some lines of it:
        for (row = 0; row < inpam.height; row++) {
            pnm_readpamrow(&inpam, tuplerow);
            for (column = 0; column < inpam.width; column++) {
                for (sample = 0; sample < inpam.depth; column++) {
                    grand_total += tuplerow[row][column][sample];
                }
            }
            pnm_writepamrow(&outpam, tuplerow); }

There are two errors. In the third 'for', there should be "sample++". And in the access to tuplerow, it should be:  tuplerow[column][sample]
