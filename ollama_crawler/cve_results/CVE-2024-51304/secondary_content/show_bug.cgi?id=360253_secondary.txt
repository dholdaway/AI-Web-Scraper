Description

          2011-03-24 10:51:05 UTC
        

Immediately after loading xen.gz boot fails with following message:

Error message:
===========
Panic on CPU 0:
Xen BUG at i387.c:159

It is occuring only on Intel CPUs.
It seems it is a known bug, fixed in 4.0.2rc1-pre, but as of now, there's a workaround, one should add "no-xsave" as an option to Xen command line in grub.conf

Perhaps ebuild should contain a message about it.
