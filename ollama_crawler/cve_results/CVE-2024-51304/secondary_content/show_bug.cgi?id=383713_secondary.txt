On 393 line I found:
virtual void get( cOnst KUrl& url );
but expected:
virtual void get( const KUrl& url );

Reproducible: Always




I think, this simple path solve the problem.

Not in the git version, not in the release tarball, not on my system, and it's not touched by any patch. 

(And the line has not been changed for a while in git.)

Sorry, but this looks like a flipped bit on your box. Try reinstalling kdelibs.
