Description

Problem: php files are displayed as text rather than processed by mod_php.

Resolution: move 70_mod_php.conf from /etc/apache2/modules.d to
/etc/apache2/conf/modules.d. Then comment out the AddDirectoryIndex line,
AddDirectoryIndex is not mentioned in the Apache documentation and causes an
error starting apache. 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.

The problem seems to be in the eclass.

depend.apache.eclass:APACHE2_MODULES_CONFDIR="${APACHE2_CONFDIR}/modules.d"
depend.apache.eclass:APACHE2_CONFDIR="/etc/apache2"

The APACHE2_CONFDIR= should read:  APACHE2_CONFDIR="/etc/apache2/conf"

mod_php-4.4* is incompatible and not intended for use with stable apache version
with the old layout. The locations are valid for >=net-www/apache-2.0.54-r10.

The problem w/ the invalid AddDirectoryIndex directive still seems to exist for
4.3.11-r2 and 4.4.0; it seems like it's used in invalid context (Bug 90120).

dev-php/mod_php-4.4.0 is to be used with the current stable version of Apache,
dev-php/mod_php-4.4.0-r1 is to be used with the current unstable version of Apache.
