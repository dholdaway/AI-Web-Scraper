Description

On my Gentoo,
ip_::1 -> ip_127.0.0.1
(the "ip_" script).

After restarting the service, I connect using telnet localhost 4949, and ask the list of active plugins. None of the IPv6 ip_ plugins are listed by the daemon. Web page shows all other plugins, including all other IPv4 ones (the server has many IPs). 

The IP_ script seem to be the same as on my debian; on debian, they are listed, and shown on the web page. I have absolutely no clue where the problem could be. File names are identical on both machines; ip_ script is not identical, but really close. Plugin is configured.

I did not reboot yet, but even when a restart could but, and stop and start should do it.

I have run ip6 tables, and ip6tables -L -n show them as declared properly; even if it was not the case, the node should still list the plugins as available.

munin-node.log and syslog don't show anything special.

uranus plugins # ./ip_127.0.0.1 config
