http://www.gentoo.org/dyn/use-index.xml
it says
1. Global Use Flags
branding: Enable Gentoo specific branding

This entry does not really document anything. Does it mean new features? Different pachset? Does it mean one thing for one package, and an other for a different one? (In this case it should be enumerated separately for separate packages, not system-wide)

Reproducible: Always

It means having a Gentoo logo on a application splash screen and stuff like that. Nothing you'd call a feature, unless you see branding as a feature.

Ok, then I see. Maybe this entry should contain this extra info.
Now this entry isn't informative: "branding means branding" (this is the current state a bit exaggerated). You do not state what you mean under branding

It would be informative to say: "branding means having gentoo logos on splash screens"

imho. Have a nice day!
