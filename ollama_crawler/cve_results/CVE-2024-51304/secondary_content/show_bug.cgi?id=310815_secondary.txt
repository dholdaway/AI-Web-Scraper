I don't have time to double-check whether or not the tarball passes md5sum, but after downloading, extracting, redownloading, and reextracting, ending with errors each time (couldn't get tar to give me a specific error, I apologize), I have reason to believe that the package is corrupted.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download
2. Extract
3. Wait for the error.

Actual Results:  
Tar errors out.

Expected Results:  
Tar should have completed without complaints.

I tried off of another mirror, and the tarball extracted just fine.

Hi,
Everything looks ok to me from that mirror. Thanks for filing the bug, but I don't see anything wrong at this moment.

%% md5sum -c stage3-i686-20100216.tar.bz2.DIGESTS 
stage3-i686-20100216.tar.bz2: OK
stage3-i686-20100216.tar.bz2.CONTENTS: OK
