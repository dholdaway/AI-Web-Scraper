Commenting on the results, John Wasson, chair and chief executive officer, said, “Fourth quarter results represented a solid finish to a year of double-digit revenue growth for ICF, which demonstrated the benefits of our expanded capabilities in key growth markets and the strength of our diversified business model. Revenues increased 1% year-on-year. Adjusting for the divestiture of our commercial marketing business lines during 2023, fourth quarter revenue increased 5% year-on-year, led by strong growth in revenues from commercial energy clients and our state and local and international government clients.

 Inside Icf International, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
If any of these estimates, assumptions or judgments prove to be incorrect, our reported results could be materially affected.



 Other - Other   Highlight
We believe that the estimates, assumptions, and judgments involved in the accounting practices described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements and, therefore, consider them to be critical accounting policies.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
We use a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the income tax position taken to evaluate uncertain tax positions.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
The decrease in our general and administrative costs was primarily from lower facilities expense that was, in part, attributed to our Fairfax lease ending at the end of the 2022 fiscal year.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Our cost estimate is based on our prior experience and expertise in delivery of similar services, which allow us to make reasonable assumptions and estimates that are close to actual costs to complete the obligations; however, changes in the scope or complexity of work, availability of materials needed, or performance could cause a change in the EAC.
