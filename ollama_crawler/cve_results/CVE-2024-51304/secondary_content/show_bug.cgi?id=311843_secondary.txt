Description


Cavin

In section 4.e., it is suggested to use the following commands to mount the newly created filesystem:

# mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/gentoo
# mkdir /mnt/gentoo/boot
# mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/gentoo/boot

However, that was not correct when doing this myself. The third command complained about needing to specify a filesystem.

To fix this I just used:

# mount -t tmpfs /dev/sda1 /mnt/gentoo/boot



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Do this with the latest live minimal disk.

Actual Results:  
Error

Expected Results:  
No error

Can't reproduce. Works for me.
