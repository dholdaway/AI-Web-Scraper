 Inside Coupang, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Management believes that these assumptions are critical accounting estimates because significant changes in these assumptions could impact our results of operations and financial position.



 Financial - Expense   Highlight
If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, given the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, and due to the unforeseen effects of the current global macroeconomic environment, those estimates required increased judgment, and actual results reported in future periods could differ materially from those estimates and assumptions.

 Other - Other   Highlight
If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could record impairment charges.
