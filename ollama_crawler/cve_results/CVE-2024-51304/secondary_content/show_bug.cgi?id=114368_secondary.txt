Description


Jan Hrabe

The cron keeps creating dead.letter file in /root containing only lines

/bin/bash: root: command not found
...

I suspects it expects something like sendmail being available.  However,
it emerges and runs without indicating this dependency.  The dead.letter
file is recreated very fast, much more sooner than cron.hourly script
are run.  Therefore, the problem cannot be caused by the scripts in
cron.hourly and friends.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. rm /root/dead.letter
2. /etc/init.d/vixie-cron start
3. wait a few minutes
4. tail -f /root/dead.letter

No. It inherits cron eclass which RDEPENDS on virtual/mta.
