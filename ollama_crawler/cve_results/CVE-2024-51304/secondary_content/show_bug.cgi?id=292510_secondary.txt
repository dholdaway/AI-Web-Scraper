I don't know if there's some sort of API breakage or what with this version but I'm seeing the same problem. Gitosis also seems to be affected by this problem.

i can confirm the same problem with gitosis, it is looking for setuptools 0.6c5 though. upgrading to 0.6.6 does the trick

dev-python/setuptools-0.6.6 is already being stabilized in bug #291915.

Nice, how does that fix this bug for stable users until it is stabilized?
