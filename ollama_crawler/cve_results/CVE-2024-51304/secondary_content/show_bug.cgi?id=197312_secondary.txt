According to http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=183781, Mumble needs the latest Speex beta. This issue is holding back Mumble 1.1.0 from being included into portage.

Speex on their download page actually recommends 1.2beta1 over the stable version (which makes one wonder why 1.2 isn't stable, but whatever).

Reproducible: Always
