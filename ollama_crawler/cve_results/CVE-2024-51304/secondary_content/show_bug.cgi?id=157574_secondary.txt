ivman needs to depend on more: it's possible to emerge it and have configure fail.  Not sure what it would depend on, maybe glib+dbus together.

Here's the output:

n2 dbus # emerge -v ivman dbus
.
.
.
checking pkg-config is at least version 0.9.0... yes
checking for LIBXML... yes
checking for GLIB... yes
checking for DBUS_GLIB... configure: error: No Dbus-Glib found, check config.log for failed attempts

!!! Please attach the following file when filing a report to bugs.gentoo.org:
!!! /var/tmp/portage/ivman-0.6.12/work/ivman-0.6.12/config.log

!!! ERROR: sys-apps/ivman-0.6.12 failed.
Call stack:
  ebuild.sh, line 1546:   Called dyn_compile
  ebuild.sh, line 937:   Called src_compile
  ivman-0.6.12.ebuild, line 26:   Called econf '--disable-debug'
  ebuild.sh, line 540:   Called die

!!! econf failed
!!! If you need support, post the topmost build error, and the call stack if relevant.

n2 dbus # emerge -vp ivman dbus

These are the packages that would be merged, in order:

Calculating dependencies... done!
[ebuild  N    ] sys-apps/ivman-0.6.12  USE="-debug" 0 kB 
[ebuild  N    ] sys-apps/dbus-1.0.1-r2  USE="X -debug -doc (-selinux)" 1,373 kB 

Total size of downloads: 1,373 kB

sys-apps/ivman depends on hal which has all the needed dbus dependencies. I really fail to see how can you have sys-apps/hal installed without dbus.

Since ivman directly uses dbus-glib, it should depend on dbus-glib.

As said, hal already depends on it...
