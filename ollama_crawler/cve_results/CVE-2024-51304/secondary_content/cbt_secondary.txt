 Sean Keohane, Cabot President and Chief Executive Officer commented: "I am pleased that we were able to deliver adjusted EPS of $1.65 in the fourth quarter, which represents a 6% year-over-year improvement and the strongest quarter of our
            fiscal year 2023. We delivered adjusted EPS of $5.38 for fiscal year 2023 despite lower demand in key end markets, a weak environment in China, and significant levels of customer destocking. We proactively navigated a challenging
            macro-environment by implementing strict cost management measures and demonstrating strong commercial execution to sustain robust margins. I am also pleased with the strong cash performance in the fiscal year, where we generated $595 million in
            operating cash flow. We used this robust cash flow generation to maintain our assets, invest for growth and return cash to shareholders. We paid $88 million in dividends, including an 8% increase announced in May, and we repurchased $98 million
            of shares. We also made significant strides in our sustainability agenda with the launch of our EVOLVE® Sustainable Solutions technology platform during the year, which we believe presents an exciting opportunity to offer our customers
            sustainable reinforcing carbons and other materials to meet their needs for increased circularity.”

 Inside Cabot Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Revenue - Product   Highlight
EBIT in Performance Chemicals decreased by $109 million compared to the same period of fiscal 2022 due to lower volumes ($51 million), lower unit margins ($43 million), the unfavorable impact of a reduction in inventory levels ($10 million) and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation ($10 million).



 Revenue - Product   Highlight
In fiscal 2023, sales in Performance Chemicals decreased by $163 million compared to the same period of fiscal 2022 due to lower volumes ($65 million), the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation ($42 million), less favorable pricing and product mix (combined $49 million) and lower by-product revenue ($6 million).

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
The decrease was primarily due to lower volumes ($147 million), the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation ($86 million) and lower by-product revenue ($24 million), partially offset by improved price and product mix (combined $148 million).

 Financial - Debt   Highlight
The cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2022 primarily consisted of net proceeds from long-term debt of $22 million, which consisted of proceeds of $394 million less repayments of $372 million, net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper of $250 million, and proceeds from short-term borrowings of $26 million, partially offset by dividend payments to stockholders of $84 million, purchases of common stock of $53 million and dividend payments to noncontrolling interests of $22 million.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
Higher unit margins in the Reinforcement Materials segment ($128 million) were primarily due to improved pricing and product mix in our calendar year 2023 annual tire customer agreements.
