Chromium build fails; looks like during v8 compilation.  Build log and environment will be uploaded shortly.

In file included from ../../v8/src/property.h:14:0,
                 from ../../v8/src/objects-inl.h:32,

 };

Either your toolchain is broken, you have some bad memory, or something else quite strange happend.

RAM's fine (or memtest isn't...) but I'll rebuild the toolchain and/or try the sledgehammer of an 'emerge -e chromium' as I'm at a loss to find any other explanation!
