Description

I have had aMSN-0.94 for over a year and it has worked flawlessly until about a
week ago, when it started to crash on every try to log in. At first it only
crashed when choosing unicode, now it crashes whatever encoding I choose.

Starting aMSN in the terminal window i get the following error message:

$ amsn
X Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)
  Major opcode of failed request:  45 (X_OpenFont)
  Value in failed request:  0x2c0013f
  Serial number of failed request:  3820
  Current serial number in output stream:  3821

I have looked for help on Google, but I do not find so much. On one site I was
told to delete the config.xml in .amsn, but there is no such file at all any more.

I kinda depend on this app as Gaim is unable to send files over msn.

I do not remember all upgrades, but I do emerge -uDav world every morning.

Funny thing, though, I have two hotmail accounts - it only crashes with
linsefan@hotmail.com. When I start it with borje_holmberg@hotmail.com it is ok?

I also have aMSN on the other computer within the network (archlinux) and i have
no problem with linsefan@hotmail.com on that one.

Seems the Gentoo aMSN doesn't like my linsefan hotmail account - hehe

I am very confused.

I think this is about amsn not finding a font its looking for..

In .amsn/<accoutname>/config.xml.. take the value of "mychatfont" and "basefont"
and copy it from the working to the non-working account and see if it works better.

If that doesnt work, in .amsn/<brokenaccount>/config.xml, you can try setting
"disableuserfonts" to 0 and make sure the fonts in there are availabel to X (you
can check with xfontsel). Also make sure the font in .amsn/gconfig.xml are
available too.

Goodness gracious, all this ado :( It seems to be too tough a job for me - hehe.

Is there no easier way? What might have gone wrong - why does it work from
scratch with one account, but not with another???

I used to love Gentoo, but I am getting a bit bored with it lately.

Thank you any way for your most kind try, but this is jeopardizing my health.

hey this isnt a gentoo bug.. its a amsn bug ;) ... if you want an easy solution
you can copy over the whole config.xml file from the working to the broken
account and see if it works.. oh and keep a backup of the one from the broken
account, just in case ;)

You are right :) It is not Gentoo... but it is within Gentoo - hehe

Well, the suggested easy fix did not work... I guess Gaim is the only app that
will work with messenger on this install.

Thanks for trying, just delete this bug. I will give up on aMSN and Gentoo,
although I feel furious and will probably switch distro soon. It is not your
fault. I just feel Gentoo takes too much time and work, which I could use for
more rewarding things.

emerge -C amsn

Love,

Today I did a font cleanup and edited the xorg.conf font list and wiped out
everything added from /etc/fonts/local.conf. Also deleted ~/.fonts.cache-1 and
rebooted.  (http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Xorg_and_Fonts)

Also manually deleted all references to amsn on the puter.

I then reinstalled amsn - and for now it seems to work again.

Maybe it was some conflict with the fonts and something hanging around from the
xfree86 era, before the transition to xorg.conf a year ago or so.
