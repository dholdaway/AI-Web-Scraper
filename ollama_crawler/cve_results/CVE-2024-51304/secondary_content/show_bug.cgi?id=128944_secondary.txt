Description

The attached patch is needed to keyword latest libsdl ~x86-fbsd.
The block on all the libusb versions on portage is needed because of bug #128937; to install libsdl on Gentoo/FreeBSD one has either to not have libusb at all or have the version coming from Gentoo/Alt overlay.

The elibtoolize is needed to have libraries named in a decent way (linux type) rather than the single-component soversion as FreeBSD uses usually (avoids breaking linking every micro bump).

Thanks,
Diego

The libusb block is actually needed to have working sdl on G/FBSD.
With libusb 0.1.11 the ./configure fails to identify the joystick driver, don't compile any, and the library has undefined references.
