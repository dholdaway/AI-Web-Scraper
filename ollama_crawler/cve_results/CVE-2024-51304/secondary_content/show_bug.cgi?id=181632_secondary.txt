Description

          2007-06-11 08:01:58 UTC
        

Compilation fails if the seamonkey USE-flag is not disabled.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. USE="seamonkey" emerge totem  (On amd64)
2. Fails to compile..
3. USE="-seamonkey" emerge totem
4. Compiles and works just fine!



Disable the seamonkey flag for amd64

Reopen with compile errors and emerge --info, we need to fix the real bug instead of removing flags. :)

Tried to reproduce the failure by enabling the seamonkey flag and compile again, but this time it worked. I did update a few gnome libraries in between. Sorry for the noice. Close it as invalid. 
Thanks!
