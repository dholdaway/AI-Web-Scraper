Emerging ffmpeg without the network useflag but with the rtmp useflag is possible.

This is not possible for libav.

What problem are you trying to solve here?

Not much of a problem, I just had some issues when I emerged ffmpeg without network but with rtmp. It did not exactly make rtmp work until I reemerged with network. 

Unless it is supposed to be possible to emerge ffmpeg as "-network rtmp" but not libav, would it be possible to add network as a require use flag for rtmp for ffmpeg?

That is what was proposed in the irc channel.

well, in ffmpeg, network useflag controls the internal network protocols; 'rtmp' useflag is for librtmp (media-video/rtmpdump), and is thus independent; I don't see why we should annoy users with REQUIRED_USE when it's ok (but weird) to build ffmpeg with USE="-network rtmp"
