The output of the emerge command contains dark blue text on black background. This is unreadable with the naked eye.

See the attached screenshot.

I believe is not really a bug.

1. If you're on anything other than a plain ol' VT, the color returned by \e[34m is usually controlled by your terminal, and many terminals give options to adjust the exact shade.

2. Screens are very different. For instance, your image is quite readable by me. ( Eyesight can be a factor too ).

3. If neither of the above are satisfactory solutions, you can override it in /etc/portage/color.map  ( man color.map ), so that it displays in a colour of your choosing =).

Hope that helps  =).

Terminals control what colours are used, not sys-apps/portage, except in color.map and in `--color n'.

In rxvt-unicode, this seems to be controlled by URxvt.color4. But the value of this setting is used to control both foreground and background colors.

In systems where color4 is unreadable as a foreground color on a black background, setting it to something brighter will make the corresponding background color too bright. And some programs will also use this as a background color (for example, irssi's default theme). I have not found a way to set the background color separately.

I have noticed that this also changes with the graphics adapter and the display, but on some systems, this is still unreadable.

Having to change programs so that they avoid this color seems a bit hackish, if you say this color should be okay to use as a foreground color, then perhaps there is a bug in rxvt-unicode?

The color problem seems to be reproducible (blue being unreadable) in other terminal emulators on the same machine, including linux's tty, which suggests that this may be related to the GPU or the GPU driver or its settings.
