Description

When emerging a package using the games eclass, the following elog messages are displayed:

 * Remember, in order to play games, you have to
 * be in the 'games' group.
 * Just run 'gpasswd -a <USER> games', then have <USER> re-login.

Such messages should only be displayed when the package is a new install.
These situations can be checked in the eclass as follows:

if ! has_version "${PN}"; then

See the tracker bug 440214 for more details.


Reproducible: Always

If you don't want to see it, set GAMES_SHOW_WARNING=no

The fact that the package is already installed doesn't mean the person doing the current install saw it before.

For lack of a better status... WORKSFORME.

I discovered that variable time ago while reading eclass... why not suggest that setting in the shown message itself? That way people will use it once they add their users to proper group
