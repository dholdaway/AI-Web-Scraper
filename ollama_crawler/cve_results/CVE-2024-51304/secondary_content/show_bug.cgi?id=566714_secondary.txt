logfile indicating missing dutch.ldf

texlive-langdutch builds fine, but on using it, babel complains about missing file dutch.ldf

other texlive-langXXX run fine.

shortest example, filename test.tex:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[dutch]{babel}
\begin{document}
\end{document}

for logfile: see attachment

yes, you should use texlive-langeuropean with recent texlive versions, which provides dutch.ldf, as LINGUAS=nl will pull with app-text/texlive
