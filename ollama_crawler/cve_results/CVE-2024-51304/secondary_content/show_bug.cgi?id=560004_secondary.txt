Description

For a few weeks, when I attempt to push my Git Portage repository changes to the Gentoo overlay, I receive warnings about a server time out. The changes do appear to post when reviewing https://cgit.gentoo.org/user/vmacs.git/, so it's not a critical issue but the warning indicates a "fatal" situation, so it can lead users to thinking that the changes are not successfully posted.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make changes to git repository for Portage Overlay
2. git add *
3. git commit *
4*. git push overlays-gentoo-org master
5. Enter password.

*I set it up with overlays-gentoo-org because origin is used by GitHub. 
Actual Results:  
vallen@localhost /usr/local/portage/dev-db/phpmyadmin $ git push overlays-gentoo-org master
Enter passphrase for key '/home/vallen/.ssh/id_rsa':
git push origin mast----------
WARNING: previous mirror push to host 'ituri.gentoo.org' failed, status is:

   193b3e2..b455be5  master -> master


Expected Results:  
Everything between the ------- marks in the "Actual Results" being gone.

I've checked Google and found another user who had this problem and were told that the message didn't mean anything to anyone except developers. I could not find an open bug on the issue, though, and it would seem that if it's only useful to developers, it should be hidden to those that don't need it. Particularly, as mentioned, because the warning states it's "fatal".

Thanks for your time. If you need further information, please feel free to notify me.

You can ignore all mirror-failed warnings. There are multiple of them, this one is currently not available.

Is there a way that I can suppress messages that I can ignore? I'd rather not be seeing "fatal" warnings on something that actually is successful. Thanks.
