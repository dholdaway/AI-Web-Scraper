Created attachment 489882 [details]
emerge info

Did periodic emerge world and my system was upgraded to plasma-meta 5.10.4 (including konsole 17.04.3).  Everything in plasma seems to be working correctly w/o problems.  However, konsole now hangs momentarily (~ 15-20 secs) at random intervals.  The mouse disappears, but just over konsole window.  I can use all other running applications and even launch new ones w/o issue (even another instance of konsole).

Does konsole have high CPU usage at this time?

No nearly nothing. In fact, I am able, while konsole is hung, to open another instance of konsole and run top. I am even able to run strace in another window, but nothing shows, because most time I am just typing when it hangs. I can NOT use the hung instance of konsole to launch another tab or window. I must run the 2nd konsole from the menu. In fact, while its hung the mouse disappears if moved over top of its window.

Note: If I close my eyes and keep typing the command and any parameters, when konsole finally frees up it will all appear.

This random delay is now propagating to other applications, showing up especially where disk access is involved.  I am beginning to suspect that this is a hardware issue and not a problem with konsole.

Do you notice high disk I/O during that time? Could you already establish it being a hardware issue or alternatively, maybe caused by baloo?

No high disk IO, I used iotop during which my konsole session was hung.  nothing really just 3 or 4 kworker threads

Update:
I just did an emerge -DNu world.  It updated kde-plasma/plasma-meta-5.10.4 to 5.10.5.  (including konsole)  The delay is gone, everything is working properly.  The problem is gone.

konsole is not part of KDE Plasma. But anyway, glad the phenomenon is gone from your system.

OK, next time I will endeavour to report less detail when something occurs
