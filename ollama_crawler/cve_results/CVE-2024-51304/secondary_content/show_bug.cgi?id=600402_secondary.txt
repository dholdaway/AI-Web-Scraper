I have the masked version 1.19 of xorg-drivers and xorg-server installed. When I do emerge -c, portage tries to remove x11-drivers/xf86-video-intel-2.99.917_p20161110, which I clearly want to keep. In my make.conf, I have VIDEO_CARDS="intel i965".
If I try to do emerge -c --exclude xf86-video-intel, it complains with this error message:

 * Dependencies could not be completely resolved due to
 * the following required packages not being installed:
 * 
 *   x11-base/xorg-server:0/1.18.4= pulled in by:
 *     x11-drivers/xf86-video-intel-2.99.917_p20161110
 * 
 * Have you forgotten to do a complete update prior to depclean?
etc.

What do I do? Downgrade? Wait? mask something?

If your hardware is i965 or later, the "modesetting" driver included in xorg-server will replace xf86-video-intel.  Make sure you don't have any xorg configs that force "intel" driver, just let it autoconfig.

If this doesn't work please re-open the bug report, but it should work.  This removal is intended behavior.
