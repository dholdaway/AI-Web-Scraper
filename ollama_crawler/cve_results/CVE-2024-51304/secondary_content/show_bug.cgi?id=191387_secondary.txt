I added x11 to Overlay dir with "layman -a x11" and added xf86-video-intel to /etc/portage/package.keywords file.

emerge runs fine until the following error:

configure: error: Must have X server >= 1.3 source tree for mode setting code. Please specify --with-xserver-source



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.emerge xf86-video-intel

Actual Results:  
configure: error: Must have X server >= 1.3 source tree for mode setting code. Please specify --with-xserver-source


Expected Results:  
successful emerge
