Description

I am trying to emerge specific version of pecl-imagick, and so I tried to run:
emerge =pecl-imagick-3.1.0_r1
With this result:
!!! '=pecl-imagick-3.1.0_r1' is not a valid package atom.
!!! Please check ebuild(5) for full details.

It seems that having "-" in package name makes portage not recognize the version I want correcly.

Tested in portage 2.2_alpha100 and I guess this is valid for every package that has "-" in its name.

Expected result:
Emerge processing this concrete version of pecl-imagick

You passed the wrong version, it should be

# emerge =pecl-imagick-3.1.0_rc1

instead of 3.1.0_r1
