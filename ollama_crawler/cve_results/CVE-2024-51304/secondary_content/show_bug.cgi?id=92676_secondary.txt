Description

First of all, I realize this baselayout is ~x86, I installed it to get unicode support as explained in the unicode guide on gentoo.org.

So I have the same version of the package on my desktop and laptop. No problems on the desktop. But on the laptop I have net.eth0 and sshd in the default runlevel and I can't get the network up at boot time. It looks like dhcpcd just fails but there's no error message, nothing in the logs. I have it set to timeout after 5s otherwise the boot will stall for a long time.

Now here's the kicker.. when I do /etc/init.d/net.eth0 restart AFTER the boot is finished and I'm logged in, it works fine. So as an ugly workaround I added a command to restart the network in /etc/inittab and it works.

Why did I post this as a baselayout bug? Because it was working fine and dandy before I upgraded baselayout :)

I also diff'ed both /etc/init.d/net.eth0 and /etc/conf.d/net from both the desktop and laptop - no difference.

verify 1.11.11-r3 is broken too and re-open if it is

Yeah, seems to be the same.

Is eth0 wired or wireless? Is the driver an external module or compiled into the kernel? If the former, how is the driver being loaded?

eth0 is wired, eth1 is wireless (ipw2100) but I'm not using eth1 so I can't say if it works properly or not

The driver is compiled into the kernel.
eth0: RTL-8139C+ at 0xe0806000, 00:02:3f:68:48:33, IRQ 10
2.6.11-gentoo-r8

Come to think of it, the driver is marked as EXPERIMENTAL in make menuconfig, I'll try the other driver for my adapter to see if there's any difference between them.

AFTER TESTING:
eth0: RealTek RTL8139 at 0xe0806000, 00:02:3f:68:48:33, IRQ 10

It seems that the problem went away, I now get an ip right away. I don't know if that means there's nothing wrong with baselayout but at least my problem is gone.

Marking as "WORKS FOR ME"
Re-open if needed
