 Exhibit 99.1Envista Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 EarningsBrea, California, February 7, 2024 – Envista Holdings Corporation (NYSE: NVST) today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, reported sales were $645.6 million.  Core sales in the quarter declined 2.0% over the corresponding quarter in 2022.  Net loss in the fourth quarter was $217.4 million or $1.27 per diluted share.  The net loss included a $258.3 million non-cash charge related to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. During the same period, adjusted net income was $49.7 million or $0.29 per diluted share compared to adjusted net income of $91.9 million or $0.52 per diluted share in the same period of 2022.  Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $100.5 million compared to $138.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.  Amir Aghdaei, Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Despite a volatile macro backdrop in 2023, the Envista team delivered full year results in line with our expectations. For the full year 2023, we saw a modest decline in core growth and delivered an adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.1%.  Our Orthodontic business continues to outperform, growing double digits for the full year 2023, with Spark Aligner growing over 50%.  We further delivered $223.6 million of free cash flow for the full year, representing an increase of more than $100 million over 2022.” Mr. Aghdaei continued, “We are committed to our purpose of partnering with dental professionals to improve patients’ lives by digitizing, personalizing, and democratizing dental care.  2024 will be a transformational year for Envista as we focus on improving Spark profitability, accelerating our North American implant business, and optimizing our operating structure using the Envista Business System. Long-term, we remain focused on delivering value for patients, our customers, our employees, and our shareholders.”        2024 Guidance For the full year 2024, we expect core sales to grow low-single digits and to deliver adjusted EBITDA margins of between 16% - 17%. We further anticipate that our margins will accelerate as we move through 2024. Our guidance takes into consideration both our investments for the long-term and the continued uncertainty in the macro environment.Please note, we do not provide forward-looking estimates on a GAAP basis as certain information is not available and cannot be reasonably estimated.
