Description

I'm trying to log into an Access point with WPA-Personal 1.0, using a Broadcom BCM4306 card ndiswrapper and wpa_supplicant.  I haven't had a problem with this setup in the past - in fact, it works beautifully - but now, it looks as though ndiswrapper is refusing to associate with the AP.

Here's the output when I execute: wpa_supplicant -Dndiswrapper -iwlan0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
...
Trying to associat with [access point MAC addy]
Association request to the driver failed.
Authentication with 00:00:00:00:00:00 timed out.
...  Thanks

This repeats until I Ctrl-C the command and kill it.  Ndiswrapper didn't complain about anything during the install, and correctly identifies the driver and hardware in dmesg (there are no errors there either).

All /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf contains is these 4 lines:

network={
    ssid="[ssid name]"
    psk="[psk]"
}

I am using the testing portage tree.  I will probably downgrade to stable for the time being...

I have the same exact problem with this bcmwl5 device:

02:06.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4306 802.11b/g Wireless LAN Controller (rev 03)

I'm using it right now to post this message with ndiswrapper-1.15 + linux-2.6.16 both compiled with gcc-3.3.6 . The problem happens if I try to upgrade to ndiswrapper-1.16 which needs to be compiled with at least gcc-3.4.

So I tried compiling linux-2.6.16 and ndiswrapper-1.16 with gcc-3.4 and gcc-4.1.1 and in both cases wpa_supplicant just hangs when it tries to connect to open or WPA protected AP's.

I posted this message here also:

http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=870

Good to see that I'm not the only one with this problem.

-Dndiswrapper is deprecated in 1.16, try -Dwext

that fixed the problem with gcc-4.1.1 and ndiswrapper-1.16 . You can close this bug, it should work for you too.

Yup, that fixes it here too.  Thanks for the heads up!  I'll go ahead and mark it resolved.
