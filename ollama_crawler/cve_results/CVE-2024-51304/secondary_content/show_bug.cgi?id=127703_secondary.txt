running emerge -NuD world with package.use ~x86 for mythtv results in mythtv being upgraded to 0.19.  subsequent emerge downgrades to 0.18, and so on, in an infinite loop.

i think the problem might be that /usr/bin/mtd is dependent on the 0.18 libs (that's what causes a downgrade running revdep-rebuild).

Reopen with 'equery b /usr/bin/mtd', really can't be bothered to ponder what provides this binary.

[ Searching for file(s) /usr/bin/mtd in *... ]
media-plugins/mythdvd-0.18.1 (/usr/bin/mtd)

hmm, is upgrading the main myth package supposed to force an upgrade of installed plugins?

When using hardmasked packages, care to unmask all of them that are needed, not just one. Alternatively, don't use package.masked ebuilds at all and save yourself the trouble.
