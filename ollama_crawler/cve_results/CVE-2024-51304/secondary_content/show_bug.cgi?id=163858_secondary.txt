If my network eth0 is set to get IP automatically and no network cable/link is present dhcp still tries to get IP. This results in very slow boot up when no network cable/link is present.

I suggest that there should be a check if any network cable/link is present before dhcp tries to get IP. So if there's a cable/link up then it will try to get IP from dhcp servers otherwise it should just skip searching for IP.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Change settings in  /etc/conf.d/net  to config_eth0=("dhcp")
2. Unplug networking cables, disable wifi
3. reboot

Actual Results:  
very slow boot time due to searching for dhcp servers to get IP

Expected Results:  
to check if any cables/links present and then search for dhcp servers

sys-apps/ifplugd
sys-apps/netplug

(And if you don't want either of those, you still can set a short timeout in your configuration file)
