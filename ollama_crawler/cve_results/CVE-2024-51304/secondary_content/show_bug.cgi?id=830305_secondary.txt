Anything else to add? kitty already depends on media-libs/lcms and all in-tree versions of it should provide that library unless something went wrong when building it.

At least output of these would be useful:
emerge --info media-libs/lcms
qlist -e media-libs/lcms

Maybe it is nothing but I thought reporting such a QA Notice could be important.

For this kind of QA notice it can be, given it often means a missing a dependency and broken runtime -- but in this case the library seems to be on your system according to the qlist so imagine there's some oddity going on rather than a real issue.

Are you still getting the QA notice if you emerge kitty again? (maybe try to emerge -1 media-libs/lcms first too). If so, maybe be good to see this too:

lddtree /usr/lib64/kitty/kitty/fast_data_types.so

If not, then I guess everything's fine.

the output of lddtree /usr/lib64/kitty/kitty/fast_data_types.so is:

Well, don't know why you got a QA notice but everything looks normal.
