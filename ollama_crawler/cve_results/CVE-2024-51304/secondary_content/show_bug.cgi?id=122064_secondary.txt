When watching a DVD (and occasionally some .avi files) in fullscreen with totem, the controls stay on the screen indefinitely after the mouse has been moved. Totem appears to try to clear them from the screen as the progress slider and timer don't update, yet they still remain on screen.

Totem has been compiled using the xine-lib (1.1.1-r3) backend and is using the following USE flags: 

[ebuild   R   ] media-video/totem-1.2.1  -a52 -debug +dvd +flac +gnome -lirc +mad +mpeg -nsplugin +ogg -theora +vorbis (-win32codecs) +xine +xv 0 kB

I also ran into the same problem; but without xine backend installed.

[ebuild   R   ] media-video/totem-1.2.1  USE="a52 dvd flac gnome mad mpeg nsplugin ogg theora vorbis xv -debug -lirc -xine" 0 kB

Though after playing around; I believe it is more serious.  On my system (also amd64), after force closing totem; and restarting  Totem will die every time I try to play a dvd without any error messages on the screen; but checking my messages log; I get find out it is seg faulting.  I doubt be much help but here's the seg faults I am recieving (system not setup for debugging atm).

Can't reproduce this with gstreamer backend, might be xine lib and/or amd64 specific.

This is upstream gnome bug 314805, it seems that black areas of the screen (i.e where video is not displayed) do not get refreshed when the osd is supposed to vanish. If the video is the same aspect as the screen (i.e there are no black areas) the problem does not occur. The upstream bug has reports of this on x86 systems so I assume it's not amd64 specific.

This bug is xine specific, backend we decided to drop from Totem (as did upstream too)

Newer versions of totem do not have this bug, bug can be closed.

Thanks
