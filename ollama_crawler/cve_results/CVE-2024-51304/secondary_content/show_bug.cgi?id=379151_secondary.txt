Description

http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/infrastructure/cvs-sshkeys.xml

When I filled my ebuild qiuz 1.5 years ago I had RSA key,
but got([1]) an impression DSA was the only available format so created
second key.

May I ask someone from crypto herd help to add some text about
DSA, RSA (and ECDSA?) and which one should Average Dev pick?

Thanks!

Oh, and this one states on DSA explicitely:

> http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/recruiters/mentor.xml

> Along with the quiz, an OpenSSH SSH2 DSA public key for infrastructure access should be provided to recruiters.

Hello Sergei,

Bit late...

But now ecdsa is the preferred method as far as I know, it uses much shorter keys with same strength...

Some reading is available at[1].

Doc will be updated when other keys are officially supported.
