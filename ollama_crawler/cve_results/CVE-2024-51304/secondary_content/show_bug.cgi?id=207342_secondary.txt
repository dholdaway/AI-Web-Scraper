rpm-4.5.0.4.ebuild

This ebuild is works, but not perfect. 1) rpm5.org only provides src.rpm files for 4.5; tarball is inside the src.rpm files. 2) It looks like magic files are not being copied: cp: cannot stat `/var/tmp/portage/app-arch/rpm-4.5.0.4/work/4.5.0.4/file/magic/magic.mime.mgc': No such file or directory
cp: cannot stat `/var/tmp/portage/app-arch/rpm-4.5.0.4/work/4.5.0.4/file/magic/magic.mgc': No such file or directory
cp: cannot stat `/var/tmp/portage/app-arch/rpm-4.5.0.4/work/4.5.0.4/file/magic/magic.mime': No such file or directory
cp: cannot stat `/var/tmp/portage/app-arch/rpm-4.5.0.4/work/4.5.0.4/file/magic/magic': No such file or directory
