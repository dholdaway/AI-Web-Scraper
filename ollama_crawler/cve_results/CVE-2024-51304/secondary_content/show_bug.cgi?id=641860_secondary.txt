Bump QT5 to version 5.9.x stable LTS ( right now 5.9.3 )

Qt-5.9.3 is in tree already, but stabilisation will happen at a later point.

@Andreas Yes, I have seen that. 

Any specific cause/reason it is not yet considered stable?




Comment 3

Well first of all, it hasn't been 30 days, and then 5.9.3 added breaking changes that still require medium to big regressions in rdeps to be fixed. On top of already known regressions with 5.9.




Comment 4


Stefan Cristian Brindusa





          2017-12-21 23:20:16 UTC
        

Alright. Are the regressions somewhere publicly available ( logs, portage, toolchain, etc. ) ?

Well, you *are* already on bugs.gentoo.org, right? ;) Some bugs are known, some are yet to be discovered.




Comment 6


Andreas Sturmlechner






          2017-12-22 10:18:19 UTC
        

The root cause is the inclusion of http://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtbase.git/commit/?id=f62768d046528636789f901ac79e2cfa1843a7b7 in Qt-5.9.3, and KDE devs expect this to break the code in many more instances than have been patched so far.

We haven't even decided on a target branch to stabilise yet. In the past, our 5.x stabilisation targets have been mostly driven by what revdeps require.




Comment 8


Michael Palimaka (kensington)






          2018-01-01 00:09:02 UTC
        

We're tracking the next stabilisation candidate in bug #642822.
