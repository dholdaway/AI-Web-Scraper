sys-apps/util-linux-2.32-r4 is a stable package, and emerge doesn't just naturally skip upgrade of util-linux.

How can I make emerge naturally skip upgrades to package versions that are blocked?

As said on https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/net-wireless/rfkill “>=sys-apps/util-linux-2.31_rc1 also provides rfkill”, so you have to unmerge rfkill before emerging an util-linux newer than that.

What should be done about this issue?

To solve this issue:

1. emerge --unmerge rfkill
2. emerge --ask --oneshot util-linux

You will not lose /usr/sbin/rfkill by doing this; the new util-linux version provides a new version.

Sophie is correct. Follow that two step plan please.
