Description

I'm building gnome on a Sony Vaio N505SN (Mobile Pentium II, cpu family 6, 
model 6). gcc: (GCC) 3.3.6 (Gentoo 3.3.6, ssp-3.3.6-1.0, pie-8.7.8), and my 
make.conf looks like that: 
CFLAGS="-O2 -march=pentium2"
CHOST="i686-pc-linux-gnu"
CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"
USE="acpi directfb fb fbcon cdrom pcmcia emacs exif joystick mmx php usb 
mysql -kde -pam -gnome -cups -spell -nls -alsa -gpm 
-python -opengl -quicktime"
MAKEOPTS="-j2"
AUTOCLEAN="yes"

during the build I get:
Making all in stock-icons
make[4]: Entering directory `/var/tmp/portage/gtk+-2.6.10-r1/work/gtk+-
2.6.10/gtk/stock-icons'
[...]
/bin/sh: line 1: 30682 Illegal instruction     
GDK_PIXBUF_MODULE_FILE=../../gdk-pixbuf/gdk-pixbuf.loaders ../../gdk-pixbuf/
[...]
make[4]: *** [gtkstockpixbufs.h] Error 1

The same problem appears with different versions of gtk, and the previous 
version of gcc

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.emerge gtk+
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Build of gtk+ fails

Expected Results:  
gtk+ emerged

I was able to build gtk+ successfully in a VMware virtual machine on the same 
hardware, with "march=i686" in my make.conf.
For me the bug is no longer important and probably solved with the different 
march settings

Another work around would be the usage of a binary package...

best regards
