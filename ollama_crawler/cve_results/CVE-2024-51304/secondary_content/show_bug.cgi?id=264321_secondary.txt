you're fast... here is the output of the latest command (I'm also attaching it):
sylvain@markov ~ $ emerge -pv bison flex

These are the packages that would be merged, in order:

Calculating dependencies... done!

Could I get you to do:
emerge -1 bison; emerge -1 flex; emerge -1 =gcc-4.3.3-r2
and see if it still fails?
Looks like some kind of bison problem to me.

it compiles fine now, thanks a lot. That was fast... I wonder why bison was broken: I made an upgrade and deplean a few days ago (emerge -avuND world && emerge --depclean && revdep-rebuild) but no problem showed up...

thanks again
