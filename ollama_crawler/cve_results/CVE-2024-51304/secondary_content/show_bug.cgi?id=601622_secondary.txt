Created attachment 455118 [details]
Copied from the mentioned website.

New install on Powermac 7,2 using

eselect profile set 10

(default/linux/powerpc/ppc64/13.0/32bit-userland/desktop/gnome)

From the build log:

.....

!!! Couldn't download 'debianutils_4.7.tar.xz'. Aborting.
 * Fetch failed for 'sys-apps/debianutils-4.7....

...

From the look of one of the source sites Debian has moved to 4.8.1 and no longer has version 4.7 available. See attachment from

http://ftp.nl.debian.org/debian/pool/main/d/debianutils/

The file is available on gentoo mirrors. Do you have GENTOO_MIRRORS set to some bad value?

The only thing I knowingly did with regard to GENTOO_MIRRORS was run the mirrorselect command as suggested in the PPC handbook. This resulted in the following line being added to /mnt/gentoo/etc/portage/config/make.conf:

GENTOO_MIRRORS="http://mirror.usu.edu/mirrors/gentoo/"

Is this a bad mirror and should I try a different one?

Thanks

This bug can be closed.  I reran mirrorselect and picked 3 different mirrors and had no further trouble downloading the correct source.

Still it seems to me that there might be a problem with the original mirror I selected.

Thank you.
