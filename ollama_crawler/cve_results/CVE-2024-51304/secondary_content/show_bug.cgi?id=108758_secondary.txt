I was trying to update apache2 with net-www/apache2-0.54-r31 and it failed
because there was a robots.txt was missing. I also tried with apache2-0.54-r15
and it also failed.

.. (the wget downloads) ...

!!! Files listed in the manifest do not exist!
files/robots.txt 

I was told that it can be solved like this:
# FEATURES="-strict" emerge apache

My arch is SPARC.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
2.
3.

Works fine here, change your mirror and reopen if it still fails...
