Hi,

this is an enhancement for net-misc/dhcpcd's live ebuild, to create a changelog from git's commit messages:

--- dhcpcd-9999.ebuild.old	2013-08-26 23:02:37.000000000 +0200
+++ dhcpcd-9999.ebuild	2013-08-26 23:05:13.000000000 +0200
@@ -29,6 +29,14 @@
 
 src_prepare()
 {
+	if [[ ${PV} == 9999* ]] ; then
+		einfo "Producing ChangeLog from Git history ..."
+		pushd "${S}/.git" >/dev/null || die "Unable to chdir into ${S}/.git"
+		git log > "${S}"/ChangeLog || die "Unable to get logs from git"
+		popd >/dev/null || die "Unable chdir back to previous directory"
+	fi
+	
+	
 	epatch_user
 }



Reproducible: Always

Due to the new git eclasses now using shallow clones, I don't think this
patch would still work. Please re-open if you find another way to do so,
and I'll re-consider doing this.

Thanks,

William
