I'm requesting something similar to this -- 

https://wiki.debian.org/PepperFlashPlayer

So it'll download chrome, extract the plugin and put it in the standard place.

This is intended for use with www-plugins/freshplayerplugin

Isn't this available with www-plugins/chrome-binary-plugins?

Maybe it should've had a better name.

Anyway, thanks for that!
