When using qt4-r2 eclass in combination with multibuild.eclass there is a problem with _find_project_file(), bacuase it runs allways in ${S} instead of ${BUILD_DIR}. Is it possible to change the default path to run in to pwd?

I just saw it is not always a problem, but perhaps we should loosen it anyways.

Forget this statement, eqmake4 will always use the original pro file and not the altered one in the variant BUILD_DIS.

uh? _find_project_file() does:

  local pro_files=(*.pro)

so no, it does not run always in ${S}.

Maybe you want some BUILD_DIR awareness in qt4-r2_src_configure?

that would be great. At least the possibility to specify a dir. perhaps it should run in ".".

We already do everything relative to $PWD...
