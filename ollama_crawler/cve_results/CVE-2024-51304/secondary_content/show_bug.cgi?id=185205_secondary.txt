The sys-auth/pam_chroot package is the suggested upgrade path for users using pam_chroot USE flag in <sys-libs/pam-0.99. Please take some time to test it and keyword it as needed, considering that with or without it, pam-0.99 is supposed to go stable at the beginning of September 2k7.

This is not arch specific and about gcc-4.2, I've added a patch to fix that.

At this point this works for me, other keywords will be handle as a standard package.
