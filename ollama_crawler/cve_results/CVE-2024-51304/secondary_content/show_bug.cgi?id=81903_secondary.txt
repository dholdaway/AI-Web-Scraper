We I run a mirrorselect it brings back a mirror that returns a forbidden code for an attemtped downloads. I also noted that it doesn't resolve the IP.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.mirrorselect -a -s3 -b10
Actual Results:  
>>> Downloading http://194.117.143.70/distfiles/slocate-2.7-debian.patch.bz2
--20:45:50--  http://194.117.143.70/distfiles/slocate-2.7-debian.patch.bz2
           => `/usr/portage/distfiles/slocate-2.7-debian.patch.bz2'
Connecting to 194.117.143.70:80... connected.
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 403 Forbidden
20:45:51 ERROR 403: Forbidden.

Expected Results:  
The mirrorselect should have noted the download failure?

The system isn't in anyway compromised the download fails and goes on the next
mirror which is successful, more an annoyance than a 'bug'.

I do not see a mirror on our list that pertains to that mirror. Perhaps you could be more specific as to the record in our list that it references.

Thanks,
Jeffrey

Not sure what happened. I got this for only a few days and then it stopped doing it.

I never altered any settings inbetween either. Thanks anyway.. but I think this could be resolved now.
