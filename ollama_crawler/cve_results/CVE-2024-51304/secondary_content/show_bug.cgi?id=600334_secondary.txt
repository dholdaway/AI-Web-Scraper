As other packages seem to depend on parts of docker/distribution, it would be great if docker-registry would install those sources as well.

For many golang packages, I don't think it's very practical to install the sources. They are typically unused, since most packages bundle their dependencies in a vendor directory.

In cases when dependencies are not provided in a vendor directory, I typically make the ebuild pull in the dependencies via SRC_URI, and unpack them in a temporary GOPATH. For example, the docker-swarm-1.2.5 ebuild uses this approach, since the vendor directory doesn't include all of the dependencies.

I know that bundling dependencies may not be an ideal solution, but it's very practical because it aligns with upstream's tendency to vendor dependencies.

Note that docker registry includes a large number of vendored dependencies:

https://github.com/docker/distribution/tree/master/vendor

Will we have to install all those vendor sources in /usr/lib/go-gentoo as well? I don't think it would be very practical.

Okay, that works for me. Thanks!
