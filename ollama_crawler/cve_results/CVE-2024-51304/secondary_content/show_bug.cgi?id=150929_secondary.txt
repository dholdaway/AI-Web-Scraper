The init script fails to wait for the massacre of the child processes started by the multiplexor. This was allowed for in the generic linux init script but conditional on the "wait" option being passed. A revised init script and configuration file can be made available.

I'm not really keen on pondering what you mean. Kindly reopen with ebuild name and version, thanks.

I would reopen with ebuild name and version if I knew how. I'm a newbie when it come to Buzilla. Sorry!

I'm a newbie to bugzilla and don't know where to place the package name etc. (I promise to RTFM ASAP). The ebuild I'm trying to help fix is MIMEDefang.
