When attempting to emerge either dev-python/mantissa-0.4.1 or dev-python/mantissa-0.3.1, the install fails and complains:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "setup.py", line 3, in ?
    from xmantissa import version
  File "/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/PIL/__init__.py", line 3, in ?
    # $Id: __init__.py 2134 2004-10-06 08:55:20Z fredrik $
ImportError: No module named versions



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add dev-python/mantissa to /etc/portage/package.keywords
2. emerge dev-python/mantissa

Actual Results:  
 *
 * ERROR: dev-python/mantissa-0.4.1 failed.
 * Call stack:
 *          ebuild.sh, line 1695:  Called dyn_install
 *          ebuild.sh, line 1132:  Called qa_call 'src_install'
 *          ebuild.sh, line   44:  Called src_install
 *          ebuild.sh, line 1377:  Called distutils_src_install
 *   distutils.eclass, line   61:  Called die
 * The specific snippet of code:
 *              ${python} setup.py install --root=${D} --no-compile "$@" || die
 *  The die message:
 *   (no error message)
 *
 * If you need support, post the topmost build error, and the call stack if relevant.
 * A complete build log is located at '/var/tmp/portage/dev-python/mantissa-0.4.1/temp/build.log'.
 *


Expected Results:  
A successful emerge / installation of dev-python/mantissa.

There is no "version" module under xmantissa from the svn.
The __init__.py file under xmantissa is:

"# -*- test-case-name: xmantissa.test -*-

from epsilon.versions import Version

version = Version(__name__, 0, 1, 0)"

Maybe this is the correction that is needed?

The only version in the tree is 0.6.1 right now and the installation works
fine. Please reopen if the problem is still not fixed.
