Hi all,

I merged nwn-1.66, can start it via "nwn" fine. 
But after setting video options (like resolution) and leaving/restarting
the game, those options are set to default values again. And there is
no ~/.nwn directory at all.

Any ideas how this could be?
I am sure this user has the rights to store stettings in this directory...

Greetings and TIA, Matthias

Update: I resolved this issue by chuser'ing -R /opt/nwn for my user.
Should this be necessary after a normal "emerge nwn"?

I do. (Just got it recently)

I've also been playing it.

NWN works fine if you follow the instructions in the ebuild and run
/opt/nwn/fixinstall after the package is merged.

It looks like something went wrong with your installation.  Try to reinstall (if
you're doing that, follow my directions in bug #106789 instead).

Also, be sure to emerge sync first, as I did make one change that would probably
affect this.
