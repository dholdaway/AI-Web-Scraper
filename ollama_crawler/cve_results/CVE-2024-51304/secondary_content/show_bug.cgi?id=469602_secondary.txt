emerge --info

After emerge -u world updates to KDE-4.10.2 sound stopped working for all users (up until then, sound worked perfectly).  Nothing the user does will get sound to work. Once root logs in thru KDE, sound begins to work, not only for root, but for all users

Please check your user alsa and phonon settings (systemsettings).
