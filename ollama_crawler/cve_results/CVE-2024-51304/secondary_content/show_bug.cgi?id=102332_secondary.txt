fglrx64_6_8_0-8.14.13-1.x86_64.rpm
Downloaded from mirror:
ftp://mirror.pacific.net.au/linux/Gentoo/distfiles/fglrx64_6_8_0-8.14.13-1.x86_64.rpm

to fix:
cd /usr/portage/distfiles
wget http://www2.ati.com/drivers/linux/64bit/fglrx64_6_8_0-8.14.13-1.x86_64.rpm

version on ati's website passes md5, I'm not sure if all mirrors are corrupt, or
just planetmirror.net.au

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. rm /usr/portage/distfiles/fglrx64_6_8_0-8.14.13-1.x86_64.rpm
2. set GENTOO_MIRRORS="ftp://mirror.pacific.net.au/linux/Gentoo"
3. emerge ati-drivers
4. wait while fglrx64_6_8_0-8.14.13-1.x86_64.rpm
Actual Results:  
!!! Digest verification Failed:
!!!    /usr/portage/distfiles/fglrx64_6_8_0-8.14.13-1.x86_64.rpm
!!! Reason: Failed on MD5 verification

Expected Results:  
MD5 correct
package continues installation

i just tried this myself and it looks fine. sometimes there are race conditions
where the first download of a file gets cut off, but it picks up on the next sync.
