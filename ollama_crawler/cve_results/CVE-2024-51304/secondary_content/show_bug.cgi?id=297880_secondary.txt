Uh...  yeah...  not a good idea to name to programs the same thing.
'www-client/chromium' has a file collision in user's home directory when attempting to install while the videogame 'games-action/chromium' is already installed.

It took hours to compile www-client/chromium on my system, only to fail because of a stupid file collision.  I was so mad, I just shut the system down without noting the file name.  So, to reproduce, just install games-action/chromium followed by www-client/chromium.

Personally, I'd rather keep the videogame ;)

Sorry for asking you to compile it second time, but I just tried emerging chromium-4.0.249.43 with games-action/chromium installed and didn't experience any problems. Could you post the exact error you're getting?

If you want to try saving some time, please try chromium-bin first.

 * If a collision occurs and you can not explain where the file came from

Thanks for checking this!

Please update your games-action/chromium package. Version 0.9.13.3 is no longer in the tree, and the current version 0.9.14 doesn't have this problem.

For reference, some listings from my system:

$ equery files games-action/chromium | grep desktop
/usr/share/applications/chromium-bsu-chromium.desktop
$ equery files www-client/chromium | grep desktop
/usr/share/applications/chromium-chromium.desktop
$ equery files www-client/chromium-bin | grep desktop
/usr/share/applications/chromium-bin-chromium-bin.desktop
