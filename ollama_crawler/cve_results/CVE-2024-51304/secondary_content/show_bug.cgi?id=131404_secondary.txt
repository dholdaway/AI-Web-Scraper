Hi!

When I use ivman, dbus and hald I allways get errormessages whenever attaching a device. 

When installing I have followd the instruction in the kde installation guide.

The problem vanished when I made 
#chown ivman:plugdev /media 
which allows the ivman to create directories as needed. 


I think this information should med included in the kde-installation handbook. This matter have hounted me since I first use ivman some year ago and I solved now. I cxonsider this as an "bug" in the handbook. 

I gues this cannot be fixed in the stage-tar since the user and group is nonexistent in that point of time. 

Regards
// Erik

Without specific error messages, we have no way of knowing if you have just misconfigured something in your system or if it is an actual bug. Your workaround seems rather hackish; by default that should not be necessary with ivman. It could also be a problem with pmount. Can you reproduce the error and post the output?

We might need to CC genstef (ivman's maintainer) or cardoe (pmount maintainer) on this. I'll check around on IRC first, though.

Besides, there's no mention of any /media directory in any of our docs.

That's the point! My opinion it SHOULD be mentioned in the instructions. (In reply to comment #2)

That's my point. I think it SHOULD be mentioned.

/media should be created by portage on updating gnome to 2.14 or dbus/hald won't work properly (see also http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-458267.html, last post).

I just bought a USB card reader and connected it.
Strangely enough, /media/EOS_DIGITAL appeared out of thin air and my card was automounted.

Besides,
$ equery b /media/.keep
[ Searching for file(s) /media/.keep in *... ]
sys-apps/pmount-0.9.9 (/media/.keep)
sys-apps/hal-0.5.7-r2 (/media/.keep)

Looks like a /worksforme resolution

Same here. On my system, /dev/hdc (my CDRW) is symlinked to /media/cdrecorder. I use dbus, hal, and pmount and have never ever had to touch any weird settings. Or seen any weird error messages as described by the reporter.

FWIW, I only use gnome-2.12 and xfce 4.2; they both make proper use of /media, though I think /media was really created by gnome a couple of versions ago.

Closing as per neysx's suggestion.
