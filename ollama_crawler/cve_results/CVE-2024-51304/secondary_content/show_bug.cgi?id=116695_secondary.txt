Sandro,  I'm not able to reproduce this here, otherwise I'd at least do an -r1 with the fix.  Since almost all of herdstat has been rewritten since the last release, I'm not going to take the time to try and reproduce it (esp. since the only difference in test output looks to be whitespace).

If anyone else is able to reproduce this then please reopen this bug and I'll disable the tests until the next release.
