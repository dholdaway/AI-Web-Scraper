Description

          2008-03-04 15:43:24 UTC
        

when attempting to emerge dev-python/qscintilla-python, after re-digesting (it has an incorrect digest, filed in another bug) the build, the patch fails to apply, causing the ebuild to fail.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
emerge -1av dev-python/qscintilla-python

Actual Results:  
 * Failed Patch: qscintilla-python-2.1-nostrip.patch !
 *  ( /usr/portage/dev-python/qscintilla-python/files/qscintilla-python-2.1-nostrip.patch )
 *
 * Include in your bugreport the contents of:
 *
 *   /var/tmp/portage/dev-python/qscintilla-python-2.1/temp/qscintilla-python-2.1-nostrip.patch-15107.out

 *
 * ERROR: dev-python/qscintilla-python-2.1 failed.
 * Call stack:
 *               ebuild.sh, line   49:  Called src_unpack
 *             environment, line 2306:  Called epatch 'src_unpack'
 *             environment, line 1222:  Called die
 * The specific snippet of code:
 *                   die "Failed Patch: ${patchname}!";
 *  The die message:
 *   Failed Patch: qscintilla-python-2.1-nostrip.patch!
 *
 * If you need support, post the topmost build error, and the call stack if relevant.
 * A complete build log is located at '/var/log/portage/dev-python:qscintilla-python-2.1:20080304-152556.log'.
 * The ebuild environment file is located at '/var/tmp/portage/dev-python/qscintilla-python-2.1/temp/environment'.


Expected Results:  
patch applied correctly

Must be a local problem, as it works fine here.

>>> Unpacking QScintilla-1.73-gpl-2.1.tar.gz to /var/tmp/portage/portage/dev-python/qscintilla-python-2.1/work
