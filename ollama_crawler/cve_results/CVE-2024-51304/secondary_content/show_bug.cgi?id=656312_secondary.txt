Description

I installed plasma 5.12.5 yesterday, after its stabilization. Now it seems I cannot change the desktop background. It is currently stuck on one the background from one of my activities (uniform color).

The only thing I see in my logs from the moment I try to change the background is

kwin_x11[8664]: QXcbConnection: XCB error: 3 (BadWindow), sequence: 43955, resource id: 37748932, major code: 15 (QueryTree), minor code: 0

This is reproducible. It may be harmless and just related to me opening the window for setting the background, but it is the only clue I have.

I still have this issue, but it does not happen after every login to a Plasma session. What I see in the logs, not entirely correlated with me trying to set the background:

jun 01 08:11:20 <hostname> kwin_x11[11010]: QXcbConnection: XCB error: 3 (BadWindow), sequence: 61470, resource id: 35651742, major code: 15 (QueryTree), minor code: 0
jun 01 08:11:05 <hostname> kwin_x11[11010]: QXcbConnection: XCB error: 9 (BadDrawable), sequence: 58731, resource id: 27287579, major code: 14 (GetGeometry), minor code: 0
jun 01 08:11:05 <hostname> kwin_x11[11010]: QXcbConnection: XCB error: 3 (BadWindow), sequence: 58730, resource id: 27287579, major code: 3 (GetWindowAttributes), minor code: 0

You haven't really described what you do and what happens or what happens not.

Supposedly you use the 'configure desktop' context item, you can then select a new wallpaper in the dialog, but it does not apply?
