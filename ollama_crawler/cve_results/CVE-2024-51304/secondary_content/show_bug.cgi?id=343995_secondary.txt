263           { return __builtin_strlen(__s); }

It should also be noted that this is effecting older versions that use to work, not sure if its a gcc 4.4.4 issue or what.

I don't know why but emerge -e world fixed this.  Maybe one of the gnome or possibly x11 libraries was corrupt or something was broken somewhere.  none of the usual tools like revdep-rebuild or lafilefixer found anything wrong.

The answer is somewhere in here, probably towards the end.

Closing then, according to a user on IRC this was because of missing:
# revdep-rebuild --library libssl.so.0.9.8
# revdep-rebuild --library libcrypto.so.0.9.8

It was in postinst of OpenSSL upgrade.
