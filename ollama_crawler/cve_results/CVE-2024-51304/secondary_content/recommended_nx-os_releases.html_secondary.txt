Recommended Cisco NX-OS Releases for Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches 
  


  Revised Date: January 25, 2024 
 This document lists the recommended Cisco NX-OS software releases for use with Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switches for both new and existing deployments. These recommendations are general: best practice is to complement them by a release notes and bug tool kit review to identify caveats applicable to specifics Hardware and Software features used. The recommendations should not replace environment specific design review efforts nor override Advanced Services recommended releases if employed.




Note Maintenance releases that are not a part of the recommended release trains can become available for download before they are recommended in this document. If a maintenance release later than what is recommended below is available for download, review the “Resolved Caveats” section in the  Cisco Nexus 7000 Series NX-OS Release Notes and determine if any resolved caveats are applicable to your deployment scenario and feature set and upgrade to the later release to benefit from the incremental fixes.




  General Recommendation for New and Existing Deployments  
 Cisco recommends that customers with new and existing Cisco Nexus 7000 Series deployments choose from the following recommended releases:
