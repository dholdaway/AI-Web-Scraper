Description

I emerged rxvt-unicode, and ran vim inside the urxvt terminal.
The backspace key didn't work but printed funny chars instead.
I followed the info in http://www.ibb.net/~anne/keyboard/keyboard.html#terminfo and noticed I didn't have a /etc/terminfo/u/urxvt file. So I duplicated /etc/terminfo/r/rxvt and now it works.

Now, it is a bit odd, as I get:
$ echo $TERM
rxvt

Which should, as far as i understand, make the rxvt be used. But i guess it doesn't.

I thought of adding a symlink from (prefix)/r/rxvt to (prefix)/u/urxvt, and can offer a simple patch for it.
But perhaps there is an actual problem to solve here?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge rxvt-unicode vim
2. enter insert mode, write something and then try to erase it using the backspace key.

Actual Results:  
Notice funny chars entered.

Expected Results:  
chars being erased.

Not reproducible at all...

# equery f rxvt-unicode | grep terminfo
/usr/share/doc/rxvt-unicode-8.2/rxvt-unicode.terminfo.bz2
/usr/share/terminfo
/usr/share/terminfo/r
/usr/share/terminfo/r/rxvt-unicode

$ echo $TERM
rxvt-unicode

[ebuild   R   ] x11-terms/rxvt-unicode-8.2  USE="iso14755 perl truetype" 0 kB

I also get:
$ equery f rxvt-unicode |grep terminfo
/usr/share/doc/rxvt-unicode-8.1/rxvt-unicode.terminfo.bz2
/usr/share/terminfo
/usr/share/terminfo/r
/usr/share/terminfo/r/rxvt-unicode

However:
$ echo $TERM
rxvt

[ebuild   R   ] x11-terms/rxvt-unicode-8.1  USE="iso14755 perl truetype" 0 kB

Well, then set your TERM properly? What's exactly the issue here? :)

You are correct.
I found the cause to this in this line I had in my .Xdefaults file:
urxvt*termName:         rxvt

Thanks!

OK, I guess this can be closed now. ;)
