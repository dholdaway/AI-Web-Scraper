emerge --info

After an update to sys-fs/cryptsetup-2.4.3
revdep-rebuild rebuilds both sys-fs/cryptsetup-2.4.3 sys-libs/libblockdev-2.25 every time i run it.

Running revdep-rebuild.sh doesn't rebuild the packages.

Downgrading to sys-fs/cryptsetup-2.3.6-r2 solved the issue.

Sounds like a bug in revdep-rebuild.

What version of gentoolkit are you using?

Please provide the output of "revdep-rebuild --pretend --debug".

revdep-rebuild -p --debug

Gentoolkit version: app-portage/gentoolkit-0.5.1-r1

I upgraded again to sys-fs/cryptsetup-2.4.3 to attach the output of
revdep-rebuild --pretend --debug

And the issue seems to be gone.
