after that i emerge the rest of the ebuilds and typed in "startx"
but it failed telling me, that it couldn´t find the default font 'fixed'


switching back to old xorg gave me thousands of broken libraries, and dozens of portage errors, i am right now about to repair my system.

Looks like $(UCS2ANY) isn't getting set. Do/did you have font-util installed, and /usr/bin/ucs2any? It should have been pulled in.

I dont know right now, if font-util was installed, and i need the system up and running at the moment, so i will try it again to night. But if i try to emerge font-adobe-100dpi font-util shows not up in the dependency list.
/usr/bin/ucs2any is installed.

I updated to xorg 7 again, and this time i had no trouble with this font, maybe someone changed something.
It works, so i think, we can close this bug now.
