Description

When I'm browsing my local filesystem using the file:// syntax, Firefox loses the final directory when creating hyperlinks in the directory I'm browsing if I leave off the trailing slash in the URL. So, for instance, if I browse to
     file:///home/kurt/dls/games
and have no trailing slash after "games", then all of the links to the files in the directory will leave out "/games" when attempting to link to files. In the URL depicting the problem, it can be seen that the address bar reads merely
     file:///home/kurt/dls/games
but the link to the "emulation" subdirectory in "games" is created as
     file:///home/kurt/dls/emulation

The problem is fixed if I manually add a trailing slash to the end of the URL, although the next directory link I click on won't have the trailing slash generated, so I have to manually enter a trailing slash again.

Compare the following two screenshots, paying attention to the address bar and to the status bar:

This is using Firefox 1.0.2.

Whoops, and previously reported to the Mozilla Bugzilla by me, but they weren't able to reproduce the problem. Here's the relevant bug report:
