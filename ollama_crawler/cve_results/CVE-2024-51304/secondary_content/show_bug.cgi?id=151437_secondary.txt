Hi, jabberd by default outputs debugging messages to the console every 5 minutes, thanks to this line in jsm/modules/mod_stat.c:

register_beat(300, mod_stat_write, (void*)stat_data);

I think that's terribly annoying ;)  It looks like it can be turned off or diverted using jabberd.xml, but it's not clear how. The initscript mystically contains "-Z shutupdebug", which presumably requires a change to jabberd.xml before it has any effect.

My simple fix is to turn off this excessive debug info, by adding this command to the ebuild:

	sed -i \
		-e "s:register_beat:// register_beat:" \
		jsm/modules/mod_stat.c

The ebuild already contains a "debug" USE flag, so perhaps there could be a "5mindebug" USE flag for anyone who wants this feature :)

Also call to js_mapi_register() (or whole void mod_stat()) (line 132 of mod_stat.c) could be commented out. Several ebuilds have already 'stats' (or alike) flag.

I'll probably add 'stats' to IUSE, and if it's not set comment whole content to mod_stat() function in mod_stat.c - that will disable statistics, not only printing it.

Ok, I won't make that ebuild change, as commenting out:

<mod_stat>/usr/lib/libjabberdsm.so</mod_stat>

from:

<load main="jsm">
...
</load>

works as intended.
