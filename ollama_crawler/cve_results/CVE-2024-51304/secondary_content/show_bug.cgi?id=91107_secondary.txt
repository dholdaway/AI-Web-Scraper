The entry for portage-2.0.51.21.tar.bz2 in the digest file is:
MD5 6309551a32a71b621d880327e1318a09 portage-2.0.51.21.tar.bz2 248384

This differs from the downloaded file, which has the same size but the md5sum is:
729ee52e77e4d7fe6d0d523f101b8042

Several attempts to download the file have produced the same result.

Can the digest entry be corrected?

Thanks.

Try downloading directly from http://dev.gentoo.org/~jstubbs/releases/portage-2.0.51.21.tar.bz2
The mirrors seem to have a corrupt file. This is being sorted out at the moment.

Hmm.. I just tested a secondary mirror and got the correct file. What mirror are you downloading from?

For debugging purposes, the sequence of events that led to this were:

* Added a file to distfiles-local (md5:01642694d539cc63becb0863d6f9f0e8)
* Found I needed to change it and so removed it, fixed it and added it again about 2 hours after initially adding the file.
* Checked the mirrors and found that the initial version had made it.
* Waited 8 hours (~=2 sync runs?) and checked the mirrors again.
* Found the correct file (md5:6309551a32a71b621d880327e1318a09)
* Uploaded the ebuild

The corrupted download came from:
http://gentoo.mirrors.pair.com/distfiles/portage-2.0.51.21.tar.bz2

Happens once in a while when our master mirror sync overlaps with the file
upload. Just tested and looks good to me.

That "happens once in a while when our master mirror sync overlaps with the 
file upload" is exactly why I reassigned the bug. If you're not concerned with 
fixing it though...

Jason,

It's something we're working on finding a good solution for. It's a race
condition  and something that isn't going to be solved by a quick fix. So please
just calm down.

I'm calm. It's just that resolving the bug implies that you feel the issue is 
closed. I was just stating that I feel differently.
