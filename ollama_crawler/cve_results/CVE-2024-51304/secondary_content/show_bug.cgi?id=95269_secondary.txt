sylpheed-claws crashes after sending an email where the 'Sent' folder is on an
IMAP server (bincimap, in my case).  The message is sent ok and shows up on the
IMAP server, but SC crashes when trying to view it.  See attached --debug output.

Hmm, looks like an unexepcted answer from the server. Any chance you could try
it with another server software just to verify?

Seeing that this is likely limited to one server not much we can do about it.
