Motivation / Background
This Pull Request has been created because ActiveRecord queries do not currently allow unscoping CTEs. There are instances where my team has complex queries that require its CTEs to be unscoped or else we run into issues related to nested CTEs (not allowed) and other issues. We have worked around this issue by extending the QueryMethods in our application to allow unscoping CTEs using the following snippet, but I believe that this change should be upstreamed.
module ActiveRecord
  module QueryMethods
    VALID_UNSCOPING_VALUES += [:with]
  end
end
Detail
This Pull Request appends :with to the set of VALID_UNSCOPING_VALUES in the ActiveRecord::QueryMethods module to allow unscoping CTEs included in a query (relation.with(...)). I expect to be able to unscope CTEs in the same way we can currently unscope selects, wheres, etc...

It looks like tests are failing due to a reason unrelated to the code change (can't connect to server on mysql). Unsure if a user with push access can manually retrigger the check steps or if it's preferable for me to push up an empty commit to retrigger the steps. Feel free to let me know if there is anything that should be done from my end.

Hey, thanks for your PR.
This is just a note about the CI failures, there is a few flakey tests we're aware of. I'm also not sure non-team members can trigger rebuilds in the Buildkite UI -- but a workaround is to just rebase (or commit --amend) and force push, you can squash your commits while you're at it üôè

Thank you for the direction! It looks like the automated tests are passing, but the rails-new-docker step is consistently failing for all new PRs. It seems that it attempts to pull a docker image for a tag that doesn't exist (3.3.2-slim https://hub.docker.com/_/ruby). Previously it was pulling 3.3.1-slim which you can see in the link does exist. Perhaps the version number is changing dynamically somehow? I will check back later and see if builds are passing and do another rebase/amend.
Edit: It looks like 3.3.2 was just released today, so the docker image might take some time to become available. Once it is I'll come back and retrigger the steps again.
