This package fails to build with the doc flag.  I have confirmed it does build without the doc flag.  It appears to have problems finding and running doxygen from inside doxygen (just a cursory glance).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.USE=doc emerge -av1 =x11-libs/fltk-1.3.0_rc6
2.build failure
3.
Actual Results:  
Build error.

Expected Results:  
Successful build.

By the way: This is true since at least 1.3.0 flat.
I had to do a -doc for every release from that to the current one.

Now I just recommend

=x11-libs/fltk-1.3.0* -doc

in /etc/portage/package.use.

Rebuilding texlive-latex and it's first level dependencies resolved this one for me.  Marking as appropriate.

Uuum, that still means it’s a bug. It just means the bug was, that texlive-latex wasn’t rebuilt. Why wasn’t it? Shouldn’t revdep-rebuild have caught it, if not @preserved-rebuild or something?

Because in that case we’d have to remake the bug for that code.

Can you give some details on the cause of the problem, Alex?
Thanks. :)

Well, you have the full build log which outlines the specific problem with fltk but a little background as to why this may not be a bug is in order.

Recently, I had a few system issues due to overheats and full filesystems that were causing (among other things) random little portage failures (checksums not coming back correct, etc).  It could be related to these issues and have nothing to do with the original build of texlive-latex (which was long before these new problems).

If this bug should remain open I'd like to put it back in unconfirmed status to see if anyone else stumbles across it and votes it up.  That way we know if we're justified in fighting it or if it was just a fluke on a system going haywire.

Navid, you mentioned that you had been seeing this one since 1.3.0 proper?  Does rebuilding texlive-latex in the manner I mentioned resolve this for you as well?  I would consider that enough motivation to look into the texlive packages as to why the inconsistency occurred.

Uuum, look at comment 3. I have the same problem. ^^
So it’s not just you, or the overheating. (Unless we both overheated at the exact same point in time.)

Not sure. Anyone who searches for this, will also come across this bug, as filing a new bug has this window above it that, I think, also searches for closed bugs.

> Navid, you mentioned that you had been seeing this one since 1.3.0 proper? 
Yep. It’s not just you. :)

Yes, I just tried it, and it does. USE="-doc" is not needed anymore.

Weird thing. Feel free to look at it, or just wait and see if anyone else stumbles here too. :)
