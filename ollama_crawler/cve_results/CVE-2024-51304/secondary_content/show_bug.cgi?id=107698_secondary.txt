The ebuild of media-video/ati-drivers-8.14.13-r5 I got from
rsync://64.127.121.98/gentoo-portage is broken and has a different MD5SUM
(b349644e1bbe997832e57e9e2bddb72e) than that ebuild file I got from
rsync://134.68.220.74/gentoo-portage (4f11bf3f5fa376bd2d8874c206d96938).

I just synced (not sure which host) and got the following"

/usr/portage/media-video/ati-drivers/ati-drivers-8.14.13-r5.ebuild: line 269:
unexpected EOF while looking for matching `''
/usr/portage/media-video/ati-drivers/ati-drivers-8.14.13-r5.ebuild: line 281:
syntax error: unexpected end of file

!!! ERROR: media-video/ati-drivers-8.14.13-r5 failed.
!!! Function , Line 1772, Exitcode 1
!!! error sourcing ebuild
!!! If you need support, post the topmost build error, NOT this status message.


aux_get(): (0) Error in media-video/ati-drivers-8.14.13-r5 ebuild. (1)
               Check for syntax error or corruption in the ebuild. (--debug)

I got the same error as marduk, seems to be the same as before. 
  
One can get the correct ebuild by putting the following line into make.conf: 
 
SYNC="rsync://134.68.220.74/gentoo-portage" 
 
Don't know, if there are other servers with the right ebuild!

Looks like fine to me, I just tested a download. Looked like a race condition
that fixed itself.
