Description

Issue: sec-keys/openpgp-keys-aepaneshnikov-20211208 fetches file(s) that do not match recorded size.
Discovered on: amd64 (internal ref: guru_tinderbox)

NOTE:
This machine uses lto with CFLAGS=-flto -Werror=odr -Werror=lto-type-mismatch -Werror=strict-aliasing
While the resolution of this bug may be trivial I'd like to suggest to pay attention at WHY and if it is the case of a tarball fraudulently replaced (hacked mirror).
