Description

During boot, for the first time after installation of Gentoo Linux 2005-1, the 
following applications reported errors:
- urandom
- vixie-cron
No log files were generated in the var-directory, so it was not easy to trace 
back what happened.
I also noted that slocate could not build a database. 

The remedy was to create the following subdirectorys into the /var-directory. 
(they were not present after the installation):

/var/run
/var/spool
/var/log
/var/lib/slocate

After this, the programs and logging, seem to work perfectly alright.

This is the very first time I try Gentoo, so it is possible that I could have 
made a misstake during the installation.
During the installation I followed the instructions given on the installation 
CD in Documentation/txt/Installation.txt. I can't see any section where the 
user is instructed to create the directories above. Shouldn't the creation be 
a part of "emerge"?

I'm pretty sure the stages include these directories (except for
/var/lib/slocate,  but that's up to slocate ebuild to create that one).
