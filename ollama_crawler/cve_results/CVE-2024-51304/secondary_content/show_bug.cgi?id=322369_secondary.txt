/sbin/tw_cli has the permissions 755. But that is useless because when executing as normal user, there comes the message from tw_cli 
"Only root/administrator can run this program."

standard permissions should be adequate to program usage demands (root:root 700 ?)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. run /sbin/tw_cli as unprivileged user

Actual Results:  
exit code 1 with message
"Only root/administrator can run this program."

Expected Results:  
message
"/sbin/tw_cli: Permission denied"

/sbin is not in $PATH for normal user exactly because you are not supposed to be executing them without root.  there is no suid/sgid involved here, therefore it would be pointless to make it 700.  you pretty much created the "problem" yourself by trying to execute it with full path.
