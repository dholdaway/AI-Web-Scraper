/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/11.2.0/../../../../x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/bin/ld: /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/11.2.0/../../../../lib64/libevview3.so: undefined reference to `gdk_wayland_display_get_type'

Probably app-text/evince needs to be rebuilt.

Looks similar to https://bugs.gentoo.org/677292

Thank you, it works. 

Should i run `emerge -v1 $(equery depends gtk+ | cut -f1)` in addition?
