I tested Ardour8 on two different machines (Desktop and Laptop) both running amd64.
When using the mark tool and applying "FFT analysis" via the mouse context menu, Ardour crashes immediately. 

On the console window I can see this (starting from the point when using the FFT function):

free(): invalid next size (normal)
Abgebrochen
martin@kellerkind ~ $ Cannot write socket fd = 24 err = Broken pipe
CheckRes error
Could not write notification
ClientNotify fails name = ardour notification = 12 val1 = 1 val2 = 5
Cannot write socket fd = 24 err = Broken pipe

ClientNotify fails name = ardour notification = 12 val1 = 2 val2 = 5

ClientNotify fails name = ardour notification = 12 val1 = 29 val2 = 21
Cannot write socket fd = 24 err = Broken pipe

## CUT HERE - this happens multiple times ##
ClientNotify fails name = ardour notification = 10 val1 = 30 val2 = 0
Cannot write socket fd = 24 err = Broken pipe
CheckRes error
Could not write notification
ClientNotify fails name = ardour notification = 10 val1 = 31 val2 = 0
Cannot write socket fd = 24 err = Broken pipe
CheckRes error
Could not write notification
ClientNotify fails name = ardour notification = 10 val1 = 32 val2 = 0
Unknown error...
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'Jack::JackTemporaryException'
  what():  
martin@kellerkind ~ $ 



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Ardour
2.Import or generate a sample
3.Select a part of the sample
4.Right mouse button --> FFT Analysis
5.Crash!!!
Actual Results:  
FFT analysis function currently unusable due to crash

Expected Results:  
A window will open and display the spectrum of the selected part of the sample

8 is not in the tree anymore, there were many fixes in 8.1 and now also 8.2 is in the tree. so please test at least one of these versions and report back whether the issue persists for you.

Indeed, 8.1 seems to work. So this issue can be closed. Thanks a lot!
