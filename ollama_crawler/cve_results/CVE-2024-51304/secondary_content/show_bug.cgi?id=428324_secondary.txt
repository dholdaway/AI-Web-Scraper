By default portage will not replace any config file in case of a conflict (e.g. package upgrade).

I suggest this behavior to be changed, and portage to replace a config without asking the user if the config is the default (i.e. unchanged) as provided by the previous package.

This's like replicating apt's behavior.

Reproducible: Always

how is this different from FEATURES="config-protect-if-modified"?

a news-item has been sent out to notify you of this being made default

It's not different at all!
