Revision 83452 probably would have caused this, but it was reverted in revision 83632. From the log, you were building 83574, which falls between those two revs.

http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=83452
http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=83632

Please try again.
