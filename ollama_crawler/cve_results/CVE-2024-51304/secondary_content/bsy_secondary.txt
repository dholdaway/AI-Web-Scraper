 Inside Bentley Systems Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
We follow the applicable guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition with respect to uncertain tax positions.



 Financial - Debt   Highlight
Such debt instruments also could introduce new or modified covenants that might restrict our operations and/or our ability to pay dividends, consummate acquisitions, or otherwise pursue our business strategies.

 M & A - Other   Highlight
In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and, if such events occur, we may be required to record a charge against the value ascribed to an acquired asset or an increase in the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities.

 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
Our results of operations have been, and in the future will be, affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
In the event we determine that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets is not more likely than not to be realized, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded that would increase the provision for income taxes.
