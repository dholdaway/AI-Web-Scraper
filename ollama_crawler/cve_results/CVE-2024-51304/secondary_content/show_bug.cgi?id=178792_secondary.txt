I noticed the dev-php4/eaccelerator-0.9.5 ebuild has changed (removal of the apache USE flag) to reflect the removal of apache-1.x from portage.  Should the ebuild not be marked with a *-r1 for this change?

Reproducible: Always

Not really any reason for this. The stuff is p.masked and people will upgrade sooner or later or switch to some overlay.
