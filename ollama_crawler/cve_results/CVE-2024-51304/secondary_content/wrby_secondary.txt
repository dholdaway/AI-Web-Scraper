 Inside Warby Parker Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
In particular, rising interest and inflation rates, geopolitical unrest, and other macroeconomic factors have caused disruption in the global financial markets, which could reduce our ability to access capital and negatively affect our liquidity in the future.



 Other - Other   Highlight
We expect that operating losses could continue in the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in the expansion of our business.

 Other - Other   Highlight
However, unforeseen adverse future economic and market conditions, such as those resulting from disease pandemics and other catastrophic events, could result in our actual results differing materially from our estimates.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in professional costs incurred in 2021 related to our Direct Listing and tender offer that were not recurring in 2022, as well as decreased marketing, stock-based compensation charges and related employer payroll taxes, and Home Try-On program costs.

 Financial - Debt   Highlight
The incurrence of debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the instruments governing such debt could provide for additional operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations.
