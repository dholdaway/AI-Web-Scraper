Description


Agostino Sarubbo






          2011-06-01 08:35:36 UTC
        

Example from log:

x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-gcc -O3 -march=native -O2 -g0 -I. -I/usr/include -I./../include  -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -c argus.c


amd64box ~ # emerge --info | grep CFLAGS
CFLAGS="-march=native -O2 -g0"


So, my cflag "-O?" overwrites "-O3" appended by buildsystem, but if i not declare "-O?" in my cflags it will compiled with "-O3", so:

CFLAGS="" emerge argus produces:


x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-gcc -O3  -I. -I/usr/include -I./../include  -I./../argus -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -Dyylval=argus_lval -c grammar.c


thanks

Build system provides defaults and user allowed to override. I don't see any problem here...
