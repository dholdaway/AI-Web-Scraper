x11-terms/root-tail install its HTML manpage in /usr/share/doc/xorg-x11-VERSION/html. I think it should rather go to .../root-tail-VERSION/html. The following patch fixes that, using the eclass from bug 90789.

Reproducible: Always

The prefix eclass is not coming; so I'll attempt to fix this by hand.

appears to no longer be a problem?  Reopen if that is not the case (it installs correctly for me)
