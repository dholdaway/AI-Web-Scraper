I updated spidermonkey and found that gpac depends on it, even though it's not in its dependencies:

>>> package: dev-lang/spidermonkey-1.8.2.15-r1
 *  - /usr/lib64/libjs.so
 *      used by /usr/bin/elinks (www-client/elinks-0.12_pre5-r1)
 *      used by /usr/lib64/gpac/gm_gpac_js.so (media-video/gpac-0.4.5-r5)
 *      used by /usr/lib64/libgpac-0.4.5.so (media-video/gpac-0.4.5-r5)

# ldd /usr/lib64/libgpac-0.4.5.so | grep libjs
	libjs.so => /usr/lib64/libjs.so (0x00007fd796d52000)

Reproducible: Always

This is 0.4.5-r5 you installed or 0.4.5-r4 ?  -r4 has the dependency on <spidermonkey-1.8.5

It was gpac-0.4.5-r5 (you can see in the preserved-libs output above). Spidermonkey is not in -r5's dependencies.

I could not reproduce this by emerging gpac-0.4.5-r5 with dev-lang/spidermonkey-1.8.2.15-r1 installed.

As --use-js=no is set in the ebuild, and to me this seems to be properly disabling the link-time dependencies against javascript in the build system (in addition to the fact that my build didn't result in a libgpac-0.4.5.so that was linked to libjs.so), could you provide some additional info if you can still reproduce this?

emerge --info , build.log , confirmation that it's the in-tree copy of gpac-0.4.5-r5 and not a local overlay copy, etc..

please reopen if this issue persists (with this version or newer ones)
