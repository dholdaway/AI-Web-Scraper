Hello!
I've successfully emerged emacs-24.5-r1 (with flags: X acl alsa dbus gif gpm gtk gtk3 inotify jpeg png ssl svg tiff xpm zlib).

After trying to run it from terminal I see two processes: emacs and 
`/usr/bin/X -nolisten tcp -auth /var/run/sddm/{4fe3cb0d-59ed-4ede-bfe7-7d8977fdca23} -background none -noreset -displayfd 17 vt1` - each eating one core's 100% time.

I have tried the same USE flags and got a working emacs which does not consume 100% CPU. Perhaps something different is broken on your system.

We can not help you efficiently via bug tracker. The bug tracker aims rather on specific problems in .ebuilds and less on individual systems. 

I have had very good experience on the gentoo IRC [1] with questions like this. Of course there are also forums and mailing lists [3,4].

I hope you understand, that I will close the bug here therefore and wish you good luck on one of the mentioned channels.
