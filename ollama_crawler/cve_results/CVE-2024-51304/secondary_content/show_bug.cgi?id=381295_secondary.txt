The bookmark star in the address bar is dysfunctional. While I can bookmark pages by clicking on it nothing happens when I click it a second time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on bookmark star, it turns yellow
2.Click it again.

Actual Results:  
Nothing happens when clicking the bookmark star the second time. Or if the page has already been bookmarked nothing happens when clicking the first time.

Expected Results:  
I (kind of) popup should open which allows the user to delete, move, and otherwise edit the bookmark.

I suspect chromium (or one of it's dependencies) has a dependency which is not properly declared but is usually installed for most people anyway. I have created my own portage profile which removes a lot of cruft. Maybe a side-effect of this is that that dependency is not pulled in.

Also it does not make much sense if I provide my profile in this case; you wouldn't know what it looks like anyway. So instead I list the effective useflags. Please let me know what other information would be useful.

Could you please provide the version number of www-client/chromium?

Working fine for me on 15.0.865.0.

On the first click, the star turns yellow and the bookmark bubble appears with options for editing/delete.

I doubt we are going to track this one down unless provided with more specific information about exactly what triggers it.

Also working fine here. Feel free to re-open with full emerge --info, and maybe version of gtk+ and also - does it work in www-client/google-chrome? Does it work with any version of www-client/chromium?
