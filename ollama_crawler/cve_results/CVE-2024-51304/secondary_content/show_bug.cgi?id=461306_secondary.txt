With repoman from portage-2.1.11.55 I get spurious warnings about unquoted variables:

$ repoman

RepoMan scours the neighborhood...
  ebuild.minorsyn               3
   app-editors/emacs/emacs-23.4-r5.ebuild: Unquoted Variable on line: 286
   app-editors/emacs/emacs-24.3_rc2.ebuild: Unquoted Variable on line: 290
   app-editors/emacs/emacs-24.3_rc3.ebuild: Unquoted Variable on line: 290

Note: use --without-mask to check KEYWORDS on dependencies of masked packages
Note: use --include-dev (-d) to check dependencies for 'dev' profiles

RepoMan sez: "You're only giving me a partial QA payment?
              I'll take it this time, but I'm not happy."


In lines 289 to 291 of emacs-24.3_rc3.ebuild it can be seen that the variable really is within a quoted string:

    use aqua && DOC_CONTENTS+="\\n\\nEmacs${EMACS_SUFFIX#emacs}.app is in
        ${EPREFIX}/Applications/Gentoo. You may want to copy or symlink it
        into /Applications by yourself."

The "unquoted variable" check really checks that ${EPREFIX} is quoted such that any whitespace it contains does not mix with surrounding whitespace. So, it triggers for your ${EPREFIX} reference because there are no quotes to separate ${EPREFIX} from surrounding whitespace. The following form should pass the check:


     use aqua && DOC_CONTENTS+="\\n\\nEmacs${EMACS_SUFFIX#emacs}.app is in
        '${EPREFIX}/Applications/Gentoo'. You may want to copy or symlink it
        into /Applications by yourself."
