Tilda doesn't start. It segfault at start. Recompilation with empty CFLAGS and LDFLAGS doesn't help.

Reproducible: Always

Could you please provide a little more info? You can add split-debug to your FEATURES in make.conf and then run it through gdb and attach the log here for example.

I've installed gdb. There is output of gdb run:

Reading symbols from /usr/bin/tilda...Reading symbols from /usr/lib/debug/usr/bin/tilda.debug...done.
(no debugging symbols found)...done.
(gdb) run
Starting program: /usr/bin/tilda 
[Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled]
[New Thread 0xb6e63b90 (LWP 15168)]

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
tilda_keygrabber_bind (keystr=0x0, tw=0x8085540) at key_grabber.c:260
260	    if (strcmp ("", keystr) == 0)

The problem is in updeting configs from old vertion. After removing ~/.tilda directory tilda starts and work fine. So we can close bug as WORKSFORME or UPSTREAM
