Hi
updating to plasma 6 gentoo
my final block was 
Total: 330 packages (36 upgrades, 34 new, 242 in new slots, 18 reinstalls, 163 uninstalls), Size of downloads: 0 KiB
Conflict: 173 blocks (1 unsatisfied)

 * Error: The above package list contains packages which cannot be
 * installed at the same time on the same system.

  (kde-apps/kdegraphics-mobipocket-23.08.5:5/5::gentoo, installed) pulled in by
    kde-apps/kdegraphics-mobipocket:5 required by (kde-frameworks/kfilemetadata-5.116.0:5/5.116::gentoo, ebuild scheduled for merge) USE="epub exif ffmpeg mobi pdf taglib -debug -doc -test" ABI_X86="(64)"

it turns out this is caused by USE="mobi" 
removing mobi from use solve the block
found this a bit odd thought it would be worth mentioning
else sorry for the noise


Reproducible: Always

You can have USE=mobi - but only *either* on kfilemetadata:5 *or* kfilemetadata:6, not both of them.

thanks for the clarification.

It's annoying as  I had the "mobi" use flag as global.
I thought as I upgraded to plasma6 and app 24.05.1
I would be without anything related to 5

I forgot as it was mentioned somewhere on gentoo that not all 24.05.1 apps would be moved to kde-frameworks 6 but some will still depend on kde-frameworks 5
in my case 
equery d kde-frameworks/kfilemetadata
showed me the culprit
it's caused by k3b-24.05.1
removed it and I can keep my global "mobi" use flag

Thanks
