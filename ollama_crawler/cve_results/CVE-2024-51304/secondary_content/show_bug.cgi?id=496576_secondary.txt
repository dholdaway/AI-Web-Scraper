Description

In hb-install-x86+amd64-disk.xml

Device Boot Start End Blocks Id System
/dev/sda1 1 3 5198+ ef EFI (FAT-12/16/32)
/dev/sda2 3 14 105808+ 83 Linux

Sda1 is 2 megabytes long, so it is from 1 to 3, but sda2 is 128 megabytes now, why it is from 3 to 14 megabyte?

Reproducible: Always

I don't think fdisk uses megabytes but I/O size or sector size. The example is made from a virtual system with a non-default sector size (64 Mb) I believe, which provides the somewhat weird numbers.

If you're doing a Gentoo installation using the exact information as used in the handbook, I'll gladly substitute with the right numbers, but I don't think having this example in right now is really a bug, not?

I'd only want to change the numbers when I know it is an improvement that can't be re-discussed. Changing it to what we "think" would be (like 128*1024*2, starting from 2048) would probably not be sufficient as the "Blocks" column will also need to be adapted.

Simply, if bios partition is 2 megabytes, and it between 1 and 3, than "1" - is 1 megabyte?

OK, we will wait, until someone installs gentoo as in handbook.

Considering this bug is open for more than a year with no additional reports, I am going to close it. Updates can occur on the Discussion page if necessary (now that the instructions are moved to the wiki).
