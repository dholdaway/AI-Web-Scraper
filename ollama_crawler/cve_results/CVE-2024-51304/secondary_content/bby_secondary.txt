“I’m proud of the performance of our teams across the company as they showed resourcefulness, passion, and an unwavering focus on our customers this past year,” said Corie Barry, Best Buy CEO. “In the fourth quarter and throughout FY24, we demonstrated strong operational execution as we navigated a pressured consumer electronics sales environment. This allowed us to deliver annual profitability at the high end of our original guidance range even though sales came in below our original guidance range. Importantly, we grew our paid membership base and drove customer experience improvements in many areas of our business, particularly in services and delivery.” 


﻿


“As we enter FY25, we are energized about delivering on our purpose to Enrich Lives through Technology in our vibrant, always changing industry,” continued Barry. “In what we expect to be a year of increasing industry sales stabilization, we are focused on sharpening our customer experiences and industry positioning while maintaining, if not expanding, our operating income rate on a 52-week basis.”

 Inside Best Buy Co Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.



 Other - Other   Highlight
Further declines in the excess of fair value over book value could arise in future years, which could lead to an impairment of goodwill.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
The decrease in International revenue in fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by comparable sales declines across most of our product categories and the negative impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
International operating income rate decreased in fiscal 2024, primarily due to an unfavorable SG&A rate that was driven by decreased leverage from lower sales volume on our fixed expenses and an unfavorable gross profit rate.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
Domestic operating income rate decreased in fiscal 2024, primarily due to an unfavorable SG&A rate that was driven by decreased leverage from lower sales volume on our fixed expenses, partially offset by favorability in gross profit rate.
