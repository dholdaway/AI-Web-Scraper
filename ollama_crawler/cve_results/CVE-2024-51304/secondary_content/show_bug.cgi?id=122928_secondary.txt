Description


Erik McNellis





          2006-02-15 07:40:25 UTC
        

when trying to emerge sci-chemistry/vmd,the result is as follows:

hostname ~ # emerge vmd
Calculating dependencies ...done!
>>> emerge (1 of 1) sci-chemistry/vmd-1.8.3 to /
!!! Files listed in the manifest do not exist!
.ChangeLog.swp
hostname ~ #

Cause: There are MD5, SHA and RMD keys listed for the ChangeLog swap file in the /usr/portage/sci-chemistry/vmd/Manifest file, but the swap file is naturally not included in the ebuild.

Fix: Comment out / remove these keys.
