build.log

The configure phase fails with:

CMake Error at cmake/modules/FindClang.cmake:118 (message):
  Could not find Clang builtin directory
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  plugins/CMakeLists.txt:39 (find_package)

I have the same issues with LLVM/Clang 12. I've had a look through the cmake files referenced but am not sure where it's going wrong.

CMakeOutput.log contains nothing useful from what I see, but I'll attach it anyways.

Cheers
