Building app-emulation/vkd3d-1.1 using "-j9 -l4" as MAKEOPTS fails with:

> make -j9 -l4 
> make  all-am
> make[1]: Entering directory '/var/tmp/portage/app-emulation/vkd3d-1.1/work/vkd3d-1.1-> abi_x86_32.x86'
> /bin/sh: libs/vkd3d_version.c: No such file or directory
> make[1]: *** [Makefile:1823: libs/vkd3d_version.c] Error 1
> make[1]: Leaving directory '/var/tmp/portage/app-emulation/vkd3d-1.1/work/vkd3d-1.1-> > abi_x86_32.x86'
> make: *** [Makefile:781: all] Error 2

Building with MAKEOPTS="-j1" succeeds.
