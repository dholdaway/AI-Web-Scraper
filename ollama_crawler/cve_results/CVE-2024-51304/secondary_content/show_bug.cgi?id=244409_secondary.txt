When turning on desktop effects in KDE 4.1.2 using GTK+, all windows, including the desktop background, turn into so many black and white squares. No text or other info is visible - just literally black and white squares where windows used to be. Desktop effects does not crash like this when using x-render, but not all selected effects do what they purport to do. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open System Settings in KDE 4.1.2
2. Select "Desktop"
3. Select the "general" tab
4. Check "enable desktop effects"
5. Click "advanced options"
6. Make sure GTK+ is the selected method
7. Click "apply" in the System Settings window

Actual Results:  
Screen turns into solid black and white squares. 

Expected Results:  
Desktop effects!

This is upstream issue, but anyway does it happen with 4.2?

I guess you're confusing GTK+ with OpenGL here.
I'm renaming bug, please confirm.

As well try with recent 4.2.3 as scarabeus said, and paste emerge --info *if* issue is still present for you in 4.2.3.
