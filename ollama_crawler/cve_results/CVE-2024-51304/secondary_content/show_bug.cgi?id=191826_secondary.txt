Description

It looks like XCalc.ad and XCalc-color.ad are not installed into /etc/X11/app-defaults

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. "xcalc -rpn" shows black & white image since new XCalc-color resources are unavailable.

Actual Results:  
After un-bzipping the xcalc tar ball & cd'ing into xcalc-1.0.2, I did:

cp XCalc-color.ad /etc/X11/app-defaults/XCalc-color

Expected Results:  
Colorful xcalc in RPN mode!

They're installed in /usr/share/X11/app-defaults. And just specifying the -rpn flag doesn't bring color, as the manpage says you have to change your own xresources file to have this...

*customization:  -color

and use xrdb to reload.

This is a strace output to show you it's search order.

access("/etc/X11/C/app-defaults/XCalc", R_OK) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
access("/etc/X11/app-defaults/XCalc", R_OK) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
access("/etc/X11/C/app-defaults/XCalc", R_OK) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
access("/etc/X11/app-defaults/XCalc", R_OK) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
access("/usr/share/X11/C/app-defaults/XCalc", R_OK) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
access("/usr/share/X11/app-defaults/XCalc", R_OK) = 0
stat64("/usr/share/X11/app-defaults/XCalc", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=19405, ...}) = 0
open("/usr/share/X11/app-defaults/XCalc", O_RDONLY) = 4

Re-open if there's still trouble.
