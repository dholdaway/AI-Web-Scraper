probably adobe has removed it from its server.

@bobb, please do not add arch team by yourself

Agostino, let the package maintainer decide on the bug severity

I just tried fetching it, and it succeeded.

The error message you have says:
  "Resolving fpdownload.macromedia.com... failed: Name or service not known."

That looks to me like a DNS lookup or resolv.conf error.

Please try again, I really hope it's just an odd temporary glitch on your end of the internet.
