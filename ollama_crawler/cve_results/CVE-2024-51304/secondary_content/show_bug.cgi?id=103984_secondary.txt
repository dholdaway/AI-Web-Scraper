I just tested with the same card (3C905B) and it worked just fine.  Also, since
the Handbook tells you how to start yourt ethernet if it doesn't automatically
start, I'd consider this a WONTFIX unless you had some kind of patch to resolve
the issue for your machine, as it works perfectly for me on several machines.
