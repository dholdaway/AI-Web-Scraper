Please add new ebuild for new Intel 7620 wireless cards ucode.

Ucode can be found here: http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/iwlwifi?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=iwlwifi-7260-ucode-22.0.7.0.tgz

Bug summary is wrong: topic is 7260, not 7620, a model which doesn't exist at all.

Newer firmwares are already in the tree, compare list at http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/iwlwifi

But the most recent version for 3.14+ 23.214.9.0 is not, so this bug should become a bump for this version.

i think linux-firmware provides all firmware now including these.  we want to kill of the split iwl firmwares where possible.
