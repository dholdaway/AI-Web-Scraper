according to startx the xorg server starts up ok. I can use xfce all ok,but when
trying to login with kdm the greeter screen keeps reappearing. My login is accepted,
as if I try to relogin on another xterminal I'm told I am already logged in

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start machine
2.login appears login & passwd entered,screen changes to startup gets to world icon
3.screen goes black, and relogin screen reappears
Actual Results:  
keeps repeating the login

Expected Results:  
expect the system to start

Are you sure that consolekit is started? If you installed kdm with consolekit support you must start it.

Ok that wasn't successful everything loaded up ok,and doesn't matter whether user or root login still fails,all of pam openssh have been rebuilt,I dont have any hassles with xfce or lxde,just kde,I'm stumped. I suppose I could trash the system and rebuild it all over again,but really don't see how thats going to change anything as this's the 2nd time I've rebuilt.

Various nvidia-driver versions have been making trouble (sorry for being vague, but I dont have the details handy at the moment). Best thing might be to up- or downgrade that and try...

Neither do I now,apart from the cmos batt failing,which by the time I had enough info to cure that problem,the hdd had been replaced,and system rebuilt from scratch.
At present running an all kde system 4.7.2 with no hassles in this area.
