 Inside Workday, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Income   Highlight
Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our provision for (benefit from) income taxes in the period in which we make the change.



 Other - Other   Highlight
Recent macroeconomic events including higher inflation and interest rates, as well as geopolitical factors including the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas conflicts, have negatively impacted the global economy and created continued uncertainty, volatility, and disruption of financial markets.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Periodically, we review whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Any of these factors could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.

 Other - Other   Highlight
While we do not currently expect Pillar Two to have a material impact on our effective tax rate, our analysis is ongoing and incomplete, and it is possible that Pillar Two could have a material adverse effect on our tax liability.
