 Inside Nexstar Media Group, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Expense   Highlight
However, a downgrade in the Company’s credit rating could adversely affect its ability to renew the existing credit facilities, obtain access to new credit facilities or otherwise issue debt in the future and could increase the cost of such debt.



 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
Any future adverse economic conditions, including those resulting from heightened and sustained inflation and higher interest rates, could adversely affect the Company’s future operating results, cash flows and financial condition.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Actual results may differ from those estimates, and any such differences could be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Other - Other   Highlight
In applying accounting and disclosure requirements, we must base our decision to consolidate an entity on quantitative and qualitative factors that indicate whether or not we have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly affect its economic performance and whether or not we have the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.

 Other - Other   Highlight
We are, therefore, not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.
