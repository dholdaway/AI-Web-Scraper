When I try to emerge knotes-3.5.2, I get:

# emerge -a knotes

These are the packages that would be merged, in order:

Calculating dependencies... done!
[ebuild  N    ] kde-base/knotes-3.5.2  USE="arts -debug -kdeenablefinal -kdehiddenvisibility -xinerama"

Would you like to merge these packages? [Yes/No]

Oops, I just did an emerge sync and this seems to have solved the problem.

Sorry.
