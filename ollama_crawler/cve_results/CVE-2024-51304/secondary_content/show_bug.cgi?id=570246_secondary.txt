zx2c4@thinkpad ~ $ audacity 
Fatal Error: Mismatch between the program and library build versions detected.
The library used 2.8 (no debug,Unicode,compiler with C++ ABI 1002,wx containers,compatible with 2.6),
and your program used 2.8 (no debug,Unicode,compiler with C++ ABI 1009,wx containers,compatible with 2.6).
Aborted

Using gcc 5.3.

Recompiling either wxGTK or Audacity does not fix the problem.

I think you should rebuild everything C++:

https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Upgrading_from_gcc-4.x_to_gcc-5.x

it works fine here
