nvidia-kernel-1.0.7167-r1 and nvidia-glx-1.0.7167-r1 cause the the pc to freeze when openning website with live video contents (both konqueror and firefox). It really freezes hard, the keyboard is not reponding, the screeen freezes, only the mouse cursor moves but the mouse buttons have no response. The only way to get out is to recycle the power.

Downgrade to the earlier version (1.0.6629-r4) and problem just go away.

This sounds similar to a problem some people (including me) are having with websites while using the new drivers. Tentatively we think the problem is with GIF images, but honestly, who knows.

Forum postings:

What crashes one box works fine on another, but very laggily-so at first, and the majority of websites work fine. I'd guess this is going straight upstream, if Nvidia doesn't already know.

Check this on the kde-linux list. I was unable to find the forum post in question, and have not tested this myself.

When starting KDE with this version of nVidia driver, the same thing happens.

If you log into the system remotely, you can kill off X and the system recovers.

I cannot confirm this bug. All the named pages works for me, and I do not have the "fix" from the kdelist.

Tried the latest driver, nvidia-kernel-1.0.7174 and nvidia-kernel-1.0.7174, the problem seemed to be worst. The moment I open the MSN hotmail loggin page with konqueror, my pc freezes. For the time being I am staying put on the 1.0.6629 driver as it is stable.

I can trigger it quite reliably on different slides of that page.
