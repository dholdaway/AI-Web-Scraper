Description

Hi,

As tove pointed to $URL, can we please have a bugzilla note ( like the one for security bugs) about maintainer-wanted ( maybe a short message poking user to look at sunrise project ) or maintainer-needed ( same but for proxy-maint project). That would be really useful and we can finally stop posting the same comment over and over

Thanks

The mechanism used for security bugs cannot be applied here. It's a pure CSS implementation that uses CSS classes set by bugzie for product and component as a trigger to display the message. There is no such thing for the assignee or CC list.
So implementing this might take some time.

At any rate, please clarify
a) when exactly to show a message (maintainer-wanted as assignee, or in cc?)
b) what text to use (HTML snippet)

I understand the problem. 

Ok for maintainer-wanted we would like something like this 

"The sunrise team can help you write and commit an ebuild for this package to sunrise overlay"

for maintainer-needed we want something like this 

"This package has no maintainer. Contact proxy-maint@gentoo.org if you would like to proxy maintain it."

The maintainer-{needed,wanted} have to be the assignee of the bug

Ping, would definitely be nice to have; implementation shouldn't be too hard, basically where the current check for the security product / component is done you can easily add another check that checks the assignee.

See #c1 on why it's not that easy.

The code is in place for security, you don't need to write anything from scratch and just add similar code for m-w and m-n; I've already read your comment, and in my response I intent to refer to the code that adds those classes the CSS magic you use is based on.

Tom, that CSS magic uses Product "Gentoo Security" and is unusable in the case where we have to rely on CC or assignee fields.

Whether it needs to look at the product, assignee or CC does not matter.

Let's say I have:

> print 'class="'
> if bug.product == "Gentoo Security" then
>     print 'gentoo-security-warning'
> endif
> print '"'

How hard do you think this is to adapt to assignee or CC? Easy:

> print 'class="'
> if bug.assignee == "maintainer-needed@gentoo.org" or bug.assignee == "maintainer-wanted@gentoo.org" or bug.CC.contains("maintainer-needed@gentoo.org") or bug.CC.contains("maintainer-wanted@gentoo.org") then
>     print 'gentoo-maintainer-welcome'
> endif
> print '"'

I really don't see the problem; or why this would be unusable, it is not...

As shown, the same mechanism can be applied.

You might want to rethink the tone in which you address people.
Also, patches are actually welcome.

Happy to help, which sources do I need to write a patch against?

Created attachment 354012 [details, diff]
gentoo-bugzilla-maintainer-notes.patch

See attached patch, this adds a class to the body and then we apply the same CSS.

This can in the future be extended by adding another ELSIF branch and CSS rule.

Tested and works, applies with -p1 against all branches of gentoo-bugzilla.

Didn't notice this was already reported :S

Could Tom's patch be considered? :)

Thanks!

rather than hardcode specific addresses in the show-header.html.tmpl, does the templating logic allow for globs/regexes ?  i.e. what if patched login to .*@gentoo.org$, and set the note to the e-mail address before the @gentoo.org ?

we could adopt the current security warning too so it'd apply whenever it's assigned to security@g.o in addition to the Security product.

It is my understanding that this is already implemented for maintainer-needed by the hackaround solution of setting the user's realname, and that sunrise is now officially dead.
