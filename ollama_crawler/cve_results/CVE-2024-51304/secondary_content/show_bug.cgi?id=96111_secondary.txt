hi, this is a rewrite of mod_lisp for apache2 
please find attached mod_lisp2-1.2.ebuild
as well as 10_mod_lisp2.conf which should
be called files/10_mod_lisp2.conf  because that's where it goes

by the way, if it installs properly you 
still shouldn't be able to see anything if you
go to http://localhost/lisp except an internal server 
error, because it's going to try to connect to a lisp 
server, and the lisp isn't going to be there unless 
you actually ran one.
