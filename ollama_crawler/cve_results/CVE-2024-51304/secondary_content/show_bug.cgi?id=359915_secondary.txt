Bluez completes configure stage successfully but fails on make.
Running a manual "make" in /var/tmp/portage/net-wireless/bluez-4.87/work/bluez-4.87/ completes successfully, performing also more tasks than when run via emerge.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge bluez

Actual Results:  
then watch it fail during make

Expected Results:  
running make manually it generates lib/bluetooth/bluetooth.h

hrm

seems like bluez's make is not threadsafe.
-j1 makes it compile without problems.
