Description

When I install courier package, everything that's contained gets installed. in some situations, this is overkill. When I only want a full-featured nullmailer replacement, I don't need webmail, pop3d or imapd (and all the SSL versions).

Looking to debian, they make single packages for the applications. I thing Gentoo could do this very well with USE-Flags.
I think bug #84288 is related to this: Webmaild doen't even need to be compiled on many systems (runtime configuration cannot be replaced by this one!).

So I suggest either adding a "courier-minimal" package that only compiles courierd and everything needed for outbound esmtp (with starttls and authentication) or (my preference) adding some local use-flags.

This bug has been obsoleted by my new ebuild files. there are use-flags for the optional components and IMAP/POP3 can be disabled via configuration.
