                                                      Exhibit 99.1Wintrust Financial Corporation9700 W. Higgins Road, Suite 800, Rosemont, Illinois 60018News ReleaseFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 17, 2024FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:Timothy S. Crane, President & Chief Executive OfficerDavid A. Dykstra, Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer(847) 939-9000 Web site address: www.wintrust.comWintrust Financial Corporation Reports Record Full Year Net IncomeROSEMONT, ILLINOIS – Wintrust Financial Corporation (“Wintrust”, “the Company”, “we” or “our”) (Nasdaq: WTFC) announced record annual net income of $622.6 million or $9.58 per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to net income of $509.7 million or $8.02 per diluted common share for the same period of 2022, an increase in diluted earnings per common share of 19%. Pre-tax, pre-provision income (non-GAAP) totaled a record $959.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, up 23% as compared to $779.1 million in the same period of 2022. The Company recorded quarterly net income of $123.5 million or $1.87 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to $164.2 million or $2.53 per diluted common share for the third quarter of 2023. Pre-tax, pre-provision income (non-GAAP) totaled $208.2 million as compared to $244.8 million for the third quarter of 2023. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company recognized an accrual of $34.4 million for the estimated amount owed as a result of the FDIC special assessment on uninsured deposits in response to certain bank failures occurring earlier in 2023 as well as a $9.7 million unfavorable net valuation adjustment from certain mortgage-related assets held at fair value.Timothy S. Crane, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We are very pleased with our strong 2023 results, including record net income for the full year 2023. Throughout the year, we continued to leverage our position in the markets we serve to sustain steady growth in loans and deposits. Wintrust finished the year with great momentum as our fourth quarter results were highlighted by record net interest income, increased net interest margin and growth in our loan portfolio while continuing to exhibit low levels of net charge-offs.” Additionally, Mr. Crane noted, “Given current economic conditions, we continue to feel good about the position of our businesses throughout our footprint. Opportunities in our markets exist to grow earning assets and deposits.  Our net interest margin for the fourth quarter continued to stay within our expected range, increasing by two basis points. In the current interest rate environment, we still expect to maintain our net interest margin within a narrow range around current levels during the first quarter of 2024 and stay relatively stable for the remainder of 2024, depending on the pace and magnitude of potential interest rate changes. We believe this stability in net interest margin along with steady growth will drive strong financial performance in future quarters.”Highlights of the fourth quarter of 2023:Comparative information to the third quarter of 2023, unless otherwise noted•Net interest margin increased by two basis points to 3.62% (3.64% on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, non-GAAP) during the fourth quarter of 2023.◦The higher net interest margin as well as growth in earning assets drove record quarterly net interest income of $470.0 million, increasing $7.6 million.•Total loans increased by $686 million, or 7% annualized. •Total deposits increased by $404 million, or 4% annualized.•Total assets increased by $705 million, or 5% annualized.•Impacts compared to the third quarter of 2023 from changes in the interest rate environment during the fourth quarter of 2023 included the following:The following information was filed by Wintrust Financial Corp (WTFC) on Wednesday, January 17, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.
