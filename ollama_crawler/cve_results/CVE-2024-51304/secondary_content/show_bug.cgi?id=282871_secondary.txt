The documentation in /usr/share/doc/freedts-0.82-r2 simply redirects to documentation on http://www.freetds.org/. I have been unable to access this domain, even 'dig freetds.org ns' returns NXDOMAIN, from either work or home.

I'm sorry a simple reply takes so long. We can't do anything about freetds.org. 

And i don't know about your current setup but the documentation on that site is perfectly accessible to me (just used it to work on another bug ;)
As we try to stay with what upstream ships, we won't include documentation tarballs unless upstream ships them, too.
