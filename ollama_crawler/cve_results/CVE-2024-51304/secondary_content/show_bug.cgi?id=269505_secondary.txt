Description

Emerged x11-misc/xhkeys and went about trying to configure it using xhkconf - the configuration utility that comes in the package.
How ever I noticed it would pretend after configuring a key that I hadn't done so and gave me the menu option again instead of the expected 'confirm this binding'.
Thinking this just odd and just a change since I last used xhkeys years ago, I ran xhkeys which complained about no configuration file - clearly none had been created.
I created an empty ~/.XHkeys configuration file with touch, afterward xhkconf works as expected and xhkeys was happy with a configuration file to play with.

Basically: The configuration of xhkeys by xhkconf isn't possibly on a fresh emerge as xhkconf doesn't create a blank configuration file to write to.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Emerge xhkeys with no pre-existing configuration file (~/.XHkeys) or just rename your existing one
2. Attempt to bind a key by xhkconf (setup utility)
3. Run xhkeys or manually look for ~/.XHkeys configuration file

Actual Results:  
When you attempt to use xhkconf to configure a key it repeats the menu listing again. It does not save your setting as evidenced by no ~/.XHkeys being created.

Expected Results:  
xhkconf should have created an empty ~/.XHkeys configuration file on first load to save settings too.
