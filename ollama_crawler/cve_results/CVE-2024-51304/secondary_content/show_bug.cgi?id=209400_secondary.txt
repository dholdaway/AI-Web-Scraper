Description

Ever since upgrading to xorg-series 1.4* (which version is unimportant, they all react equally), Full screen sdl games would have mouse problems. In example, the mouse wouldn't stay in the center of the screen and would pull to one side. Downgrading to xorg 7.2 with the 1.3 server with no other changes solves the issue immediately.  What I've needed to do is start sdl agmes in a terminal with export SDL_VIDEO_X11_DGAMOUSE=0 . The libsdl ebuild did not have a use flag built into the ebuild for a defaultly enabled configure option  --enable-video-x11-dgamouse
use X11 DGA for mouse events [default=yes]
For the time being I have created an ebuild with the added use flag so that anyone having problems can use it and disable the problematic dgamouse extension but this is not the answer, the true fix must be found.


Reproducible: Always

If you are having problems like this emerge libsdl with 
media-libs/libsdl -video-x11-dgamouse
in /etc/portage/package.use

no idea what this ebuild is supposed to show.  please post diffs, not entire files.

The modification is the inclusion of a new use flag video-x11-dgamouse. It is in the configure options of the sdl package but the libsdl ebuild in the portage tree doesn't allow for disabling it. There are some people who are experiencing mouse problems because of the dgamouse extension with xorg-server 1.4. This enables you to build libsdl with dgamouse disabled.

I encountered a remarkably similar problem about the time when I upgraded xf86-input-evdev to 1.2.0. Are the poeple with this problem using evdev?

Anyway, the short-term fix I used is to place this in my xorg.conf:

Section "Module"
	SubSection "extmod"
              Option  "omit XFree86-DGA"
        EndSubSection
EndSection

That worked for me, but I'm still not sure exactly what caused this problem in the first place.

When  I  get  a  chance  I  will  test  to  see  if  that  will  change  anything.  But  Im  not  using  evdev.  Not  for  my  mouse.

Your xorg entry solves problem. Seems easier than new ebuild so thats the better fix,  but  still,  why  is  it  that we need to do this?
