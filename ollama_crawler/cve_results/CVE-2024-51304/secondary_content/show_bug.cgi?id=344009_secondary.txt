$ du -hs files/
216K    files/
$ ls files/ | wc -l
38

This is one of the biggest 'files' directories in tree.

$ du -sbh files
141K    files

It's a lot less dramatic if you let du count the actual file size as your block size may differ.

it would probably help if ISC dhcp were brought up to date.  a _lot_ of changes have gone into dhcp since 3.1.3, we're at 4.2.0-p1 now
