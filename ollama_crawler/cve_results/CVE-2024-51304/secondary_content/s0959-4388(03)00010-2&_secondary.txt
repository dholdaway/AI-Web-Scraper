In the dorsal spinal cord, recent advances have begun to define these mechanisms. Eight dorsal interneuron populations have now been classified according to their expression of molecular markers, their projection patterns, neurotransmitter type, and/or function. The ability to identify progenitor cells and neurons in the dorsal spinal cord on the basis of the genes they express has provided a framework for identifying extrinsic factors that establish proliferation rate and dorsal–ventral polarity in the developing neural tube; furthermore, this ability has helped define roles for basic helix–loop–helix and homeodomain transcription factors in neuronal cell-type specification.ElsevierShow moreShow lessSave Cite Cited by 394 Related articles All 10 versions  PrivacyTermsHelpAbout ScholarSearch help
