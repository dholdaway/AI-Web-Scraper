I didn't recognize this before as I already had it installed, but the ebuild needs this dependency.  I removed all dhcp clients installed net-misc/networkmanager and networkmanager will not resolve name servers.

I wrote the http://gentoo-wiki.com/NetworkManager in case anybody thinks I'm full of it. :)

Reproducible: Always

net-misc/dhcdbd (which is the real NM dependency) already depends on it.

I removed dhcp after installing networkmanager thinking net-misc/dhcdbd was a dhcp client.  Ooops.  Re-emerging networkmmanager obviously wouldn't show it needed dhcp.  Appreciate the explaining.
