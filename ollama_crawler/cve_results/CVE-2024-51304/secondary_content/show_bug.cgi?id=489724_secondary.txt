Description


Andreas K. Hüttel







          2013-10-29 09:17:35 UTC
        

Right now I'm using my own box at home to generate libreoffice-bin, and this slows down things because I can't have it running all the time. I'd appreciate very much access to something like this:

* always on, reasonably fast amd64 box with decent memory (8G should be fine)
* reachable with prehistoric means (IPv4)
* main system with stable amd64 installation
* controlled by infra, preferably noone else messing with it
* 50 Gigabyte free disk space for two dedicated build chroots
* root access, at least inside the chroots, dunno if that can be done selectively

Details can be discussed of course...

As for build times, generating the full set of packages takes roughly two days on my i7 920 @ 2.67GHz.
