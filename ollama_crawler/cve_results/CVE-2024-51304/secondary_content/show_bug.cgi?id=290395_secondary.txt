Description


Juergen Rose





          2009-10-24 17:24:40 UTC
        

Starting avogadro I get the following error message in the terminal window:
rose@condor:/home/rose(2)$ avogadro 
"Avogadro version:	1.0.0	Git:	
LibAvogadro version:	1.0.0	Git:	" 
Locale:  "C" 
Libavogadro translations not found. 
Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".

Then a alert box:
   This system does not support OpenGL.

Nvidia opengl is activated:
rose@condor:/home/rose(4)$ eselect opengl list
Available OpenGL implementations:
  [1]   nvidia *
  [2]   xorg-x11

I don't have a /etc/X11/xorg.conf

At a second PC with xorg-x11-opengl I can start avogadro.

Reproducible: Always

The reason for the observed behaviour is perhaps due to the fact, that only the nv x11 driver and not the nvidia driver is loaded, if there is no xorg.conf.

And if only the nv driver is loaded, then nvidia opengl does not work.

This looks like a GL driver issue, rather than a specific Avogadro issue. If GLX issue is missing Avogadro will not work, but should warn you of the problem rather than crashing. Did you check whether the nvidia kernel module had been loaded?

If the GLX extension is missing Avogadro cannot function, nor would any OpenGL application. I am marking this as WORKSFORME.
