For the full fiscal year, our teams grew Adjusted EBITDA to $252.8 million and improved Adjusted EBITDA margin by over 200 bps despite a 10.6% reduction in net sales, which demonstrated our strategic focus on automation and operational excellence is working. Our net sales outlook for fiscal year 2025 is for low single digit growth as we look to grow across all channels. We will continue to invest in the business through automation, capacity and digital transformation to operate as one company allowing us to achieve our long-term targets.”Fourth Quarter ResultsNet sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased $27.8 million, or 5.8%, to $453.3 million compared with the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. Net income was $26.8 million ($1.69 per diluted share) compared with $30.1 million ($1.80 per diluted share) in the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased $3.3 million due primarily to a decrease in net sales and the one-time startup costs for our new locations in Hamlet, North Carolina and Monterrey, Mexico. Adjusted EPS per diluted share was $1.70 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with $2.21 in the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased $10.6 million, or 16.2%, to $54.7 million, or 12.1% of net sales, compared to $65.3 million, or 13.6% of net sales, for the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. Fiscal Year ResultsNet sales for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024 decreased 10.6% to $1,847.5 million from the prior fiscal year. Net income for the current fiscal year was $116.2 million ($7.15 per diluted share) compared with net income of $93.7 million ($5.62 per diluted share) for the prior fiscal year. Net income for fiscal 2024 increased primarily due to the result of pricing better matching inflationary pressures and overall increased efficiencies across our existing operating locations. These benefits were partially offset by one time startup costs and inefficiencies driven by our new locations in Hamlet, North Carolina and Monterrey, Mexico, which will continue to ramp up production throughout the calendar year. Adjusted EPS per diluted share was $8.53 for the current fiscal year compared with $7.62 for the prior fiscal year. Adjusted EBITDA for the current fiscal year was $252.8 million, or 13.7% of net sales, compared to $240.4 million, or 11.6% of net sales, for the prior fiscal year.-MORE-The following information was filed by American Woodmark Corp (AMWD) on Thursday, May 23, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.
