After a few seconds of playing, sound and video stop
Issue always reproductible playing french freeTV service (rtsp)
The stream is mpeg2 encoded, don't have any other service to test if this is only freetv related

Reproducible: Always

There is that in the ebuild:
If you are upgrading from a version prior to live-2008.02.08
Please make sure to rebuild applications built against live
like vlc or mplayer. live may have had ABI changes and live
support might be broken.

Did you try this ?
Here freetv works fine *after* rebuilding.
