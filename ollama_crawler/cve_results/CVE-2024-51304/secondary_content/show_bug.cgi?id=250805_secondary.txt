if x11-libs/qt-core and x11-libs/qt-gui is compiled with USE=glib for event loop amarok will crash when said event loops are run. I've had trouble getting a decent trace on it but I was able to find that it was an event loop it was crashing on and removing glib from my qt build has resolved it. 

Reproducible: Always

if do you have KDE 4..., in adittion to XFCE or not.
In my comps. Amarok 2.0 crashs sometimes, in gentoo, in Mandriva, in Sabayon, principally under KDE 4...
seems to meu that amarok 2.0 is somewhat unstable or bugged.
previous versions works well

1) Please post your `emerge --info'.
2) Explain how to reproduce the problem.
3) Attach relevant logs (.xsession-errors for instance).
4) Please explain as well what a "crash" means in this case. Does it
   segfault? Is it killed? Can you analyse a core dump with gdb?

and yes amarok 2 is severely unstable. sorry don't have it built with that flag anymore. just building it with qt glib enabled should reproduce. seemed to happen frequently, every minute or so. I'm still having other crashes though and they all started when I changed that flag. so I'm rebuilding a chroot without it. if you can't reproduce, feel free to mark worksforme.

I have amarok-2.0.2 working here and qt build with the glib use flag.
I'm closing this bug as WORKSFORME. I'll add 2.0.2 in a few minutes to the tree.

[ebuild   R   ] x11-libs/qt-core-4.5.0  USE="glib iconv qt3support ssl -custom-cxxflags -debug -doc -pch" 0 kB
[ebuild   R   ] x11-libs/qt-gui-4.5.0  USE="accessibility cups dbus glib gtkstyle mng qt3support -custom-cxxflags -debug -nas -nis -pch -raster -tiff -xinerama" 0 kB
