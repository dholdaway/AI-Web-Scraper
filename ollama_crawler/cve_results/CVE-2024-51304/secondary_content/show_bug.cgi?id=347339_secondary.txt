Description

On a screen resolution of 1024x768, kdenlive is shifted by nearly 200 pixels from the left side of the screen, this zone leaves a space where the desktop can be seen, and the right side of the window overflows the right size. After resizing the window on the left border, the right border stays out of the right side and it's impossible to seen the whole window.

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
The whole kdenlive window can be seen on a screen of 1024x768.

Version 0.8 of kdenlive allows to close widgets. Without some widgets, the layout fit in a 1024x768 screen. Thanks.
