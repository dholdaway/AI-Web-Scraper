System -> Administration -> Login Window settings are not saving at first time.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open System -> Administration -> Login Window -> Local tab in first time I see an option "Theme" is set to "Selected only".
2. Select an another theme from a list below and click "OK" button.
3. And then, if I open this settings window again I can see option "Theme" setted to "Random from selected".
Actual Results:  
After opening this settings window I can see option "Theme" is set to "Random from selected" O.o

Expected Results:  
"Selected only" value in "Theme" option

After setting back "Theme" parameter to "Selected only" and click "OK" the problem disappears.

It is not a single incident. I have it every time I reinstall my system.

Sorry for my bad English :)

this is a known issue of gdmsetup and there is near 0 chances it'll ever be fixed because upstream considers =<2.20 dead and unmaintenable.
