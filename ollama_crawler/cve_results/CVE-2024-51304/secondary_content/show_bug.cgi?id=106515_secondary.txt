Description

Now that the new metastructure is in place, projects can be easily created by
creating the appropriate ProjectXML page under /proj in CVS. The Project list,
however, is not automatically generated from CVS contents but must be edited in
place. This bug tracks the changes that need to be done on the
gentoo/xml/htdocs/proj/en/metastructure/gentoo.xml page to make its contents a
little more current with what we have now.

Phase 1: Get rid of the old gentoo.xml contents
The page contains the list of the old managers and should be cleaned up, so that
it just contains the projects list.

Phase 2: Remove deprecated projects
The "tools" project is deprecated, its project page is empty.

Phase 3: Remove the ugly "other" project and promote its subproject(s)
The "other" TLP is an empty umbrella project created to cover eselect, it has no
reasons to exist in the new metastructure. eselect should be directly listed at
the root level.

Phase 4: Ask newly-created projects if/where they want to appear
The following projects have been created since the new metastructure is in place
but don't appear in the project list because they are not in gentoo.xml. We
should ask their lead if they want to appear and fix this :
- forums
- apache
- dotnet
When it's done we should warn everyone that to create a project and make it
appear they need to create the page *and* edit gentoo.xml.

Phase 5: Ombudsman should no longer be under devrel
The Ombudsman is a separate project and does not depend on devrel (and should
not appear to depend from it) so it should be listed at root level. Listing it
directly in gentoo.xml and remove it from the devrel page should fix this.

Phase 6: the council project page
Proper council pages should be created (there already is a directory to hold
meeting logs) to list council members, slacker marks etc... Some projects might
be added as subprojects of the council (if everyone agrees):
- devrel/manager-meetings (the old managers meetings)
- glep

Phase 7: Subprojects of umbrella TLPs might want promotion
Large projects like base or desktop have several subprojects that might just
want to be listed at root level (arch teams come to mind). We should ask them
where they want to appear

I agree with the points. Perhaps we should also remove the old project listing
link from the project listing page. Also note that relocation of projects takes
two edits. One in the old parent, and one in the new parent. On adding projects
to the list. The idea originally was to have people request is as that ensures
that the pages are ready to be in the list.

I've taken care of updating gentoo.xml to take items 1 to 3 into account.

OK, phases 1 to 3 have been done thanks to Paul.

Ccing leads from the apache/forums/dotnet projects for phase 4 :
You all created project pages that don't appear in the main project list at :
http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/index.xml
Do you want to be listed at top-level ?

Oops. Seems we weren't exactly aware of the procedure at that time.

> Do you want to be listed at top-level ?
This seems to be the best place, so unless someone comes up with a better idea:
Yes please.

Done. 

I didn't realize we should add that ourselves. I was under the erroneous
impression that it was auto-updating by scanning the /proj/en dir for some
reason. That's what I get for assuming instead of looking at the code or asking
someone.

metastructure, please fix :-)

I've taken care of phase 6, the council page should appear soon.

http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/index.xml?showlevel=1 is the current listing of gentoo projects.
it has a link to http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/metastructure/oldprojects.xml which is describes
as "The old static unmaintained version of the document". that page was last Updated 19 Jul 2003
and should now be removed from the site.

a 302 redirect from the old page to the new would be nice. thanks.

Reassigning to infra-bugs, not sure who handles this page dynamic updater.

Reassigning to neysx since he deals more with xml and the site itself. Also
adding swift for his input.

No one, there is no such thing as "this page dynamic updater."

Exactly.
Any new project can be added by any gentoo dev when and if the project is to be listed.
I don't think any kind of auto-update would be sensible.
