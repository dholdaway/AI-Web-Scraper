Squid ebuild doesn't support --enable-storeio-null which enables you to disable disk caching (disk caching is inefficient on a one hd setup and it is always better to disable it)

Reproducible: Always

I don't see what are you complaining about? How does is NOT support it?

<snip>
if use elibc_uclibc; then
	myconf="${myconf} --enable-storeio=ufs,diskd,aufs,null"
	myconf="${myconf} --disable-async-io"
else
	myconf="${myconf} --enable-storeio=ufs,diskd,coss,aufs,null"
	myconf="${myconf} --enable-async-io"
fi
</snip>
