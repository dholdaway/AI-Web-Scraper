Although my setup right now is a very tricky one that is not supported, I suppose the same would happen on Gentoo/FreeBSD where bsdtar is the default provider of the tar command.

With /bin/tar symlinked to /bin/bsdtar, openoffice fails in this way:

[I suppose it's related to gnome USE flag too at this point.]

Although bsdtar has not a 100% GNU tar compatible interface it comes near enough and we decided before we'd be supporting as much as possible POSIX tar options rather than GNU extensions.

Also, I'm not sure why it's building stuff for slackware...

Thanks,
Diego

Hmm, are you still getting this with 3.0?

Doesn't look like so…
