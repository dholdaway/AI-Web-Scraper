hello,
th actual version of asterix on gentoo can't make outgoing calls to gmx voip because it user as auth uri the called number and not the username.

i will try some other versions of asterisk.

Proxy-Authorization: Digest username="username", realm="sip-gmx.net", algorithm=MD5, uri="sip:called number@sip-gmx.net", nonce="WmUd3lplHLJqsUPUOKrDl9EGiSz1YgB7", response="49a41eabf5fa21e40d6ce44e40e24fd1"

but the username must be used in uri.

goodby

Asterisk is doing as it is told, you should be updating your configuration. Because most postings about Schlund, 1&1 & GMX on the internet are encrypted I cannot easily help you.

hallo,
it is impossible to config asterisk to use the callerid instead of the called nummer for authentication.

if i call a nummer from the same account with the same password, it works, but if i call a number from other user or with other pwassword, it don't work.

asterisk do not this, what stands in the documentation for sip authentication on invite and this makes problems.

goodby
