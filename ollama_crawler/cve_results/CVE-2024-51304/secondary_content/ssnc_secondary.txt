 Inside Ssc Technologies Holdings Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment’s current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future, which could have a material effect on our financial position.



 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
Ongoing macroeconomic conditions, such as increases in interest rates and inflation rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates, could have impacts on our results that are uncertain and, in many respects, outside our control.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Economic conditions are subject to rapid and possibly material change, which ultimately could result in material negative effects on our business and results of operations.

 Financial - Debt   Highlight
In addition, under the Credit Agreement, certain defaults under agreements governing other material indebtedness could result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement, in which case the lenders could elect to accelerate payments under the Credit Agreement and terminate any commitments they have to provide future borrowings.
