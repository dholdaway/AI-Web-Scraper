 Inside Dine Brands Global, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
An increase in discount rates, a reduction in projected cash flows or a combination of the two could lead to a reduction in the estimated fair values, which may result in impairment charges that could materially affect our financial statements in any given year.



 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
This could reduce the profitability of franchise restaurants, potentially impacting the ability of franchisees to make royalty payments owed to us when due, which could adversely impact our current cash flow from franchise operations, and negatively impacting franchisees’ ability to develop new restaurants, which could adversely impact our future cash flows from franchise operations.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
Thus, our rental income also could be adversely affected due to our obligation to make rental or other payments for such properties.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
There are numerous potential events that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the forecast of system-wide sales, including a decrease in customers' disposable income available for discretionary spending or a decrease in the perceived wealth of customers, as well as unexpected events such as a global pandemic.

 Other - Other   Highlight
