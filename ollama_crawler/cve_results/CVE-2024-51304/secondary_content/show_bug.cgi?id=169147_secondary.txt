Description

everyone has /usr/bin/ in their path.  few people have /opt/bin/ in their path.  I think only acrobat actually uses this path.

this leads seamonkey-bin and firefox-bin to complain that acrobat 7 is not in the path.  may I suggest that the install script simply add a

  ln -s /opt/bin/acroread /usr/bin/

regards,

/iaw

Reproducible: Always

/opt/bin is added to $PATH by /etc/env.d/00basic already (installed by baselayout).
