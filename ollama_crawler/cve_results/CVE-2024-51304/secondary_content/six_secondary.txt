Exhibit 99.1Contact:Evan BertrandVice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer+1-972-595-5180investorrelations@sftp.comSix Flags Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 PerformanceARLINGTON, Texas — February 29, 2024 — Six Flags Entertainment Corporation (NYSE: SIX), the world’s largest regional theme park company and the largest operator of water parks in North America, today reported fourth quarter Revenue of $293 million, Net Loss of $22 million, and Adjusted EBITDA(1) of $98 million. For the full year, the company reported revenue of $1,426 million, Net Income of $39 million, and Adjusted EBITDA(1) of $462 million."As we close out our second year pursuing our premiumization strategy, we are encouraged by the progress we have made to date. Since 2021, we have grown guest spending per capita by 17%, lowered cash expense in the face of historical levels of inflation, leveraged key partnerships to expand sponsorship revenue, and paid down debt," said Selim Bassoul, President and CEO. “Looking ahead to 2024, we have seen early success in sales of our 2024 passes, which are ahead of last year, and should provide a solid foundation as we head into the core operating season. We have laid the groundwork long-term for profitable growth, and we have many exciting new developments in store for the 2024 season, including new innovative rides, immersive experiences, and new guest-facing technological innovations that will create a more seamless in-park experience, drive guest spending and improve operational efficiency.”  Fourth Quarter 2023 ResultsThree Months Ended(Amounts in millions, except per share data)December 31, 2023January 1, 2023% Change vs. 2022Total revenue$293 $280 5 %Net (loss) income attributable to Six Flags Entertainment (2)$(22)$10 N/MNet (loss) income per share, diluted (2)$(0.27)$0.12 N/MAdjusted EBITDA (1) , (3)$98 $99 — %Attendance4.34.16 %Spending per capita figures: (4)Total guest spending per capita$64.19 $65.15 (1)%Admissions spending per capita$33.06 $34.50 (4)%In-park spending per capita$31.13 $30.65 2 %Total revenue for fourth quarter 2023 increased $13 million, or 5%, compared to fourth quarter 2022, driven by higher attendance, partially offset by lower guest spending per capita. The increase in attendance was driven both by higher season pass and single-day ticket attendance during the Fall events line-up versus the prior year.The $0.96 decrease in guest spending per capita compared to fourth quarter 2022 consisted of a $1.44 decrease in admissions spending per capita and a $0.48 increase in In-park spending per capita. The decrease in guest spending per capita was driven by lower revenue from memberships beyond the initial 12-month commitment period, which is recognized evenly each month. Due to discontinuing the sale of new memberships in the prior year, there were fewer memberships in fourth quarter 2023 versus fourth quarter 2022. Lower membership revenue, which includes a portion of revenue allocated to Park food, merchandise, and other, decreased admissions spending per capita by $2.48, and in-park spending per capita by $0.84, when compared to the prior year fourth quarter. This was partially offset by higher average ticket pricing and higher spend on food and beverage and attractions in fourth quarter 2023 versus prior year.The company had a net loss of $22 million in fourth quarter 2023, compared to net income of $10 million in fourth quarter 2022. The loss per share was $0.27 compared to income per share of $0.12 in fourth quarter 2022, driven by $15 million in merger-related transaction costs and higher cash operating costs(5) in fourth quarter 2023 versus the prior year, partially offset by an increase in revenue. The increase in cash operating costs was driven by higher variable costs associated with higher attendance, higher investments in new entertainment events and digital guest-facing innovations, and inflationary impacts on operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes $15 million in merger-related transaction costs, was $98 million, essentially flat compared to fourth quarter 2022.The following information was filed by Six Flags Entertainment Corp (SIX) on Thursday, February 29, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.
