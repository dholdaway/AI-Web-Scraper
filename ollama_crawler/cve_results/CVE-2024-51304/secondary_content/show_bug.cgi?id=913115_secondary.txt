Live iso doesn't seem to have support for btrfs-progs. Which is necessary for installing a system in subvol.

Please give the precise ISO filename you used.

As far as I can tell, it should be in there:
```
$ rg btrfs-progs
releases/specs/x86/hardened/admincd-stage1-openrc.spec:172:     sys-fs/btrfs-progs
releases/specs/sparc/sparc64/installcd-stage1.spec:73:# sys-fs/btrfs-progs
releases/specs/x86/i486/installcd-stage1-openrc.spec:81:        sys-fs/btrfs-progs
releases/specs/ppc/ppc32/installcd-stage1.spec:66:      sys-fs/btrfs-progs
releases/specs/amd64/installcd-stage1.spec:82:  sys-fs/btrfs-progs
releases/specs/amd64/livegui/livegui-stage1.spec:228:   sys-fs/btrfs-progs
releases/specs/amd64/hardened/admincd-stage1.spec:173:  sys-fs/btrfs-progs
releases/specs/arm64/installcd-stage1.spec:84:  sys-fs/btrfs-progs

I can confirm it's available in latest version.

Sorry I made a mistake on my side.
