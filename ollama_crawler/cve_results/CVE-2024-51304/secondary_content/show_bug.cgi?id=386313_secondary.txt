CVE-2010-4756 (http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2010-4756):
  The glob implementation in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) allows
  remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (CPU and memory
  consumption) via crafted glob expressions that do not match any pathnames,
  as demonstrated by glob expressions in STAT commands to an FTP daemon, a
  different vulnerability than CVE-2010-2632.

Agreed.  Nothing toolchain is going to do on this one.
