 Inside Ies Holdings, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
Additionally, gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2023 was positively impacted by an increase in revenues from our generator enclosure business as discussed above, as well as improved operating margins in our custom power solutions business.



 Revenue - Product   Highlight
The benefit of improved project execution in 2023 was partially offset by the sale of STR in October 2022, which contributed gross profit of $4.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2022.

 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
The increase in operating cash flow resulted primarily from increased earnings and a reduction in cash used in working capital during the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to the year ended September 30, 2022 Operating activities provided net cash of $16.3 million during the year ended September 30, 2022, as compared to $37.9 million of net cash provided in the year ended September 30, 2021.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Changes in job performance, job conditions, estimated contract costs, profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income, and the effects of such revisions are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
The increase in gross profit was driven primarily by contributions from the businesses acquired in fiscal 2021 and higher volumes, partly offset by increased commodity prices.
