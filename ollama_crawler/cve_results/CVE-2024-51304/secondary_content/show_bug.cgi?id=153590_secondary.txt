Is there any reason not to update the krb4 USE flag dependency in net-misc/curl to use virtual/krb5 instead of app-crypt/kth-krb?

I have heard rumours that no one is maintaining kth-krb.

That's what USE=kerberos is for in there...

Yeah, I guess, but I looked at a couple of other ebuilds that have the krb4 flag, and they depend for it on virtual/krb5, or directly on mit-krb5.

Can you try a test for me?

(Remove any ~arch or -* keywords from kth-krb, so the stable ebuild gets built)
emerge -C kth-krb
emerge -v1 curl

And, of course, put krb4 in the USE flags for curl.
