Description

During boot process clamd was started using default config:

START_CLAMD=yes
START_FRESHCLAM=yes

I decided to change these values to:

START_CLAMD=no
START_FRESHCLAM=yes

and restarted /etc/init.d/clamd. The effect is, that freshclam is restarted, whereas clamd is untouched and therefor still running. But the intention of this change is that clamd should not run.

How about that you stop clamd first? I don't see any bug here, the variable purpose is to check whether it should be started, and not to stop it if you already started it.

Ok, under this assumption it isn't a bug.
