This package does not support Python 3.10. Please test it with Python 3.10 as a matter of urgency as the default will change in early June, as per message on gentoo-dev: https://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-dev/message/13aa993921f19b6b095297721ffb0d0b. Ask in #gentoo-python on IRC if need any help.

$ pkgcheck scan -k PythonCompatUpdate sci-physics/root
sci-physics/root
  PythonCompatUpdate: version 6.24.06-r2: PYTHON_COMPAT update available: python3_10

The first upstream version that supports Python 3.10 is ROOT 6.26. I think that there is nothing to be done for this bug, 6.26 is already marked as compatible with 3.10.

We could drop 6.24 if really  necessary, but I'd rather leave it in the tree for longer, as users do appreciate being able to use older versions.

I think that's okay, thanks for the reply!
