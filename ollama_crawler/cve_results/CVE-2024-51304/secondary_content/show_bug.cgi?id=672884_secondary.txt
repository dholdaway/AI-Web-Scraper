Description

I have dev-lang/rust-bin-1.29.1-r1 stable and dev-util/cargo-0.30.0 stable installed. along with virtual/rust-1.29.1 and virtual-cargo-1.29.1.  In this environment I attempted to update x11-terms/alacritty-0.2.3 to 0.2.4, only to find that the compile fails because 0.2.4 uses unstable features.  So I attempted to update to dev-lang/rust-bin-1.31.0 unstable, virtual/rust-1.31.0, and virtual/cargo-1.31.0.

Contrary to expectation, this attempted update removed dev-util/cargo-0.30.0 and did not replace it with anything.  When I downgraded dev-lang/rust-bin, virtual/rust, and virtual/cargo back to 1.29.1, portage reinstalled dev-util/cargo-0.30.0 as a new package.

The updated rust or rust-bin package will provide cargo, that is why rust satisfies that virtual, and the standalone cargo is auto-removed.

So in that case, can you shed any light on why attempting to compile alacritty-0.2.4 after the update fails with an error message that cargo was not found?

Check out the first few comments of 671182, I think it might shed some light on your issues

Ben,
Fixing the cargo symlink per 671182 resolved the problem.  Thanks.
