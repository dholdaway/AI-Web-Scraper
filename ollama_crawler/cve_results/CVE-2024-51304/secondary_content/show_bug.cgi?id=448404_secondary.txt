Change mounts removable according to DE, i.e
kde mount to /media
xfce mount to /run/media/$user
gnome mount to /run/media/$user

It's very strange and confused more users, contrary to standard FHS and added in tree wothout any news or warnings. 
In my opinion, these changes must be at least documented,but rather to prevent the bundle distribution consistency.

P.S It is also possible that it broke more selinux-policy package

It's not 'according to DE'.
udisks2 mounts to /run/media/$user.
IIRC, udisks:0 still mounts to /media.

Rafał is correct.

Emerge kde-base/kdelibs with USE="udisks2" and you should get your desired behaviour.
