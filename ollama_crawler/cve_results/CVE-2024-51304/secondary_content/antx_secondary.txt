Exhibit 99.1 
AN2 Therapeutics Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results and Recent Business and Scientific Highlights
Phase 2/3 trial (EBO-301) in treatment-refractory Mycobacterium avium Complex (TR-MAC) continues with Phase 2 topline results expected in summer 2024 and Phase 3 enrollment pause in place during continued analysis of incoming data; plan to discuss with FDA
 
Cash, cash equivalents and investments of $134.5 million at December 31, 2023
 
Menlo Park, CA – March 28, 2024 – AN2 Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANTX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing treatments for rare, chronic, and serious infectious diseases with high unmet needs, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
“AN2’s cash position remains strong as we advance our innovative boron-based pipeline. Following the recent meeting of the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board, we continue to believe in the potential of epetraborole to become an important component of the backbone therapy for NTM lung disease,” said Eric Easom, Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Patients enrolled in the epetraborole Phase 2/3 trial in treatment refractory lung disease caused by MAC continue to be dosed while new enrollment in the Phase 3 part of the trial remains paused. Patients in the Phase 2 trial have reached the six-month mark, and we plan to report topline results this summer. Analysis of the baseline patient demographics from the trial show a highly complex and refractory patient population, which we plan to discuss with the FDA in the coming months.” 
 
Easom continued, “We are pleased with the momentum across our boron chemistry pipeline. We signed a licensing agreement last fall with the University of Georgia Research Foundation to develop a novel therapy for chronic Chagas disease, which is in late preclinical development and we are also progressing an IV formulation of epetraborole for melioidosis, in addition to advancing other research programs. We believe epetraborole, along with these other promising boron therapy candidates, has the opportunity to help address significant unmet patient need.”
Fourth Quarter & Recent Business Updates:
 
Epetraborole Pivotal Phase 2/3 Clinical Study in TR-MAC Lung Disease. This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is comparing epetraborole plus a background regimen versus placebo plus background regimen in patients with TR-MAC lung disease. In February 2024, the Company announced that it had voluntarily paused Phase 3 enrollment in the seamless Phase 2/3 clinical trial, pending further data review. The voluntary pause was instituted following an analysis of blinded aggregate data from the ongoing Phase 2 study, which showed potentially lower than expected efficacy. The aggregate baseline characteristics reveal patients with complex comorbidities, prolonged NTM lung disease, and high levels of cavitary disease, as well as patients who are refractory to Arikayce, the only FDA-approved drug for refractory NTM caused by MAC, as part of their background regimen. The decision to pause Phase 3 enrollment was not due to safety concerns. While the Phase 3 part of the trial is paused for new enrollment (n=97), the Company is continuing to dose existing patients enrolled in the Phase 2/3 trial under the existing protocol. 
 
The Company plans to provide further details on the epetraborole development strategy after discussion with FDA and continued review of the accumulated blinded data. The Company expects to announce topline data from the Phase 2 part of the trial in summer 2024.
 
Presented New Epetraborole Data at Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) IDWeek 2023 Conference. In October 2023, three poster presentations and two oral presentations were presented at the IDWeek 2023 conference that detailed the potential of epetraborole in treating NTM (nontuberculous mycobacteria) lung disease caused by MAC and Mycobacterium abscessus. The Company also presented data on its melioidosis program.
 
Executed License from University of Georgia Research Foundation to Develop Boron-Containing Product Candidates for Chagas Disease. In October 2023, AN2 announced that it had executed an exclusive license from the

 Inside An2 Therapeutics, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Debt   Highlight
If we incur indebtedness, we could become subject to covenants that would restrict our operations and potentially impair our competitiveness, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.



 Other - Other   Highlight
The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is not specified in the agreements; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.

 Other - Other   Highlight
As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation could be materially different.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Any of the foregoing could significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
