When wxWidgets is compiled to use std::list as wxList instead of its own
implementation, wxPython doesn't compile. The attached patch corrects this. At
least xrced works well, more testing is welcome.

Reproducible: Always

If you still have problems w/ x11-libs/wxGTK-2.6.3.3, then file a new bug. Thanks.
