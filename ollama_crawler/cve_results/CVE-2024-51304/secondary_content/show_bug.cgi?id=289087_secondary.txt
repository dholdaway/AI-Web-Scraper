My apologies, I was intending to attach the scons.conf, but there is no file of that name at the location reported by the ebuild.

Stable version is 2.49a. 

Why are you emerging 2.48a-r3? Which version ffmpeg you have installed? This is happening because of too new one.

I guess we should remove 2.48a-r3 from tree.

Pilot error, thanks for pointing it out.  For some reason that I can't recall, I had previously masked 2.49a in my /etc/portage/package.mask, and didn't notice it in the eix output right in front of my face.  This issue does not present itself with 2.49a and it builds successfully for me.

Thanks for the help, and my apologies for the unnecessary distraction.
