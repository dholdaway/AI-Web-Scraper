I tried to install gnome-screenshot on top of gnome-light, only to find out that there are no versions available that depend on pre gnome-3 libraries.

Since gnome-3 is itself ~arch'ed, I think it would be a good idea to readd a pre-gnome-2 version of gnome-screenshot so that I'm not forced to make a big upgrade.

There has never been a gnome-2 version:

*gnome-screenshot-3.4.1 (05 May 2012)
  
  05 May 2012; Alexandre Rostovtsev <tetromino@gentoo.org>
  +gnome-screenshot-3.4.1.ebuild, +metadata.xml:
  New separate gnome screenshot package, formerly part of
  gnome-extra/gnome-utils.

So you should be installing =gnome-extra/gnome-utils-2* with that. =gnome-base/gnome-2* has that in RDEPEND, but then again, gnome-base/gnome-light is supposed to be lightweight...
