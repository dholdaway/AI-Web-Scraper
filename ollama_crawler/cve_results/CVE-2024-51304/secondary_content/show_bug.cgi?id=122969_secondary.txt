Description


Rasmus Wiman





          2006-02-15 15:07:17 UTC
        

The mozilla plugin in the jdk and the jre cause all gecko-based browsers to crash upon loading an applet. The erroe message is:

Error: could not find libjavaplugin_oji.so
Plugin: can't find plugins/../java directory
INTERNAL ERROR on Browser End: Could not start JavaVM! 

Upgrading to 1.4.2.04 makes no difference, but downgrading to 1.4.2 makes the problem go away. I have not dared trying 1.5.0.

A quick google on the problem reveals some discussion on the IBM forums. The problem is said to be due to LIBPATH not being set correctly.

Problem reproduced on tho machines.

Maybe I should add that the error message I posted comes from Firefox-1.0.7-r4, but I expect Mozilla and Epiphany to say similar things, since they all crash.

I also have made sure I didn't forget java-config -S ibm-jre-bin-1.4.2.03 and that stuff.

Is this still a problem with 1.4.2.6 or 1.4.2.7?

No response, gonna close then. IBM JDK 1.4.2.7 and firefox 2.0.0.3 work fine here. Please reopen if it's still an issue.
