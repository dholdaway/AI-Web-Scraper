Description

I installed today for the first time open-iscsi on a server to attach a new NAS.

The newest Version 2.0.872-r2 does not have a dependecy on "libiscsi" but it's need to run the iscsid deamon:

# /etc/init.d/iscsid start
 * Checking open-iSCSI configuration ...
 * Loading iSCSI modules ...
 * Loading libiscsi: not found ...                                 [ !! ]
 * ERROR: iscsid failed to start

Is there a way to use open-iscsi without libiscsi? Maybe there should be at least an enote in the ebuild.

I got the error totally wrong.

I was missing a kernel module, not the libiscsi package.

Never the less, I think the ebuild should check for that module and then throw a message to notify the user.

I am also planing to write an article in the wiki. Maybe with some good documentation, this bug can also be ignored.

Which kernel module was missing? The ebuild in question already checks for SCSI_ISCSI_ATTRS and ISCSI_TC ...

You are right, there was a warning and I missed it :-O

Sorry, for that, didn't see the check when I looked into the ebuild either..
