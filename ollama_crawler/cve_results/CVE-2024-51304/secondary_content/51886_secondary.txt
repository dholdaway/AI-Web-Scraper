This reverts commit 2abee30, reversing changes made to e34a0ee.
A warning on each method is excessive and the warning should already be covered under the guide: https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_callbacks.html#transaction-callbacks

Using both after_create_commit and after_update_commit with the same method name will only allow the last callback defined to take effect, as they both internally alias to after_commit which overrides previously defined callbacks with the same method name.

I don't think I really like this as it is now. I see that this is documented in the guides but when I look at api docs I'm specifically not looking at those.
If a warning for each is too much, would it not be ok to keep the top-level notice only?

@Earlopain If you want to open a PR to add a note at the top-level in the spirit of the guides (e.g. after_*_commit), please do.
