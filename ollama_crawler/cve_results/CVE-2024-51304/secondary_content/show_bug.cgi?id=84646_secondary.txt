The Internet Communications Engine (Ice) is a modern alternative to object middleware such as CORBA or COM/DCOM/COM+. Ice is easy to learn, yet provides a powerful network infrastructure for demanding technical applications. Ice shines where technologies such as SOAP or XML-RPC are too slow, or do not provide sufficient scalability or security. For a comparison between Ice and CORBA, please see http://zeroc.com/iceVsCorba.html. 
 
Ice is free software, available with full source, and released under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). Commercial licenses are available for customers who wish to use Ice for closed-source software.
