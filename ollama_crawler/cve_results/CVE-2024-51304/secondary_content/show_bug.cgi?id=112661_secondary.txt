Description

This is not a bug - I followed this link from 
http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/index.xml, the last paragraph on the 
page, "I disagree with..."  Well, I disagree with the decision to include only 
stage3 instructions in the Gentoo Handbook.  All 6 of my Gentoo boxen have 
built exceptionally well from stage1 and any problems I encountered had simple 
solutions that were mainly due to user error and not difficulty understanding 
the Handbook.  I understand that the Handbook was simplified to stage3 only to 
stem the flow of begreports arising from people not reading the fine manual 
when performing non-stage3 builds, but I think that a link should be put up to 
the old handbook so all of us veteran Gentoo sysadmins can read it from time 
to time when we burn our new LiveCDs.  I don't ever plan on doing a stage3 
Gentoo install as I think it's a waste of time to REbuild the system after the 
initial install.  Thanks for listening to me and I hope that you take this 
into consideration.   

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/index.xml 
2.Read the Handbook 
3. 
 
Actual Results:  
Gentoo Linux (finest OS on the planet) was built successfully with default 
optimization flags for a generic x86 CPU 

Expected Results:  
Built Gentoo Linux using a stage1 image that provided the option to bootstrap 
gcc and build the system with custom-tweaked optimization flags from the 
ground-up, thus saving us all time as we can let the machines bootstrap 
overnight 

Target box (system I WANT to build Gentoo on): Alienware Area51 Custom, Intel 
Pentium4 at 2.4GHz, 768MB PC800 RDRAM, using LiveCD 2005.0 
 
This box (system I used to fill in this form): AMD Athlon-XP at 2.4GHz, 768MB 
PC3200 DDR-SDRAM, running kernel 2.6.13-gentoo-r3, CFLAGS="-O2 
-march=athlon-xp -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer", CHOST="i686-pc-linux-gnu", USE 
Flags summary: optimized for GNOME and KDE, optimized against objective C, 
enabling Java, enabling sse2 FPU optimizations, building with 3d graphics 
libraries, no sound, and a variety of GUI options (aalib, libcaca, Xaw3d, 
lesstif, ncurses, etc.)

bugzilla is not the proper forum for this, please start a thread on the
gentoo-dev mailing list
