Description


blaek burgess





          2008-03-30 11:20:36 UTC
        

the hamachi script located in /etc/init.d/hamachi uses the start-stop-daemon with the following command (to start)

start-stop-daemon --quiet --start -c ${USER}\
   --exec /usr/bin/hamachi -- \
   -c $CONFDIR start &>${LOG} &
   result=$?

the issue is that start-stop-daemon uses the -c flag for its specify user, and  hamachi uses -c for its change config path.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. /etc/init.d/hamachi init
2. /etc/init.d/hamachi start
Actual Results:  
if run without --quiet and without &>${LOG}

hamachi does not seem to be running - have you tried hamachi start?

Expected Results:  
started hamachi correctly

i don't think it's the -c option the problem...the man page of start-stop-daemon states that the arguments after -- are passed unchanged to the program...
so probably that's not the problem...
unfortunately my gentoo machine is down atm, so i can't test anything, but i would guess that it has something to do with hamachi itself...

have you tried to start it manually?...
also check bug #218481(info added to postinst)...

Whatever the problem was, this bug doesn't seem to be applicable anymore and should probably be closed.
