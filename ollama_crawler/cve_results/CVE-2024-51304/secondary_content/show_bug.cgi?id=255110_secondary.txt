ah this one seems new. This shouldn't happen thanks to --disable-schemas-install being passed to configure.

What is the command you use to get enough priviledge to install packages (su, su -, sudo). And could you make sure the ebuild doesn't come from an overlay.

It's a terminal in Konsole, so I presume its su -. The package is not from an overlay.

Do either you somehow have gconf-2.22.0 rather than gconf-2.24.0?

Mysteriously works now. I've moved to a purely Gnome desktop in the meantime, perhaps that's a factor. Closing WORKSFORME on request of Gilles.

Could someon please reopen that bug? I am experiencing the same issue, and it is not resolved for me. I am running a pure GNOME desktop and I also have USE="-tracker" set. For details of my setup see Bug 263264.

Ah, I have gconf-2.24.0 and I am using sudo to gain privileges.

This bug seems to have reappeared with media-video/totem-2.32.0:

VERSION 1.0

R: /etc/gconf/gconf.xml.defaults/.testing.writeability

The USE=-tracker workaround seems to work.

Are you running gnome-overlay?




Comment 13


Henrik Grubbström





          2011-02-27 19:13:08 UTC
        

No, and I run from a fresh su - (which I needed to workaround bug 332139 et al).
