Just out of curiosity, why two slots for the same
major and minor versions of a package?
Why not just replace the other?

dev-haskell/hdbc-sqlite3 package had a complex life. It used to be dev-haskell/hdbc-sqlite:0 -> dev-haskell/hdbc-sqlite:2 0> dev-haskell/hdbc-sqlite:3 -> dev-haskell/hdbc-sqlite3:0.

There used to be a few package moves and slot moves. I suspect it did not go in proper order for you. Removing anythong that is not dev-haskell/hdbc-sqlite3:0
should be fine.
