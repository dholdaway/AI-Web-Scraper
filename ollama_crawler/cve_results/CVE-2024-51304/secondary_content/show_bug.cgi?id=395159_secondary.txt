Portage ebuilds must not install to /usr/local, so you have installed something there on your own. Remove that application and strigi will build.

It seems that ffado and some ffmpeg version have installed something in my /usr/local/lib64 folder.
Following your advice I've uninstalled these programs and deleted the content of that folder.

It solved my problem.

Thank you for your quick answer.
