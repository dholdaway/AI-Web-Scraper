Well, I don't get the file collisions despite having set collision-protect.

Tell me this is what we're looking at here


archtester xen-tools # qlist sys-kernel/linux-headers |grep xen
/usr/include/xen/evtchn.h
/usr/include/xen/privcmd.h

The 'list' is the total of all $(qlist xen-tools)

Take 2. 

archtester xen-tools # eix xen-tools
[D] app-emulation/xen-tools

Installed versions:  4.2.0-r3

archtester xen-tools # qlist xen-tools | grep evtchn.h
/usr/include/xen/sys/evtchn.h
archtester xen-tools # qlist xen-tools | grep privcmd.h
/usr/include/xen/sys/privcmd.h

/usr/include/xen/evtchn.h
/usr/include/xen/privcmd.h

The files evtchn.h privcmd.h have a counterpart in sys/evtchn.h sys/privcmd.h/
The names are the same but the stat of each are unique.

Leaving the folder /usr/include/xen/ in common.  To me this isn't a file collision instance worthy of declared a bug.  Your take on it?

This isn't reproducible on my other machines so does not block the stabilization. We will investigate later.

Ago are you happy to close this, or have you found a root cause perhaps?
