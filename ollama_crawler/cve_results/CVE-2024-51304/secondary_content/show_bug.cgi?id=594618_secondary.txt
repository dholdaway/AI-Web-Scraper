Chromium-55 (possibly 54 too) seems to be integrating with kwallet and asking for it's password on startup

Would be great to have the option to disable this - as I don't use kwallet

I'm guessing it'll be something on the lines off:

IUSE="cups +gn gnome gnome-keyring gtk3 +hangouts kerberos kwallet neon pic +proprietary-codecs pulseaudio selinux +suid +system-ffmpeg +tcmalloc widevine"

kwallet? ( || 
kde-frameworks/kwallet
kde-apps/kwalletd )

myconf_gn+=" use_kwallet=$(usex kwallet true false)"

It's not an "automagic dependency"; that term specifically refers to build-time dependencies that get auto-detected during the build process.

You can disable kwallet at runtime using the --password-store switch.
