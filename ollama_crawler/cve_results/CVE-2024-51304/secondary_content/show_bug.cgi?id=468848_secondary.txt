Description


Sergey S. Starikoff





          2013-05-07 10:18:37 UTC
        

Referred from http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/list.xml?desc=1 link
http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/xfce-config.xml gives 500 Internal Server Error instead of expected page.
All other tested links from page (listed below) are displayed correctly.

Also:
The GNOME Configuration HOWTO
The Fluxbox Configuration HOWTO
The Xfce Configuration Guide
The Openbox Configuration HOWTO
The LXDE Configuration HOWTO

I think, it will be good to unify article names, renaming "The Xfce Configuration Guide" to "The Xfce Configuration HOWTO".

I can't reproduce this... perhaps there was a wrong sync or so.

Care to refresh and retry? Also, if it is still prevalent, what is the IP address shown for www.gentoo.org?
