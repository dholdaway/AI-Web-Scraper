Using cinnamon-2.6.8 , in cinnamon-settings -> keyboard, changing key repeat speed or delay have no effect.

Changing via gsettings org.cinnamon.settings-daemon.peripherals.keyboard repeat-interval and org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.keyboard repeat-interval have no effect either.

I'm not sure how to debug. Any ideas what could be wrong?

Do you get any error when launching the control center from a terminal?

Well, now it is working though I can't explain why because I have not updated anything since yesterday, have not rebooted, don't think I changed anything relevant. Anyway, you could just close this bug.

But in case you are still interested, I do get some errors running cinnamon-settings. See the following startup messages, and (where it says "Loading keyboard module") additional errors in keyboard settings module:

The warnings should be reported directly to upstream and that errors are because of the optional USE flags for optional features
