Description


Marcin Szamotulski





          2010-12-03 09:50:27 UTC
        

After fresh install of texlive-2010, the command:
mktexpk --mfmode / --bdpi 600 --mag 1+300/600 --dpi 900 t1-yvtbi
fails:
mktexpk: don't know how to create bitmap font for t1-yvtbi.
mktexpk: perhaps t1-yvtbi is missing from the map file.

However if I run it as root, it works.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.emerge texlive-2010
2.run (not as root) mktexpk --mfmode / --bdpi 600 --mag 1+300/600 --dpi 900 t1-yvtbi

Sorry, I needed texlive to work and I have installed not from portage. Here is the emerge --info texlive (I do not know if it is relevant after unmerging the texlive. I didn't changed any use flags, though, I just added entries in package.provided file).

Best, Marcin

Does the problem you describe occur with the texlive installed from portage or with an installation you did by yourself without using portage (or any other package manager)?

Could you please provide the output of 'emerge -pv' then?

Note that the version of tex that I use now is my local version not the portage one.

well, your output is indeed the one from the local version you installed
it's not useful at all :(

closing as worksforme, please reopen if you're able to reproduce the failure with the portage version, there's really nothing I can do if you cannot help by testing it.

Unfortunatelly, I do not have time now for trying the portage version, but I will keep this in mind. Thanks.
