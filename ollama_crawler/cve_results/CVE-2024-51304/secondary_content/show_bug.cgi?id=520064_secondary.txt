1) It has mail:root instead of root:mail
2) the group is not writeable, therefore a common user gets an error the the lock file could not be created in /var/spool/mail


tested yesterday with a stage 3 build and sendmail 8.14.9

I downloaded that stage3 tarball just now and it doesn't in fact install /var/spool/mail at all - that should be singularly owned by net-mail/mailbase. The mailbase ebuilds invariably call `fowners root:mail /var/spool/mail'.

Hhm,

I installed a KVM following strictly the handbook.
Then I emerged mailx and  sendmail (well, not with USE flag mbox, I forgot it), so I rebuilt all with that USE flag.
Now I made the first usual tests (still in chroot, KVM was not booted the first time with its own kernel):

I run "date | mail -s fromR tfoerste" as root and "date | mail -s fromT root" where tfoerste is the unprivileged user to check mail sending itself and run as every user "mail" to see, if I can read the mail and delete it.

That's why I stumbled over this issue.
