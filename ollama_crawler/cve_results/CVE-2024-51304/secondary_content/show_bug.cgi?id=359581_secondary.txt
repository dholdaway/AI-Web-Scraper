Not sure what packages are really need the sdk-use-flag?

Thanks

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge -v virtualbox
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
 ~ # emerge -v virtualbox

These are the packages that would be merged, in order:

Serkan, since this is a result of the changes you did to -r1 can you comment on it?

Actually this was causing python or java files not being installed without enabling sdk USE flag as well. So I added a check for it.

Currently sdk USE flag enables native xpcom api; java and python enables relative bindings. So just enabling sdk should work.

Thanks, works with +sdk for app-emulation/virtualbox, i thought the use-flag was needed for a different package :/
