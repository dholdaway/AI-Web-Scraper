Description

Consider a AVI file, with DEMUXER=avi, ID_VIDEO_FORMAT=XVID and ID_AUDIO_FORMAT=85.
For which mplayer usesffmpeg, which itself uses libavcodec, which itself uses “[ffodivx] vfm: ffmpeg (FFmpeg MPEG-4)”, resulting in ID_VIDEO_CODEC=ffodivx.
(And ID_AUDIO_CODEC=mpg123.)

————————————————————————————————————————

Playing it back (using mplayer) with “-lavdopts threads=2” results in a blank/black screen, but otherwise working playback. On the console, it first shows the error message

[VD_FFMPEG] DRI-Versagen. # ← “Versagen” here means failure/malfunction.
[mpeg4 @ 0x7fa24e953d00]get_buffer() failed (stride changed)

and then it floods it with

[mpeg4 @ 0x7fa24e953d00]get_buffer() failed (stride changed)
Error while decoding frame!

————————————————————————————————————————

When doing the same, without the above option, everything works normally.

• This is new, since I didn’t have it before my update on Friday.
• Since I update once a week, on that day, it can only be a bug in a version that was added to portage after 2012-04-06.
• I can reproduce this every time, as long as it’s that file/codec type.
• If you need a video to test this on, I can help with that, if requested.

it works fine here with mplayer-1.1-r1 and recent ffmpeg versions, could you please try if it still fails with current ~arch versions ? and if it does, try e.g. ffmpeg-1.1.2
a lot of multithreading problems have been fixed in the last years
