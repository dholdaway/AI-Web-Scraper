It is fine with normal jpeg-8b. Restricting tests until solved.

Has anyone been in contact with upstream and suggested switching into libjpeg-turbo? 

I'm not sure of the exact problem but this doesn't seem worth fixing without upstream switching too, since upstream is reclutant in switching away from the internal copies and we propably end up unbundling them forever.

Still failing with media-libs/libjpeg-turbo-1.2.1.
Any clue for a fix?

It is still failing, but I guess the test are old.
And they are failing in the same way even without patching.
But the demo work with jpeg
Failing test does not block the test phases, so I will close
