Description

scp in openssh-4.0_p1 can't seem to do any remote copies(in either direction) on two of my ~x86 machines due to an xfree NULL pointer error, to/from a particular host, when that host is configured to set up port forwards.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Configure a host to use port forwarding in ${HOME}/.ssh/config, ie:
Host <hostname>
LocalForward 6769 127.0.0.1:19150
2. Transfer any file to a remote machine or from a remote machine, such as:
scp <host>:file file

Actual Results:  
scp fails before asking for a password for either password-mode or keys with:
xfree: NULL pointer given as argument

Expected Results:  
scp asks for a password for the server or keys and then transfers the file.

This does not appear to occur for local transfers(file-to-file). One machine
observed is a pentium 3 733mhz, the other a P4. Both are using -O2. Problem does
not seem to occur in openssh-3.9_p1-r2. Problem occurs whether a ssh session is
already open (and thus listening on the forwarded port) or not.
