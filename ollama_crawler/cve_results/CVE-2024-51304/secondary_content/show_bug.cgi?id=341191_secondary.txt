Description

media-sound/padevchooser-0.9.3-r1 fails to load on my system with the following error message:
** (padevchooser:14485): WARNING **: pa_browser_new() failed.

According to this website this tool is obsolete anyways:
http://www.pulseaudio.org/wiki/PerfectSetup

I would suggest (hard)masking it.

If one wants to fix the package for the current pulse-audio nevertheless, I will attach my emerge -info in the next post.

Reproducible: Always

Is this removal a bit rash maybe? It works for me with 0.9.21.1 and I really don't see why this one needs to be removed?
