Description

The issue is not repeatable. Crash occurs sometimes when i do something with the file manager window, for example open a directory, point an icon or scroll the view. Sometimes it happens repeatedly in a single place (as opening a specific directory) for a few times, then on another try caja works normally.
I have used version (AFAIR) 1.12 for a few months without problems, then the problem appeared (can't remember doing anything that could trigger it). Upgrading to 1.18.3 did not fix the problem.
I will post more info if needed.

gdb output:
Thread 1 "caja" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

It is sad to read that you have problems with the software. The situation seems to be a bit more complicate and requires some analysis.
We can not help you efficiently via bug tracker. The bug tracker aims rather on specific problems in .ebuilds and less on individual systems. 

I use mate-base/caja-1.18.3 a lot and can not confirm this.
Test the following: 
a) Recompile caja and all dependencies
b) try to use a fresh user profile. Perhaps there was some problem in a broken config?

I have had very good experience on the gentoo IRC [1] with questions like this. Of course there are also forums and mailing lists [2,3].
I hope you understand, that I will close the bug here therefore and wish you good luck on one of the mentioned channels [4].
Please reopen the ticket in order to provide an indication for an specific error in an ebuild or any gentoo related product.
