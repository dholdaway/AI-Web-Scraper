I noticed that open-vm-tools looks for the kernel source directory for compiling its modules. However, it is not registered with module-rebuild.

I suggest to register open-vm-tools with module-rebuild so that open-vm-tools can be easily recompiled on a kernel upgrade.

Reproducible: Always

Maybe I use module-rebuild in a wrong way:
After
$ module-rebuild populate
open-vm-tools is correctly added to module-rebuild's database.

Thanks, I'll look into this.  Linux-mod is being inheritted, so the correct functions should be getting called, but it's possible something else is overriding it...

Well, I've just double checked open-vm-tools, and it definitely added itself to the moduledb.  This issue may also go away given the latest portage will support "emerge @module-rebuild" to do the rebuilding.  Either way, could you please check whether this is still happening or not?

I tried again on a system which never had open-vm-tools installed before, and rebuilding with module-rebuild worked on first try. So unfortunately I cannot reproduce the issue reported by me!

Ok, thanks for testing that.  I'm going to mark this as WORKSFORME then...  5:)
