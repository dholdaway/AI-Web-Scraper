To add the program to the systemtray, it needs the dev-python/egg-python package. But this package is not listed as dependencie.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install nagstamon without having dev-python/egg-python installed
2. start nagstamon

RDEPEND=">=dev-lang/python-2.4
    dev-python/pygtk
    dev-python/lxml
    gnome? ( || ( dev-python/gnome-python-extras dev-python/egg-python ) )"


You need USE="gnome" for that.

I haven't compiled it with gnome support, but I have some gnome-libs installed to use programs like gnucash and gnumeric. May be only some libs are needed, but I don't know what the gnome flag really does which the nagstamon package.
