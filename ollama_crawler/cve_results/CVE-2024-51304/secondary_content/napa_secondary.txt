 Inside Duckhorn Portfolio, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
These estimates and judgments could materially impact the Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, as future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and even the best estimates routinely require adjustment.



 Other - Other   Highlight
The allowances for the depletion-based incentives are reassessed at each reporting date to reflect changes in facts and circumstances that could impact allowance estimates.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings.

 Financial - Debt   Highlight
The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, including delivery of audited financial statements and customary negative covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or to grant certain liens.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Cost of sales for Fiscal 2024 increased $3.2 million, or 1.7%, compared to Fiscal 2023, primarily due to the acquisition of Sonoma-Cutrer driving increased volumes and recognition of step-up cost of goods sold related to acquired inventories, partially offset by lower sales volume contributions in the wholesale and DTC channels, excluding Sonoma-Cutrer, that correspondingly impacted cost of sales.
