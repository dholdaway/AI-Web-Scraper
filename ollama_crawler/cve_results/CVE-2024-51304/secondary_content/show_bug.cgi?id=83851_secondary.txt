I syced up twice today and it won't create a metadata/timestamp.chk file.  This is important to me because other boxes don't like to sync with my local mirror when that file is missing.

Is this just a hiccup?

You can make one if necessary.

We were moving servers around and probably caused a hiccup, yes.
