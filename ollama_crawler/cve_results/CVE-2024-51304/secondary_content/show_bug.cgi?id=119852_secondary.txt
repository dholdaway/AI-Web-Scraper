Description


Benoît Knecht





          2006-01-21 12:26:24 UTC
        

When running 'genlop -r', I got this kind of errors:
Malformed UTF-8 character (1 byte, need 3, after start byte 0xe7) at /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.6/Date/Manip.pm line 7167.
Manip.pm belongs to dev-perl/DateManip-5.44, and converting it from latin1 to UTF-8 solved the problem.
