I believe this post crosses the line.  It has nothing to do with the topic at hand, and seems to purely divert the topic into trolling / provoking the dev.

Yes, it was intentional and intended to challenge bircoph's apparent contradictions against other topics on the mailing list.  Opining for freedom of choice in one thread while seemingly locking things down in another.  Call it trolling or provocation if you desire.

So, proctors.  This is an easy one.  Do your thing.

For the record, I'm only asking to put the flame down before people get emotional over it.

Apparently I was wrong and people didn't take the bait.  Sorry for the noise.
