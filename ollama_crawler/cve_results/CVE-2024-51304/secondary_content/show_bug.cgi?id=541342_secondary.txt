Description

looking through CVS, it looks like =www-client/firefox-32.0 began supporting the gstreamer use flag to build against gstreamer-1.0.  Then it seems to have been undone when the updated ebuild for ESR =www-client/firefox-31.0.2 came out.

I.e. it looks like the v33.0 and v31.0.2 ebuilds were based on the v31.0.1 ebuild, whereas the v33.0 ebuild should have been based on v32.0.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. review CVS
2. attempt to install a current version of Firefox built against gstreamer-1.0

Actual Results:  
It's not possible

Expected Results:  
I should have been able to install a version of Firefox built against gstreamer-1.0 to avoid the libav / ffmpeg dependency hell.
