I open a NIKON JPG file and select
Image
   Image Metadata

A rather narrow window is opened. The values for the the Exif Tags are shown incompletely. I try to increase the width of the window. It is reacting very slowly. Beside of this there is pixel garbage in the upper two text lines of the window.

Hi!

I cannot reproduce the issue and my guess would be that it's not specific to Gimp (but something down the stack e.g. graphics driver, Xorg, GTK).
If you run an intel graphics card, maybe update your drivers.

I suggest we close this ticket.  Okay?
