Net interest income stabilized, expenses were well-controlled, credit costs remained low, and our capital position continued to improve. We also continued to invest in our differentiated fee-based businesses which we anticipate will gain traction as conditions improve in the capital markets.  I am proud of the work and dedication of our teammates in executing on our strategic priorities and steadfastly serving our clients while navigating a turbulent year. In 2023, we grew relationship deposits, improved balance sheet resiliency, exceeded our goal of reducing risk-weighted assets, maintained expense discipline, and benefited from our de-risked loan portfolio and distinctive underwrite-to-distribute model.I am fully confident these actions will position Key to deliver sound, profitable growth, realize our  earnings potential, and drive substantive value for all of our stakeholders in the years ahead."(a)December 31, 2023 ratio is estimated and reflects Key's election to adopt the CECL optional transition provision.(b)December 31, 2023 figures are estimated.(c)See table on page 25 for more information on Selected Items Impacts to Earnings.
