kicker's memory usage slowly increases over time, eventually requiring a dcop kicker kicker restart to prevent it continually swapping.

has been doing this since 3.3, currently running kde-base/kicker-3.5.3-r1

loaded applets:
 k-menu button
 numerous launchers
 system monitor
 kcpufreq
 task list
 system tray
 lock/logout buttons
 kweather
 moon phase indicator
 kworldclock
 math evaluator thingy
 mixer
 kbinaryclock
 ksim

Same problem with 3.5.4-r1? If so, please remove the applets and readd and test them one by one to find offending one.

I can't reproduce with latest KDE.   If you can find the source of the memory leak with a current kicker, please reopen.
