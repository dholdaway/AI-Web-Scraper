Description


Jan Seeger





          2007-07-06 11:35:13 UTC
        

When emerging foomatic-filters, it did not put a link to foomatic-rip into the /usr/libexec/cups/filters directory, resulting in cups not finding the filter and not being able to print. Linking foomatic-rip to /usr/bin/foomatic-rip solved the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Emerge cups
2.emerge foomatic-filters
3.Print

Actual Results:  
Something along the lines of "foomatic-rip exited with status 22"

Expected Results:  
Printed^^

check your foomatic version to be the latest available and make sure that you have USE=cups set. Please reopen and attach emerge info if it still does not work
