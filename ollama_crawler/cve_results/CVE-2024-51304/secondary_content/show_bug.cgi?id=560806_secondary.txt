emerge --info

I use qt 5.4.2 but I cannot find the documentations in dev-qt/assitant:5 like qt 4.8.7. Then I search for google to find some solutions.Luckily they say just register qch files in dev-qt/assistant will solve the problem but I cannot find any qch file in my /usr/share directory.
This morning I just try to emerge my qtcore 5.4.2 and I can see the DOCDIR was configured to /usr/share/doc/qt-5.4.2/ but finally I just see some qtdocconf file in /usr/share/doc/qt-5.4.2/global. Did the ebuild have some problems？ 
Thanks for your time.

Do you have dev-qt/qt-docs installed?

Oh, I have not found the package when the bug is filed. Thanks for your advice, I have installed qt-docs-5.5 and added it in assistant.
