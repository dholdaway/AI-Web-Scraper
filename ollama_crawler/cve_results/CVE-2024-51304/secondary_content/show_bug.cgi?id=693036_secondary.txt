Ralph has been an active Gentoo user for approximately 15 years, maintaining
servers for himself and his customers. He has made several contributions via
GitHub pull requests and brought in www-servers/nginx-unit as a new
package for which he is the active proxy maintainer [2].

Professionally, Ralph graduated with a Master's degree in Computer
Science circa 1996, he runs his own business as a software architect,
developer, and consultant [2]. Overall, he brings more than 35 years of
experience in software development with him.

He will be working on his quizzes and we will let recruiters know once he is ready.

Adding Doc as he is local to Ralph's timezone and can assist in the German conspiracy :)

As such, Doc and I will mentor Ralph.

Update for recruiters: We are still working with Ralph to finalize his quizzes. The delay is mostly on me as my time has been monopolized elsewhere.

Recruiters, Ralph should be sending his final quiz within the next day or two.

Quiz sent with message ID <87eeyu28he.fsf@wedjat.horus-it.com>.

I uploaded my freshly minted PGP key block to pool.sks-keyservers.net a few minutes ago, but a search does not show it yet (probably due to some caching). The key block is also available at https://seichter.de/pgp/morbius.txt , as stated in the signed quiz.

Trivia: My nickname Morbius does not, as some (probably younger) readers assumed, have anything to do with the Marvel Comics character introduced in 1971. Instead, it refers to Dr. Edward Morbius[1] of "Forbidden Planet" (1956).

I will be your recruiter. Always add a comment to this bug when you send something to that address. Please contact me by IRC or email to schedule the first review session. If you think that recruiters aren't paying attention to this bug at any later point in time, it's your job to ping us on IRC if you don't want any delays.
