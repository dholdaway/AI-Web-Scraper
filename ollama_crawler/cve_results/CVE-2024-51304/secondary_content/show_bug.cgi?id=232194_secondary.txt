Until fix_libtool_files.sh is deprecated (bug #90744) and references to it has been removed from the guides under http://www.gentoo.org/doc/ it should work correctly, and currently it does not since fixlafiles.awk is now installed under /usr/share/gcc-data/$CHOST/<gcc-version>/  instead of /lib/rcscripts/awk/  but fix_libtool_files.sh still looks for it in the old location. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
$ /usr/share/gcc-data/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/4.3.1/fix_libtool_files.sh 4.1.2

Actual Results:  
fix_libtool_files.sh: /lib/rcscripts/awk/fixlafiles.awk does not exist!

toolchain.eclass copies it to the expected place during pkg_postinst
