I recently emerged gnome on 6/6/05, and tried to add the 'network monitor'
applet to the panel. only thing is, the icon does not update. it's just a
computer monitor looking thing with a red circle and white line through it. if i
click on the 'connection properties' the status updates as expected (idle,
receving, sending, etc) with the total data payloads in each direction working
as expected also.

i emerged another "network monitor" applet for gnome, and it worked just fine.

might want to hold off or figure out what's going on with that.

I believe he is referring to net-analyzer/gnome-netstatus package.  The 2.10.0
ebuild (marked as stable) produces behaviour as described in the original post.
 Upgrading to 2.10.0-r1 resolved the problem.
