When installing the kernel, (bare with me, I'm new to Linux.) your handbook suggests using "USE="-doc symlink" emerge gentoo-sources" for 2005.1, but when I type the command in it says "emerge: command not found".

I don't know any way around it because I'm new. Help?

Your $PATH is broken. This is not a bug, your system settings are invalid.

If this comes from the installation, please follow our Handbook literally. You'll have to be chrooted in order to use `emerge`.
