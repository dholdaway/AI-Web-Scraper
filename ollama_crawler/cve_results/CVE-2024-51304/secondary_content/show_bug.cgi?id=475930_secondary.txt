Description

Hello,

I have a GPT'd HDD, on which I want to install Gentoo.

I downloaded the latest minimal install cd (27 06 2013), booted the cd, tried to use parted (as fdisk doesn't work with GPT) and got an error message (something about library not being accessible). Sorry if the description is minimal, but I'm still new to Linux.

The latest install cd currently does not have a functioning "parted".

Regards,
Eli

Please paste the exact name of the install-cd you've used.

I don't think this is still an issue, is anyone still experiencing this problem?
