Can I suggest that we add some more descriptive text to
 http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=2&amp;chap=1#doc_chap4

So that under the example output:

[blocks B     ] mail-mta/ssmtp (is blocking mail-mta/postfix-2.2.2-r1

we add the description.

"Such a message indicates that you have either ssmtp or postfix installed which is blocking the other"

Reproducible: Always

That would be wrong.
"[blocks B     ] mail-mta/ssmtp (is blocking mail-mta/postfix-2.2.2-r1"
means exactly what it displayed. Don't try to read more from it.

Read that section again:
"both can't be installed on the same system together."
&
"you can opt not to install postfix or to remove ssmtp first."
