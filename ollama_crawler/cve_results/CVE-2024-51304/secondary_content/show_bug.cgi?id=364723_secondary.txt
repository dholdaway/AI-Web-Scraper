dcraw currently has freedist as the license.

Reading dcraw.c:
   No license is required to download and use dcraw.c.  However,
   to lawfully redistribute dcraw, you must either (a) offer, at
   no extra charge, full source code* for all executable files
   containing RESTRICTED functions, (b) distribute this code under
   the GPL Version 2 or later, (c) remove all RESTRICTED functions,
   re-implement them, or copy them from an earlier, unrestricted
   Revision of dcraw.c, or (d) purchase a license from the author.

   The functions that process Foveon images have been RESTRICTED
   since Revision 1.237.  All other code remains free for all uses.

This sounds to me: Most of the code is public domain, some parts are GPL-2. So the correct license variable would be:
LICENSE="public-domain GPL-2"

Hm, yea, this is not GPL at all. But I'm not sure this is public domain, since we have author and copyright (1997-2010 by Dave Coffin).

@license: any ideas? If not I'd better created dcraw license file...

I'm not sure about the "most of the code is public" part, but what seems to be clear is that we can choose option (b) and distribute the package under GPL-2.

BTW, the Debian folks have discussed it too, see <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=431883>, especially message #65.

Thank you Ulrich. Then current license works for me.
