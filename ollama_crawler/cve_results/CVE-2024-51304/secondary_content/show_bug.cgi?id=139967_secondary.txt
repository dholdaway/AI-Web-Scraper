Description

From /etc/make.conf.example:
#   Default:       "rsync://rsync.gentoo.org/gentoo-portage"
#   North America: "rsync://rsync.namerica.gentoo.org/gentoo-portage"
#   South America: "rsync://rsync.samerica.gentoo.org/gentoo-portage"
#   Europe:        "rsync://rsync.europe.gentoo.org/gentoo-portage"
#   Asia:          "rsync://rsync.asia.gentoo.org/gentoo-portage"
#   Australia:     "rsync://rsync.au.gentoo.org/gentoo-portage"

This naming scheme is totaly wrong. DNS is meant to be hierarchical, grouping things together, which belong together. And all those servers have one thing in common: They are rsync-Servers.
The correct naming would be something like: asia.rsync.gentoo.org because out of all of gentoo's rsync-servers (rsync.gentoo.org), we have the asia ones.


The currently used scheme would only make sense, if there were a group of servers, in asia, out of which we want the rsync-ones. But there is no www.asia.gentoo.org, or ftp.asia.gentoo.org.

Well, apart from the theory part of things, the naming scheme works just fine..and has been doing so without any issues for a while.

and even the theory part of things is debatable.  You have your opinions, we have ours, thanks for sharing.

It's not a matter of opinions, it's a matter of following standards and simple logic. The current scheme is just utterly wrong. 


Okay, it works, but it would also work if you named the servers r.s.y.c.e.u.r.o.p.e.gentoo.org, however nobody would ever think of naming them this way, because it's against common sense.
The same way the current scheme isn't common sense.
