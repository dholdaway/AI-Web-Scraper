Description


Maurice van der Pot (RETIRED)






          2008-08-30 11:20:47 UTC
        

If twisted-words-0.4.0-r1 is installed and the user upgrades twisted, applications that use both will fail to start:

"ImportError! You probably forgot to install Twisted Words or Web. Have a look at the docs. You may also be using an unsupported version of Twisted."

Consequently upgrading twisted-words to 8.1.0 fixes it.

Shouldn't twisted block old twisted-words versions to make sure people upgrade?
