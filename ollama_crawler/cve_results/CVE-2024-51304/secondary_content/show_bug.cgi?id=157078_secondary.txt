Emerging gaia 0.1.1 I get the following:

 * checking ebuild checksums ;-) ...                                                                                 [ ok ]
 * checking auxfile checksums ;-) ...                                                                                [ ok ]
 * checking miscfile checksums ;-) ...                                                                               [ !! ]

!!! Digest verification failed:
!!! /usr/portage/x11-misc/gaia/ChangeLog
!!! Reason: Filesize does not match recorded size
!!! Got: 524
!!! Expected: 530

I did an emerge --sync a few minutes before. emerge --digest gaia works fine.
