+  22 Feb 2015; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> package.use.mask:
+  Mask media-libs/gegl[umfpack] because of non-keyworded dep.

Feel free to keyword and eventually stabilize instead.

Due to the deps of umfpack being rather heavyweight, we (alpha team) will wait for a user request before keywording.
