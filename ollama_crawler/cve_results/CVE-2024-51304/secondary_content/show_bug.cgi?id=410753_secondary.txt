Description

Triggered by another bug, it is found that package py has content that does not support python3.

/usr/lib64/python3.2/site-packages/py/_io/terminalwriter.py

    def _getbytestring(self, s):
        # XXX review this and the whole logic
        if self.encoding and sys.version_info[0] < 3 and isinstance(s, unicode):
etc

The module unicode no longer exists.  The function fails under at least python3.

That's why it checks sys.version_info[0]. Works for me.
