After installing skype-1.3 (probably the older version too, don't exactly remember) it refused to cooperate due to missing libstdc++5, as in bug 109746. Differently to that one virtual/libstdc++ was already installed, but not helping. Installing app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-compat-1.0-r1 solved the issue.
Now i'm quite new to all the amd64 stuff, but i think emul-linux-x86-compat should be a dep on amd64 then, or is this a PEBKAC issue?

Thanks

Call it bad timing, but that line was added only a couple of hours ago after i initially found the problem but before i got to report it.
