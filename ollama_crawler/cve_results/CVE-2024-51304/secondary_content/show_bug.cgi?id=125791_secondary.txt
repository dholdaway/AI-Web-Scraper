No longer a security issue with current stable portage (see Bug 124962), re-assigning to maintainer.

I can't reproduce this. Could you please post your 'emerge --info' along with version numbers of ruby and rubygems?

I haven't tried to emerge this package again until now, and now it works. I have no idea what changed, or what fixed it, but this error no longer occurs.

Thanks bug trackers for looking into this, though.
