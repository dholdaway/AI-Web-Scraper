 Inside Workiva Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
We expect reduced valuation multiples caused by higher interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical instability to continue to negatively impact the number of IPOs and SPACs in fiscal year 2024.



 Other - Other   Highlight
In addition, during 2023 we recorded one-time fees of $0.6 million related to the cancellation of certain events.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Other expense increased $2.7 million in 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to losses on the sale of available-for-sale securities and losses on foreign currency transactions.

 Other - Other   Highlight
In addition, the lease requires us to purchase the building from the landlord upon certain events, such as a change in control.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Other costs included in this expense are marketing and promotional events, our annual user conference, online marketing, product marketing, information technology costs, and facility costs.
