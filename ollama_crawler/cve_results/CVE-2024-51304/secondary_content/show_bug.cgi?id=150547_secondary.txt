Both verions in portage of dev-db/pgadmin3 1.2.2 and 1.4.3 don't compile if you are using the latest stable of x11-libs/wxGTK which is version 2.6.2-r1.

If I unmask x11-libs/wxGTK by packages.keywords and update to x11-libs/wxGTK to version 2.6.3.3, dev-db/pgadmin3-1.4.3 compiles succesfully. But I still can't start it. :(

The error message which occurs if I try to start dev-db/pgadmin3-1.4.3 using x11-libs/wxGTK-2.6.3.3 is following:

error: /usr/lib/libwx_gtk2u_stc-2.6.so.0: symbol _ZTV7wxEvent, version
WXU_2.6 not defined in file libwx_gtk2u_core-2.6.so.0 with link time reference

I figured out, why pgadmin3 doesn't starts on my system. It is because of symbols with underscores in the beginning (see the error message) are seldom public members in C++ and I have enabled the CXXFLAG -fvisibility-inlines-hidden which (please tell me if I'm wrong) hides not-public symbols. However if I filter this flag by pgadmin3's ebuild, it works. I will upload a patch which adds a corresponding filter-flag line.

Sorry I meant wxGTK, not pgadmin3. It is a problem with x11-libs/wxGTK.

1.4.3 did compile for me, and starts without problems. 
I don't know if this is related, but I recently made an `emerge --emptytree world' due to GCC upgrade to 4.

./src/include/pgAdmin3.h:52:2: #error wxGTK 2.7.0 or higher is required to compile this version of pgAdmin.

Then i think we need wxGTK 2.7.0

using -fvisibility-inlines-hidden is not supported, so don't use it. ;P

the rest of the comments on this bug are unrelated.
