I'm compiling with x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-3.4.3 as root. Let me know what else you might need to troubleshoot.

Output:

This works for me.  You have the file system mounted as noexec or something like
that?

Actually this is just a really old bug that has since been fixed a long time
ago. I just forgot about it.
