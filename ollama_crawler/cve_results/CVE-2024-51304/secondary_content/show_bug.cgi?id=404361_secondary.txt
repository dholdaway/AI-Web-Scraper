The ebuild sci-chemistry/vmd-1.9.1 asks for the file 
http://dev.gentoo.org/~jlec/distfiles/vmd-1.9.1-gentoo-patches.tar.xz
to be placed in distdir but that URI gives a 404.

Why do you not distribute it like other patches?

Correction. 1.9.1 never wanted anything from d.g.o/~jlec/... It was always:

SRC_URI="mirror://gentoo/${P}-gentoo-patches.tar.xz
 	${P}.src.tar.gz"

You can check:
