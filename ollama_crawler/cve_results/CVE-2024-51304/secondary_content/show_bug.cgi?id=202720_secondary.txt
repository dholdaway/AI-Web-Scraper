Description

The summary is I think rather clear. When I want to emerge xorg-server, netkit-rsh is installed as a dependency (via xsm and xinit). The problem is that netkit-rsh fail to compile because it can't find a C compiler which is obviously installed on my system.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Try to emerge netkit-rsh
2.
3.

As a result of this bug, xorg-server can't be compiled !

If I disable distcc (which runs on a i686 machine), netkit-rsh can be emerged.
