vmware-workstation gives poor permissions on certain files when running vmware-config.pl if /etc/profile umask is 077. What I mean by this, is that some users (such as myself) perfer new files to be owned only by the user that creates them so i set the default umask to be 077.

The problem is that every time i run /opt/vmware/workstation/bin/vmware-config.pl the following files get impractical permissions:

/opt/vmware/workstation/lib/libconf/etc/pango/pango.modules
/opt/vmware/workstation/lib/libconf/etc/pango/pango.rc
/opt/vmware/workstation/lib/libconf/etc/pango/pango.aliases
/opt/vmware/workstation/lib/libconf/etc/gtk-2.0/gdk-pixbuf.loaders
/opt/vmware/workstation/lib/libconf/etc/gtk-2.0/gtk.immodules

resulting in vmware only being executable by root. I usually fix this by manually chmoding the files to 644 (though perhaps 640 and put them in vmware group woudl be better).

Anyway, I feel that the config script should adjust the permissions to something more practical.

When messing w/ default umask, you are on your own.

I understand that modifying /etc/profile umask is unsupported.

However, you don't think that having the files installed by vmware-workstation not have permissions consistant with root owner/vmware group is incorrect?

Also, at the same time, making these files have reasonable permissions regardless of the default umask is not a huge modification to the install script (and the script already has gentoo specific touches).

Certainly with other packages, the permissions/ownership are occasionally altered to fit the gentoo scheme. (games, cdrw, locate, etc).
