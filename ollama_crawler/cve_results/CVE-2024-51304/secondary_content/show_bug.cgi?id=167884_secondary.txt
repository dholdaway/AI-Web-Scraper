Description

When a laptop is turned on w/o AC power plugged in, things like anacron should be deferred. This is the default behaviour in debian, and I was wondered to discovered it is not an upstream anacron feature.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
turn on a laptop w/ anacron installed and daily/weekly job pending

Actual Results:  
the job will start running in a few minutes

Expected Results:  
w/o AC power on, it should have been deferred

Following debian, amended start() in /etc/init.d/anacron to
defer when on battery, as follows:
	start() {
		ebegin "Running anacron"
		if test -x /usr/bin/on_ac_power 
		then
			/usr/bin/on_ac_power >/dev/null
			if test $? -eq 1
			then
			  ewarn "deferred while on battery power."
			fi
		else
			/usr/sbin/anacron -s >>/var/log/cron.log 2>&1
		fi
		eend $?
	}

You may make it into a use flag (I suggest it being a default feature) if you think it's not a sensible change, although I can't imagine somebody acknowledging sporadic cronjob runs enough to install anacron in the 1st place, and object to such a change.

Uh, use runlevels for this.

Thanks for the tip! a much better solution, indeed, and also provides for
auto-starting anacron back once plugged in.
