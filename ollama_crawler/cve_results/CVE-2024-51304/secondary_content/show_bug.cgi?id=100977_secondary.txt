kcontrol should install /usr/kde/3.4/share/doc/HTML/en/kinfocenter/, don't you 
have it?

interesting is that i have directories there, for kinfocenter and for each 
module but they are empty (only symlinks to common directory)... also "qpkg -l 
kcontrol | grep kinfocenter" returns 
 
/usr/kde/3.4/bin/kinfocenter -> kcontrol 1118263646 
/usr/kde/3.4/share/apps/kinfocenter 
/usr/kde/3.4/share/apps/kinfocenter/kinfocenterui.rc 
/usr/kde/3.4/share/applications/kde/kinfocenter.desktop 
 
i don't know how to check which package owns directory, "qpkg -f <directory>" 
don't work.

All the files are there in usr/kde/3.4/share/doc/HTML/en/kinfocenter/ if I do 
an "ebuild /usr/portage/kde-base/kcontrol/kcontrol-3.4.2.ebuild install", I 
don't know what to say...

Yes, that's true... 
After update to ~x86 there is kinfocenter modules documentation.
