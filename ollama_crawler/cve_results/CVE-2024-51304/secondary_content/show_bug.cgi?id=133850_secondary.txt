Trying to emerge lastfmplayer, i've got this:

>>> Unpacking source...
 * subversion update start -->
 *      repository: svn://svn.audioscrobbler.net/player/branches/1.2
Alla revisione 2099.
 *    working copy: /mnt/data/portage/distfiles/svn-src/lastfmplayer/1.2

>>> Source unpacked.
>>> Compiling source in /var/tmp/portage/lastfmplayer-1.2_pre2099/work/lastfmplayer-1.2_pre2099 ...
make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.

!!! ERROR: media-sound/lastfmplayer-1.2_pre2099 failed.
Call stack:
  ebuild.sh, line 1527:   Called dyn_compile
  ebuild.sh, line 931:   Called src_compile
  lastfmplayer-1.2_pre2099.ebuild, line 38:   Called die

!!! emake failed
!!! If you need support, post the topmost build error, and the call stack if relevant.

Does anyone know anything about why it happens?
Thank you

Probably the qmake did not run correctly for you. Are you sure you have qt4 installed and no qt3 paths before the qt4-ones?

Actually i've got qt4 slotted beside qt3. Do i need to declare the path of qt4 somewhere?

are you using multilib?
so that all paths are /usr/lib64?

Yes i am
Yesterday, though, i had to reinstall the operative system, because of a filesystem corruption, and when i tried to emerge lastfmplayer, it worked like a charme. Can't reproduce the difference from the former installation, since i think i didnt make anything different than before, but that's it: now it works great.
I'm sorry i could'nt be more help to solve the issue.
