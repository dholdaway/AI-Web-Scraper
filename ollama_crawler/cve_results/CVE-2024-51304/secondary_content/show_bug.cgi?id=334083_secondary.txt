Hopefully these will help users who haven't yet emerged adobe-flash or are for some reason incapable of reading the output of einfo... ;)

I know about that, but there's no point in restating it in the guide when the ebuild itself has the same information. Hence the pointer to read the emerge output.

Also, since there is a chance that Adobe will re-release a 64-bit Flash version, the simple pointer is better than having to add/remove the same workaround text over and over.
