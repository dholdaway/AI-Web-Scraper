build log

On an otherwise brand new install, I am getting the attached build log. For whatever it's worth, I'm using the `default/linux/amd64/17.1/desktop/gnome/systemd` profile.

zziplib block numerous other packages.

Works for me.  Likely a local configuration problem with binutils via binutils-config.

It was apparently because I was in a chroot. I exited it, logged in normally, and it worked.

I don't know whether it's interesting for anybody to try and reproduce it, but maybe this is what happens if you try to migrate to 17.1 while still in the handbook chroot.
