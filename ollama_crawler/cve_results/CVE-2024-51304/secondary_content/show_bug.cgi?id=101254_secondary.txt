Description

Building map in Gtkradiant is impossible because q3map2 is missing in
/opt/gtkradiant. However /opt/grkradiant/q3map2.x86 DO exists and creating
symlink to it solves the problem. This way(or renaming q3map2.x86 to q3map2) the
gtkgradiant package can be fixed.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start gtkradiant
2. Create map
3. Build it

Actual Results:  
The error of impossible building occured.

Expected Results:  
Build the map

Create symlink from or rename /opt/gtkradiant/q3map2.x86 to
/opt/gtkradiant/q3map2 to fix the problem. This can also be fixed by modifying
~/.radiant/VERSION_NUMBER/GAME_NAME/build_menu.xml and in fact, I'm not sure if
the build_menu.xml in my home is corrupted only. However I haven't touched it so
I don't believe this is my fault.

gtkradiant was updated a while ago. Can you test it now, with the last version in portage?

Problem seems not there.
No answer from Reporter, and works for me
