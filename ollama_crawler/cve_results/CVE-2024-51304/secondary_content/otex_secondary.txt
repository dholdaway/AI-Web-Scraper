 Inside Open Text Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Income   Highlight
A change to these factors could impact the estimated valuation allowance and income tax expense.



 Other - Other   Highlight
Some of these accounting policies involve complex situations and require a higher degree of judgment, either in the application and interpretation of existing accounting literature or in the development of estimates that affect our financial statements.

 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
The focus of the CRA audit has been the valuation of certain intellectual property and goodwill when one of our subsidiaries continued into Canada from Luxembourg in July 2016.

 Other - Other   Highlight
As described more fully below, we are unable at this time to estimate a possible loss or range of losses in respect of certain disclosed matters.

 Legal - Other   Highlight
Quarterly, we review the status of each significant legal matter and evaluate such matters to determine how they should be treated for accounting and disclosure purposes in accordance with the requirements of ASC Topic 450-20 “Loss Contingencies” (Topic 450-20).
