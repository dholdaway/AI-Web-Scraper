Dollar General Corporation Reports Fourth
Quarter and Fiscal Year 2023 Results
 
Provides
Financial Guidance for Fiscal 2024 First Quarter and Full Year
 
GOODLETTSVILLE,
Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Dollar General Corporation (NYSE: DG) today reported financial results for
its fiscal year 2023 fourth quarter (13 weeks) and fiscal year (52 weeks) ended February 2, 2024 (“fiscal 2023”).
 
Note: Dollar General's results
for the fiscal full year and fourth quarter ended February 3, 2023 (“fiscal 2022”) contain an additional, non-comparable
week, or the "53rd week”, when compared to the full year and fourth quarter results for the respective 52- and 13-week periods
ended February 2, 2024. By definition, the Company's same-store sales growth calculations do not include the non-comparable 53rd
week in the fiscal 2022 periods. Financial metrics discussed in this release, such as net sales, operating income, net income and earnings
per share (“EPS”), are calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and therefore
include the 53rd week for the applicable fiscal 2022 periods.
 

·Fourth Quarter Net Sales Decreased 3.4% to $9.9 Billion;
Fiscal Year Net Sales Increased 2.2% to $38.7 Billion

·Fourth Quarter Same-Store Sales Increased 0.7%; Fiscal Year
Same-Store Sales Increased 0.2%

·Fourth Quarter Operating Profit Decreased 37.9% to $579.7
Million; Fiscal Year Operating Profit Decreased 26.5% to $2.4 Billion

·Fourth Quarter Diluted EPS Decreased 38.2% to $1.83; Fiscal
Year Diluted EPS Decreased 29.3% to $7.55

·Annual Cash Flows From Operations Increased 20.5% to $2.4
Billion

·Board of Directors Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.59
per share
 
“We were pleased to
deliver fourth quarter top and bottom-line results at the upper end of our internal expectations,” said Todd Vasos, Dollar General’s
chief executive officer. “With customer traffic growth and market share gains during the quarter, we believe our actions are resonating
with customers as they turn to Dollar General for our unique combination of value and convenience.”
 
“We have made solid
progress executing on our Back to Basics strategy, which we believe supported our improved operational performance during the quarter.
While we are pleased with the operational improvement we have seen, we believe that significant opportunity remains, as we continue to
focus on enhancing the way we support our teams and serve our customers.”
 
“I want to thank our
associates for their resilience and commitment to serving our customers every day. Looking ahead, we are excited about our plans for 2024
and are confident that we are taking the right actions to further solidify our foundation for future growth and create sustainable long-term
value for our shareholders.”
 
Fourth Quarter Fiscal
2023 Highlights
 
Net sales decreased 3.4%
to $9.9 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to $10.2 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, which included net
sales for the 53rd week of $678.1 million. The net sales decrease was primarily driven by the period containing one less week of sales
than the prior year period, as well as the impact of store closures; partially offset by positive sales contributions from new stores
and growth in same-store sales. Same-store sales increased 0.7% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, driven by an increase
in customer traffic, partially offset by a decrease in average transaction amount. Same-store sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023
included growth in the consumables category, partially offset by declines in each of the home products, seasonal, and apparel categories.

 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
If our estimates of future cash flows are not materially accurate, our impairment analysis could be impacted accordingly.

 Other - Other   Highlight
However, our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity may be affected by numerous factors, many of which are outside of our control.

 Other - Other   Highlight
If our determinations and estimates prove to be inaccurate, the resulting adjustments could be material to our future financial results.
