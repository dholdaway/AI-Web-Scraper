The =dev-java/icedtea-6.1.9.7-r1 ebuild in the java-overlay overlay is the same as the =dev-java/icedtea-6.1.9.7-r1 ebuild in portage.

Is there any chance that this duplication could be avoided?

I upload them there before they are added to the main tree by the Gentoo maintainers.  I don't see how this is a problem.

It is for the change tracking in subversion that we don't delete the overlay version even after it's added to the main tree. Also the overlay version might have features that are deemed too experimental for the main tree. Currently it's the same, but I don't see any problem with it.
