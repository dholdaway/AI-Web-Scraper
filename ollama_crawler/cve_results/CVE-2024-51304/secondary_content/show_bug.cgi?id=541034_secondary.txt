+  22 Feb 2015; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> glpk-4.54.ebuild:
+  Drop ~alpha because of a number of non-keyworded deps.

Feel free to re-add ~alpha once the deps are keyworded (amd, colamd...).

Due to the deps being rather heavyweight, we (alpha team) will wait for a user request before keywording.
