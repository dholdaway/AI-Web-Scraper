Description

The XBMC ebuild requires Samba to be built with USE=smbclient. Samba 4 does not support this USE flag and it is also not required for Samba 4.

Reproducible: Always

i've used the (+) marker instead so the ebuild can assume that if the flag doesn't exist, it must be enabled

Commit message: Support newer samba where USE=smbclient is always enabled

Where has the fix gone? It disappeared from all XBMC ebuilds again. Copy & paste error?

Sorry, my tree was outpdated. Everything works as expected.
