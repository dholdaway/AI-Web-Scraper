Description

I get the following error when I attempt to run =net-im/gajim-0.10.1:

tcort@candcc0 ~ $ gajim
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "gajim.py", line 36, in ?
    import message_control
  File "/usr/share/gajim/src/message_control.py", line 15, in ?
    import gtk.glade
ImportError: No module named glade

This is because dev-python/pygtk only builds gtk.glade if dev-util/glade is installed. Can someone add dev-util/glade to DEPEND in dev-python/pygtk?

emm, i don't believe so. it depends on gnome-base/libglade rather than dev-util/glade. here's the configure.in

dnl libglade
PKG_CHECK_MODULES(LIBGLADE, [libglade-2.0 >= libglade_required_version],
        build_libglade=true, build_libglade=false)
AC_SUBST(LIBGLADE_CFLAGS)
AC_SUBST(LIBGLADE_LIBS)
AM_CONDITIONAL(BUILD_LIBGLADE, $build_libglade)
if test -n "$export_dynamic"; then
  LIBGLADE_LIBS=`echo $LIBGLADE_LIBS | sed -e "s/$export_dynamic//"`
fi

I'd have to agree with Alastair here, all works fine when i tested without glade installed. (Bug #139446)

libglade is a DEPEND of pygtk, pygtk is a DEPEND of gajim. I fail to see the issue ?

The issue is pygtk-2.8.6 keyworded ~alpha, so alpha has this issue from pygtk-2.6.1's gnome flag.

marking pygtk-2.8.6 stable on alpha fixed the problem.
