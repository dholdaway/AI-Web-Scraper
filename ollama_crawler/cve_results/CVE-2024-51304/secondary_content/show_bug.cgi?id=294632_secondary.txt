It seems that lxml requires >=setuptools-0.6c5 which I assume in Gentoo is >=setuptools-0.6.6 which is keyword masked.  It was my understanding that a package couldn't be unmasked in Gentoo without all of its dependancies being unmasked as well.  Solution, keyword mask this version or stabilize setuptools ~0.6.6.

emerging dev-python/setuptools-0.6.6 and then dev-python/lxml-2.2.2 resolved the problem for me.

0.6c5 means 0.6_rc5.
dev-python/setuptools-0.6.6 is already stable for some time.
