Our current example isn't very helpful:

"As an example partitioning, we show you one for a 20GB disk, used as a demonstration laptop"...

Maybe we could update this for a more modern system?  Something like:

/        500M
/boot    250M
/opt       5G
/usr      20G
/var      10G
/home       *  (the rest)

This is based on my laptops - I have about 15G used in /usr (including portage distfiles), 10G for /var is mainly for WORKDIR and ccache, /opt is a guess, I don't seem to have anything in there. I _think_ it's a typical setup but I might be weird. ;D

Don't forget how popular netbooks and low-storage devices like "affordable" SSDs are. On my desktop, I only have a 30GB SSD for /, so I had to buy a 16GB SSD for /var and /usr/portage. The examples work fine; don't forget the actual configuration used throughout the handbook, mentioned a couple of paragraphs up:

Partition       Filesystem 	Size 	Description
/dev/sda1 	ext2 	        32M 	Boot partition
/dev/sda2 	(swap) 	        512M 	Swap partition
/dev/sda3 	ext3 	        Rest of the disk 	Root partition

That example there is pretty good for showing all the things you can put on even a small hard disk.

I like it as-is, so for now I'll mark this WORKSFORME. However, we've got some other pending bugs for GPT, filesystems, and other disk-related things, so don't be surprised if you see this example change more closely to your suggestion. Thanks for the ideas!
