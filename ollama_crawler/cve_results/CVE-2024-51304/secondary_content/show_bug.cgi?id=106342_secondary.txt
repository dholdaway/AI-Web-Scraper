When using my new kernel 2.6.13.1 as opposed to 2.6.11.11. baselayout seems to decrease the verbosity 
when initializing the network. I'm not sure if it's intended, but i like the verbose layout better (esp. when 
debugging), maybe there's an option that forces this behaviour ? In both cases, the interfaces are 
configured correctly.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. boot from old kernel
2. boot from new kernel
Actual Results:  
silent initialization


Expected Results:  
verbose initializtion

Those 6 modules you're autoloading - would any of them be a module for your network card? I would say that's know behaviour with 1.12.0_pre8.

Try pre17-r2 and make note of the new "Device initiated services" message on boot and read up on the new RC_COLDPLUG setting in /etc/conf.d/rc if you don't like it.

BTW, to get that working really well, you will need a 2.6.15 kernel and udev-089 or higher.
