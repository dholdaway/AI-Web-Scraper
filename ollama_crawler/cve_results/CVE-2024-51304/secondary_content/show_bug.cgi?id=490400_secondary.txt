As per #463250 (closed without a solution), booting an lvm2 root on a systemd is not possible.

An lvm2 root is a relatively common scenario, so a solution for this is needed.

Reproducible: Always

You need to use an initramfs, generated by genkernel-next with the --udev flag.
Then you will be able to use lvm and systemd.

There is nothing to fix :) It already works.

Hmmkay, my fault then. Was just a matter of explicitly requesting static-libs from lvm2, which cascaded down to virtual/udev wanting static-libs... A grep in package.use/ shows it was my fault, and that I had assumed genkernel-next was requesting that flag through cryptsetup.

It appears the old culprit (cryptsetup with static use, which I need to mount /) doesn't depend on that anymore.

Therefore, nevermind.

If you switch to any new gnome/kde systemd profiles you will prevent strange dependency issues like that ;)

I could never bring myself to use a desktop-specific profile as while I use KDE I love to keep the alternatives installed to try them from time to time rather than commit myself with a kde profile... yet a more generic systemd profile would be an easy sell.
