This bug doesn't exist in gentoo yet, but I thought maybe you'd like the heads up. I installed gtk+ 2.13.1 in my overlay and the collision detector made me notice this entry in the 2.13.0 news file:
"
 * Accessibility:
  - The gail module is now shipped as part of GTK+
"
I think this means all ebuilds that depend on gail need to change to depend on virtual/gail instead, and when gtk+ 2.14 comes out, you can just make it provide virtual/gail easily if you start changing over the ebuilds now.

A quick grep in my portage tree gives this list of packages, but some might be missing since I do exclude some categories via rsync-excludes:
app-accessibility/at-poke
app-accessibility/gnopernicus
app-accessibility/gok
app-editors/ghex
dev-perl/Geography-Countries
dev-util/glade
gnome-base/eel
gnome-base/gail
gnome-base/gnome
gnome-base/gnome-applets
gnome-base/libgnomecanvas
gnome-extra/at-spi
gnome-extra/gnome-media
gnome-extra/gtkhtml
gnome-extra/libgail-gnome
x11-misc/glunarclock

If everyone is already aware of this, of course feel free to ignore me and close this bug.

Yes, we are aware of this. To that effect the gnome overlay has a gail ebuild that provides a migration path, as seen here:

Though I think we are missing a blocker on gail in gtk+-2.13.x in the overlay and possibly other things necessary to make this a _painless_ migration
