It does here..

antarus@kyoto ~/gentoo/gentoo/xml/htdocs/proj/en/glep $ sudo emerge -Ca portage
Password:

>>> These are the packages that would be unmerged:


!!! 'sys-apps/portage' is part of your system profile.
!!! Unmerging it may be damaging to your system.


 sys-apps/portage
    selected: 2.1.1-r2
   protected: none
     omitted: none

>>> 'Selected' packages are slated for removal.
>>> 'Protected' and 'omitted' packages will not be removed.

Would you like to unmerge these packages? [Yes/No]  

Does the question show up even?

If you hit enter twice, then the second enter will answer [yes] to that questoin and bypass it completely, you need to be careful.

Did you press the "Enter" key more than once?  Be careful, because the "Enter" key alone means "yes".
