It looks like your machine is having problems generating the completion and man page files. Does this still occur with later versions in the tree? If so can you try running the related commands manually and see if the same issues occur?

I just re-emerged =media-gfx/gmic-2.5.4 (but from the 4nykey overlay) with the "cli" flag enabled and no problems were found.

I'm not able to reproduce this with older or the more recent versions now in the tree. Feel free to reopen if it's still relevant with new versions.
