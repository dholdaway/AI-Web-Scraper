Description

When i've tried to emerge mkvtoolnix, libboost was emerged successfully (as dependency), but mkvtoolnix build failed during configuration step with following message:

checking for main in -lboost_regex... no
checking for main in -lboost_regex-boost_regex... no
configure: error: Could not link against boost_regex-boost_regex !

Then i did "eselect boost set 1", after that mkvtoolnix emerged successfully.
So i guess, that "eselect" step should be added to libboost ebuild

There's already such step - it's activated by 'eselect'
useflag, which is on by default.
More likely is that something went wrong for you
during boost upgrade/unmerge.
