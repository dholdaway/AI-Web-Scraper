 Inside Lockheed Martin Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
However, if a government shutdown were to occur and were to continue for an extended period, we could be at risk of reduced orders, program cancellations, schedule delays, production halts and other disruptions and nonpayment, which could adversely affect our results of operations.



 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
Future transactions could result in a noncash settlement charge to earnings, which could be material to a reporting period.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
Future pension risk transfer transactions could be significant and result in us making additional contributions to the pension trust and/or require us to recognize noncash, non-operating pension settlement charges in earnings in the applicable reporting period.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions could have a material effect on the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.
