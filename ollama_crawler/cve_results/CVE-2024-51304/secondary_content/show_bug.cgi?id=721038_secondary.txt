Description


Agostino Sarubbo






          2020-05-05 06:31:59 UTC
        

This is an auto-filled bug because media-sound/fluidsynth calls cc directly.
The issue was originally discovered on arm64, but it may be reproducible on other arches as well.
If you think that a different summary clarifies the issue better, feel free to change it.
Attached build log and emerge --info.

NOTE:
If you think it doesn't make sense fix these type of issues, I'd like to point out that won't be possible use a different CC implementation (like clang) by setting the CC variable. So this issue has been reproduced by setting the CC variable to aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc and by removing the /usr/bin/cc - /usr/bin/gcc binaries.

Can't reproduce, even with USE="-native-symlinks".
