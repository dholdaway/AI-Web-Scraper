I have some scripts ported from the Ubuntu package macbook-hal-device which creates a HAL profile for the Macbook/Macbook Pro's so that gnome-power-manager can control the backlight, which is nice for Gnome users.

I think it would be useful to include either into this ebuild, or possibly another one.

(this is an automated message based on filtering criteria that matched this bug)
'EBUILD' is in the KEYWORDS which should mean that there is a ebuild attached 
to this bug.
This bug is assigned to maintainer-wanted which means that it is not in the 
main tree.
Heuristics show that no Gentoo developer has commented on your ebuild.

Hello, The Gentoo Team would like to firstly thank you for your ebuild 
submission. We also apologize for not being able to accommodate you in a timely
manner. There are simply too many new packages.

Allow me to use this opportunity to introduce you to Gentoo Sunrise. The 
sunrise overlay[1] is a overlay for Gentoo which we allow trusted users to 
commit to and all users can have ebuilds reviewed by Gentoo devs for entry 
into the overlay. So, the sunrise team is suggesting that you look into this 
and submit your ebuild to the overlay where even *you* can commit to. =)

Because this is a mass message, we are also asking you to be patient with us. 
We anticipate a large number of requests in a short time. 

Thanks,
On behalf of the Gentoo Sunrise Team,
Jeremy.

With today's kernels backlight works without that tool out of the box.
