$ quake4-smp 
/usr/games/bin/quake4-smp: line 10: /opt/quake4/quake4smp.x86: No such file or directory
/usr/games/bin/quake4-smp: line 10: /opt/quake4/quake4smp.x86: Success


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. USE=cdinstall emerge games-fps/quake4-bin
2. accept all licenses
3. quake4-smp

Actual Results:  
I originally was using the no-multilib profile, but switched so i could play quake. I re-emerged any packages that had new useflags. I proceded to install quake4-bin and its emul dependancies. The game will not run.

Expected Results:  
murder, mayhem, death, and destruction.... the game to run.

OK.  It runs fine here.  Did you not enable IA32 emulation in your kernel?

i need to re-test this. i had switched from a non-multilib to multilib profile, not knowing that you cannot just "flip-flop" them. i've since re-installed but have not tried to re-install quake 3 or 4 yet.
