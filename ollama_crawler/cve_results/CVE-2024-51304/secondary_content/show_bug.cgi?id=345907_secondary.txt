Description

Updating from postfix-2.6.6 to postfix-2.7.1, etc-update wants to change the following master.cf line:

smtps     inet  n       -       n       -       -       smtpd

to this:

smtps     inet  n       -       n       -       -       smtp

Which I have verified is incorrect.

Reproducible: Always

I don't think the ebuild is at fault here because it doesn't alter that config file other than changing /usr/local to /usr.

In a fresh config, the smtps line is correct and commented out so perhaps etc-update is what is causing the problem..

Could you please make sure that you didn't confuse the old/new output from etc-update? That's the only way I could explain this.

Is there a way I can get etc-update to try and change master.cf again?

Well, you could revert the change and re-emerge postfix-2.7.1. Unfortunately, "revert" implies that you know in which direction the change occurred, and that's what I'd like to test.

I've personally already tried sticking,

  smtps     inet  n       -       n       -       -       smtpd

into a master.cf and emerging postfix-2.7.1. Everything works as expected in that case.

I triple-checked when I first noticed the issue but it sounds like I must have made a mistake.  Please close the bug if you agree.  I'll reopen if I come across it again.  Thanks.

Closing as worksforme. Please reopen if you can reproduce the problem.
