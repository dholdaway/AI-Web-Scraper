When using bugs.gentoo.org from our university pool, I'm now required to re-login very often (somewhere between every 1-3 pages). This wasn't always the case. Cookies are still enabled and I can see they're set.
I noticed the "Restrict session to this IP address" option has gone. Is it always on now, by any chance? I'm forced to use a proxy, so it could be a problem regarding changing source IP addresses.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. login to bugs.gentoo.org
2. browse bugs
3. try to file a bug report
4. login again
5. continue filing a bug report
6. login again
...

Actual Results:  
s.a.


Expected Results:  
Only require me to login once per session (or even better, once per month :) ).

I can only assume it is a problem with your proxy. What browser/OS are you
using? I have never seen this issue before

Closing as I've installed a new bugzilla version and not heard anything since.
