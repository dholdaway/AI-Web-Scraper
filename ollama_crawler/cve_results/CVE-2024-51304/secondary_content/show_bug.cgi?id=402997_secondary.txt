After playing many videos on youtube/vimeo/dailymotion, sometimes, sound playback stops working for good (I have to restart chromium).

Please make the steps as precise as possible. Is it reproducible every time after launching the browser? What sound server are you using, with what configuration? Approximately how long does it take since launch for sound to "break"?

What can I say is I don't have a sound server, it is straight alsa with the dmix plugin. The hard part, I was not able to find a pattern to reproduce. It did happen several times though. It seems to happen with a long browser session viewing many videos from youtube/vimeo.

When it happens, could you try killing the flash plugin, and reloading the page?

To kill the flash plugin:
 1) click the spanner > view background pages.
 2) choose the flash plugin.
 3) click end process.

Sometimes changing video quality help get back sound on html5 player.

Can anyone reproduce the issue using www-client/google-chrome?

I'm afraid we need more precise steps to reproduce here to do anything. :-/

Have you tried the solution from https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=402997#c3 ?
