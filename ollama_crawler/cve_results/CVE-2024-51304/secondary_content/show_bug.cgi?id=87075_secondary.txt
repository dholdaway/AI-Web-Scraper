When I try to sign a key I get gpgme errors:

the gpgme library returned an unexpected error. The error was

general error. Turning on gpgme debuggin gives the attached gpgmelog.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. right click on an unsigned key
2. choose sign key
3.

Actual Results:  
error - then nothing

Expected Results:  
Sign the key

I have this problem too. Downgrading gpg-me and gpa gave not success. In the end, I tried to downgrade gnupg from 1.4.1 to 1.2.6 and it worked.

What is the dependence?

gpa and gpgme is already at the latest version and there are no other masked versions.
