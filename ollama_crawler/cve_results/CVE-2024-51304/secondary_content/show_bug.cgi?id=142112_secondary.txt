Most recent stable ebuild of app-i18n/scim is 1.4.4
And the only ebuild of scim-cvs is 1.3.3 and masked.
Is this ebuild there for any reason??? For me, it just seems to be a garbage

Well, it's not masked and it's CVS ebuild, so it definitely won't be keyworded stable, ever. Noone's forcing you to use it, so... what's your point here?
