Hello,
It would be a great enhancement to net-misc/wget to prefer ipv6 when installed with USE=ipv6 in wgetrc at install time. Could probably be a simple sed: "sed -i -e 's:#prefer:prefer:' ${D}/etc/wgetrc" or so.

Thanks for your consideration.

this is the point of the wgetrc fragment in FILESDIR.  if you want to tweak that better, feel free.  it only gets added when USE=ipv6.

Oh. So it would be acceptable to simply change the fragment so that it is not commented by default? I feel like if people have the ipv6 flag enabled, then they would /prefer/ ipv6 routes by default, without changing the config file.

that assumption seems reasonable to me, so feel free to make that change as well as anything else you feel enhances the default USE=ipv6 experience (without breaking ipv4 support).

Nevermind, I tested some more and wget will prefer ipv6 if you system supports it regardless of this setting in wgetrc and does the right thing if you have wget[ipv6] on a ipv4 host with this setting commented out.
