amarok ebuilds define dependencies like this:
  RDEPEND="some_dependencies"
  DEPEND="${RDEPEND}"
  RDEPEND="${RDEPEND}
    more_dependencies"
It seems equivalent to:
  DEPEND="some_dependencies"
  RDEPEND="${DEPEND}
    more_dependencies"
which is cleaner and easier to understand. If I'm not missing something that would make the first option better, could someone please change this?

You are apparently bored, right? Please, stop bugging us with non-issues.
:S

From time to time there has been build-only dependencies, and this format stuck for that ebuild, I'm not going to change it right now, it works for me.
