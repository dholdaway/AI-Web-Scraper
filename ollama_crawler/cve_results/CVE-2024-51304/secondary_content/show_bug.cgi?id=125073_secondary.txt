First :

sunultra5 ~ # uname -a
Linux sunultra5 2.4.32-sparc #1 SMP Tue Jan 3 21:34:17 CET 2006 sparc64 sun4u TI UltraSparc IIi (Sabre) GNU/Linux

Here is my problem.

I have a working Sun Space Ultra 5 station working with gentoo 2005.1 since 4 mont and while trying to upgrade to 2006.0 here is what I got.

I change my profile to point to :

sunultra5 ~ # ls -al /etc/make.profile
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root 58 Mar  3 21:51 /etc/make.profile -> ../usr/portage/profiles/default-linux/sparc/sparc64/2006.0

After I did and emerge --sync everything was good, but when I tried to do a emerge -ua world here is what I got :

sunultra5 ~ # emerge -ua world

These are the packages that I would merge, in order:

Calculating world dependencies /
!!! All ebuilds that could satisfy "sys-kernel/gentoo-sources" have been masked.

- sys-kernel/gentoo-sources-2.6.14-r5 (masked by: missing keyword)

For more information, see MASKED PACKAGES section in the emerge man page or
refer to the Gentoo Handbook.
!!!    (dependency required by "media-libs/alsa-lib-1.0.10" [ebuild])



!!! Problem resolving dependencies for gnome-base/gnome
!!! Depgraph creation failed.


I don't know what to do.
