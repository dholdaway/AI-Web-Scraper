Lists subkeys.pgp.net as the location for the GPG signing keys however none of the keys listed can be downloaded from there:

These keys are still valid and I was able to get them from the subkeys.pgp.net server on a 2nd try here on my laptop and on the first try on my server.

pub   4096R/96D8BF6D 2011-11-25 [expires: 2015-11-24]

The following keys were expired or revoked, but do show up as well.

pub   1024D/239C75C4 2007-11-25 [expired: 2012-05-23]
uid                  Gentoo Portage Snapshot Signing Key (Automated Signing Key)

pub   1024D/D8BA32AA 2004-11-11 [revoked: 2007-11-25]
uid                  Gentoo Portage Snapshot Signing Key (Automated Signing Key)

pub   1024D/7DDAD20D 2005-11-23 [revoked: 2007-11-25]
uid                  Gentoo Portage Snapshot Signing Key (Automated Signing Key)


I'm closing as WORKSFORME. If you have trouble fetching the keys again, please leave a comment here.

subkeys.pgp.net is a static pool, that I currently see returning 3 servers of which only one is active and syncronizing. 

116.240.198.71 - nonresponsive 
223.252.21.101 - OK
195.113.19.83 - nonresponsive

I recommend using pool.sks-keyservers.net as an alternative on the releng website (and other places)
