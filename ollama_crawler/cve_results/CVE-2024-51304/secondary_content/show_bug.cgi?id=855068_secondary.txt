Seeing the hang on:
>intrupt
is concerning.

I've had some weirdness on SPARC with signals before (e.g. CTRL-Z leads to "interrupted system call" with emerge).

This does not repro for me unfortunately, tried 4.34 and 4.34.1.  Still passes on -O3 -mcpu=native (niagara4).  Could I get a retest on this?  Maybe try outside of container if it is still present?

I can't reproduce. Also had -mcpu=niagara4

For me, it seems to run very very slowly, but not hanging. Which is bizarre given matoro and rich can run it pretty quickly. I've been running it for about 3 hours and it's still not done.
