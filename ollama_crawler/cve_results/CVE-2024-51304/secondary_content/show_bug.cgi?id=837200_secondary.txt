Here is a link to the bug report I filed on kicad's gitlab:
https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/11348

Basically, all the default libraries are installed to /usr/share/kicad like they're supposed to, but none of the default libraries are imported. I still have to manually import them all. Also, When I go to import them, it defaults to looking in $HOME/.local/share/kicad/6.0/symbols.

There is more information in the bug report on their gitlab. I was told to report this here.

When starting KiCad 6.X series for the fist time it will ask whether you want to use the default table, create a new one, or import old tables for your symbols and footprints.

Later invocations of KiCad just load the proper symbol/footprint tables.

Could you try starting KiCad without a configuration (e.g. backup/move your current ~/.config/kicad directory and see if it still does not work?

Sorry for leaving this for so long. I recently had to reinstall gentoo and as a result I reinstalled KiCad and I didn't have this issue.
