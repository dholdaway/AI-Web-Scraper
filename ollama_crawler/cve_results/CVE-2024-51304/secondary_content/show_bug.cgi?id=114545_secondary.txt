Hi, I recently upgraded to  the latest modular ebuild, in the hope the xv  
extension would work now. Unfortunately the xorgs.log still tells me, xv is  
loaded, while xvinfo doesn't find an an adapter. 
 
There was an bug on feedesktop.org, but since I doesn't find it now, I think 
it's fixed there. 
 
I have an savage-card, if this matter. 

Reproducible: Always

It might matter since it works on my Intel card...

When did you upgrade? RC3 was put into the tree yesterday.

I upgraded yesterday/today,  my system is up to date now.  
  
xorg-x11 is 7.0.0_rc3 now,  
x11-drivers/xf86-video-savage is 2.0.2.1   
  
libXv is also updated. Still no xv.  
 
P.S 
Xorg-server, libxvmc, was not upgraded with emerge -D world. Emerge manually 
now

If this still isn't working in 7.0 final, please attach xorg.conf and Xorg.0.log, and post 'emerge info'.
