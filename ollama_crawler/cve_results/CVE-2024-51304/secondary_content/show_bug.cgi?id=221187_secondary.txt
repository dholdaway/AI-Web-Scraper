Description

So I installed PHPMyAdmin through Portage, just to keep it up-to-date with the latest. Sadly, after installing it, when trying 'cookie' authentification, it shown a 'Save File Dialog' for the index.php file. Also, the 'sql.php' file, when you execute SQLs does the same.
The problem is solved if you go to the official PHPMyAdmin page and download an archive and untar/gz it. So, there's actually a difference in how PHPMyAdmin from Gentoo and the official PHPMyAdmin archives behave, ON THE SAME DEFAULT PHP SETUP.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install PHPMyAdmin through Portage. Use webappconfig from Gentoo to install it.
2. Have a default Apache2/PHP instalation.
3. Try cookie auth, or try to do an SQL execution. It will shou you a save file dialog.




Hope everything I wrote helps you.

Can't reproduce with phpmyadmin-2.11.8. Please reopen with more specific instructions on how to reproduce the error. I'd suggest attaching your phpmyadmin config file.
