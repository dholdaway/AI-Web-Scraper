Description

sshguard init script is broken, the package works but it needs the init script completely reworked.  --background flag must be removed, and /var/log/auth.log does not exist.  its parent website claims support for metalog and syslog-ng, neither produced said file, upstreams configs reference this file also.  it fails to /etc/init.d/sshguard start out of the box.............

This package could use a note telling people that it won't start until they set a proper log path, but I don't know that any more action than that is needed.  

Many people do have their logger configured to produce /var/log/auth.log, some of the syslog-ng examples still reference this file.  See /usr/share/doc/syslog-ng-*/syslog-ng.conf.doc.bz2 for example.  There is no preset log path that's going to work for everyone, I think it just needs to be made clear that user action is absolutely required here.

Why this change is needed? Can you explain?

It is one of the default log files when you using sysklogd or syslog-ng(not sure about metalog though). So, possibly, this is problem in your configuration.
