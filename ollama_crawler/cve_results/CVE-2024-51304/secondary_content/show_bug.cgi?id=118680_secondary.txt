Description

configure: error: Package requirements (pygtk-2.0 >= 2.4.0) were not met.
Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
installed software in a non-standard prefix.

Alternatively you may set the PYGTK_CFLAGS and PYGTK_LIBS environment variables
to avoid the need to call pkg-config.  See the pkg-config man page for
more details.

!!! Please attach the config.log to your bug report:
!!! /mnt/storage/gentoo/tmp/portage/gnome-python-extras-2.10.2/work/gnome-python-extras-2.10.2/config.log

!!! ERROR: dev-python/gnome-python-extras-2.10.2 failed.
!!! Function econf, Line 495, Exitcode 0
!!! econf failed
!!! If you need support, post the topmost build error, NOT this status message.
