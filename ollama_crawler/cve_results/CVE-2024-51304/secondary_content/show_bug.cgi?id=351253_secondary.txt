media-sound/audacity-1.3.12 tends to stop recording after some seconds or 10s of seconds when I try to record 2 or more tracks. It starts tu consume as much CPU time as possible (usually about 80%) and do nothing. I can still press the "Stop" button and it gets out of this state, but the amount of data between it stopped refreshing the volume level indicators and pressing the "Stop" button by me is lost.
  I tried to start Audacity from the terminal to see if there are some error messages in such cases, but there is none.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Audacity and press "Record" button. Record some seconds or minutes of sound.
2. Press "Stop" and then press "Record" again. Wait for some seconds or a minute.
3. When it stops refreshing the indicators, press "Stop" button and check if you still can control the application.

Actual Results:  
The recording process stops at some point and starts to consume too much CPU time.

Expected Results:  
It should record as many tracks as needed since there is such a functionality in the application by design.

Please read the Gentoo Bug Reporting Guide[1] before opening a bug. This bug does not qualify as a "critical" bug.

  I have read this guide long ago, thank you. But I have also read the short descriptions near the different bug severity levels. There is the following:
"Critical: The softwae crashes, hangs or causes you to lose data."
The bug I reported does indeed cause me to lose data. Like I have said in the starting post, Audacity stops recording at some point and when I press "Stop", I can see that all the signal from that point is lost.
  Now imagine I'm trying to record some song with my friends. I push "Record" and go to my instrument to play some music or to the microphone to sing something. After we have played the entire song, I come back to my PC and see that we had recorded almost nothig. Doesn't it qualify as a "data loss"?
  If it doesn't than please excuse me for my mistake. I hope you understand my point.
  Anyway thank you for an attention to my report. :)

Closing since I can't reproduce this with 1.3.13. If you can reproduce it feel free to reopen, but in that case you should probably open an upstream bug as well and link to it here.
