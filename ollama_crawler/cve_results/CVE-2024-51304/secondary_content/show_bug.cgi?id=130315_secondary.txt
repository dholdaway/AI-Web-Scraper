'Due to a recent change on the Microsoft servers, everyone running version 0.95 or earlier will get an "Invalid username / password" error message if they try to connect over port 80 or with a proxy [*]. If you get hit by this issue, please download the latest CVS snapshot from http://amsn.sourceforge.net/amsn_cvs.tar.gz and install it :'
