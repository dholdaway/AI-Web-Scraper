Jack-racks file open/save dialogs dont work when compiled without gnome use-flag

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.disable gnome use-flag
2.emerge media-sound/jack-rack
3.

Actual Results:  
file handle dialog doesnt let you pick files or browse directories


Simple solution would be to make gnome a unconditional dependency and remove the use-flag.

Works for me using media-sound/jack-rack-1.4.8_rc1 and USE="-gnome". Maybe this bug relates to an old version?
