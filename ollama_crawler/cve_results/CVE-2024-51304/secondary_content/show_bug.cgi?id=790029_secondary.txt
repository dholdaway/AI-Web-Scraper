After switch to ~amd64 and doing 'emerge --ask --update --newuse --with-bdeps=y --deep @world'.

checking whether the C compiler works...  * /tmp/portage/sys-apps/sandbox-2.22/work/sandbox-2.22/libsandbox/trace.c:_do_ptrace():83: failure (Operation not permitted):
 * ISE:_do_ptrace: ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME, ..., 0x0000000000000000, 0x0000000000000000): Operation not permitted

Reproducible: Always

it's upstream? sandbox just protect us?! but why ncurses from amd64 to ~amd64 need ptrace in the newer version?

Note that sandbox *always* needs the ability to use ptrace, even if it doesn't always make use of that ability.

Do not use random sysctls to disable it.

Anyway, the full build.log, emerge --info, and sandbox log is needed.

Sorry i forgot about sysctl 'kernel.yama.ptrace_scope=2'

The current stable version of ncurses (sys-libs/ncurses-6.2-r1) work even with ptrace_scope=2.
