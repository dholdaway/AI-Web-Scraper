Description


José Romildo Malaquias





          2014-08-06 09:56:16 UTC
        

When trying to emerge x11-misc/sddm-9999::qt I am getting the error messages:

# emerge -avt sddm                           
These are the packages that would be merged, in reverse order:
Calculating dependencies... done!
emerge: there are no ebuilds to satisfy "sys-auth/qauth[qt5(-)]".
(dependency required by "x11-misc/sddm-9999::qt" [ebuild])
(dependency required by "sddm" [argument])

Try unmasking the qt5 USE flag: echo -qt5 >> /etc/portage/profile/use.mask

The dependency looks correct to me. It's probably what kensington said: the qt5 USE flag is masked on the reporter's system.
