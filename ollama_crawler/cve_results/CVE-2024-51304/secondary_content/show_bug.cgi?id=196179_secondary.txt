Description

When I start X, Xorg.0.log includes probed modelines, as follows:

(II) fglrx(0): Total of 13 modes found for primary display.
(--) fglrx(0): Virtual size is 1280x800 (pitch 0)
(**) fglrx(0): *Mode "1280x800": 71.2 MHz (scaled from 0.0 MHz), 49.5 kHz, 60.0 Hz
(II) fglrx(0): Modeline "1280x800"   71.25  1280 1328 1360 1440  800 802 808 823
[...]

However, when I enter the XFCE display settings, the highest resolution listed there is 1024x768. When I select default in the display settings, it goes to 1280 800 (which is good)... but shouldn't this be listed?

I'm using XFCE on Gentoo with the fglrx driver.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start an XFCE session
2. Right-click on the desktop and select Display Settings
3. Not all probed modes are there?

Default is whatever your default is in xorg.conf; if you dislike this, then you need ask at http://bugzilla.xfce.org/, not here. Also, Xfce only uses xrandr to set resolution and detecting correct ones is Xorg server job.

List in Display Settings should be same as in 'xrandr' which is correct behavior, if you don't like this, open a bug at http://bugs.freedesktop.org, against X.org product.

It seems the output from xrandr and the settings list do not match. xrandr gives:

Screen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1280 x 800, maximum 1280 x 800
default connected 1280x800+0+0 0mm x 0mm
   1280x800       60.0* 
   1024x768       60.0  
   848x480        60.0  
   800x600        60.0  
   720x576        60.0  
   720x480        60.0  
   640x480        60.0  
   640x400        60.0  
   640x350        60.0  
   512x384        60.0  
   400x300        60.0  
   320x240        60.0  
   320x200        60.0  

Functionally, selecting "default" does select 1280x800, but this mode is not explicitly listed in the settings list.

So should I open a bug in the xfce tracker?

So your default is 1280x800.. So where is the problem?

The problem is that the casual user who doesn't know how to use xrandr, xorg.conf, etc. doesn't know what the default is. It isn't "Default (1280x800)", it's just "Default". And the user can't explicitly pick 1280x800 either.
