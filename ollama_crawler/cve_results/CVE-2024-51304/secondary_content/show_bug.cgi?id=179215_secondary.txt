Description

The patch I submitted upstream at http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1667898&group_id=943&atid=300943 fixes a 64-bit bug, which manifests as a segfault on startup when running xfte.

Upstream seems to be unmaintained, so I'm submitting this for inclusion in an ebuild.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Get a Core2Duo (for some reason never occurred on my Athlon64)
2.Run xfte

Actual Results:  
A segfault (I can probably reproduce a backtrace if it's important, but currently I'm running with the patch).

Expected Results:  
No segfault.

Could you post a full traceback? I can't reproduce on my core2, and I suspect that's not a proper fix anyway. Thanks in advance (and I'm sorry it took too much time for anyone to reply).

Here's the backtrace, produced by hacking the ebuild for fte-20051115-r1 to set OPTIMIZE to -g instead of empty, and building with FEATURES=nostrip. I no longer use fte by the way.

Works for me as well on amd64 host. Obviously, something is weird on your setup compared to ours. Since you don't use fte anymore, I guess we can close this bug (because no one else has commented or added to CC) Thanks for responding again and sorry.
