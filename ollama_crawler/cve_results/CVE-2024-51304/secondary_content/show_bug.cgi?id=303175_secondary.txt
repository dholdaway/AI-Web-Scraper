Description

After installing www-client/mozilla-thunderbird-3.6-r1, I experienced
crashes on multiple occasions, like trying to subscribe to an rss feed
or sometimes even after saving a bookmark, with a segfault. Sometimes
firefox won't even run again after such a crash, giving no error message.
Deleting ~/.mozilla lets me run firefox again, but it will still crash
on the occasions mentioned above and many others, rendering it unusable.

Downgrading to www-client/mozilla-thunderbird-3.5.7 didn't change the problem,
although that version was working before. Switching to firefox-bin also does
not help.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Firefox

2a. Try to subscribe to any rss feed
3a. Segfault

2b. Try to login to gmail
3b. Segfault

Actual Results:  
Segfault

Expected Results:  
Subscribe to an rss feed or Getting redirected to the gmail account.

strace

This is the output of strace firefox. I set xkcd.com as my home page before and just clicked the rss icon inside the address field. Then firefox crashed.

Try to start firefox from command line. Is there any  useful output there? If not try to build firefox with debugging symbols enabled and get backtrace.

http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/qa/backtraces.xml

Assigning on maintainers as probably they can suggest more.

backtrace

I merged firefox with debug useflag and -ggdb added to CFLAGS. Now firefox
crashed without even showing a window. Backtrace attached.

stderr output

This is the output on stderr for firefox with debug symbols (crashing instantly,
as stated before).

Playing around with the USE-flags showed that removing the gnome flag from xulrunner makes firefox work fine again. It looks like there's something wrong with gnome then; and changing my X session to gnome reveals that gnome also crashes instantly. I guess it's time to open another bug report then.

It is time to run a revdep-rebuild, you most likely have upgraded part of gnome without ensuring linking is consistent. If you can reproduce after a revdep-rebuild we will begin to look at this, feel free to reopen after you have run a revdep-rebuild.

I've experienced the same issue with mozilla-firefox-3.6-r2. revdep-rebuild, rebuilding xulrunner and nss didn't help. Analyzing the libraries opened by firefox with strace, I've discovered that it was loading a library from /opt (I had firefox-bin installed there). Uninstalling firefox-bin fixed my issues.

I have just changed firefox-bin around, the libs it provides will not be found anymore by a standard mozilla-firefox install.
