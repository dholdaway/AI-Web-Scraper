Description


Michael Brown





          2010-06-28 16:09:51 UTC
        

Whenever I compile a program using i686-mingw32-g++ (emerged by sys-devel/crossdev-0.9.18-r10) and link it, if I attempt to run it in wine, I get an error stating that it could not find libgcc_s_sjlj-1.dll. I attempted to locate this file, but it is nowhere to be found. If the program is compiled with the -static-libgcc flag, it works. Here is some output:

michael@hastur gcctest % i686-mingw32-g++ test.cpp -o test.exe
michael@hastur gcctest % wine test.exe
err:module:import_dll Library libgcc_s_sjlj-1.dll (which is needed by L"Z:\\home\\michael\\development\\gcctest\\test.exe") not found
err:module:LdrInitializeThunk Main exe initialization for L"Z:\\home\\michael\\development\\gcctest\\test.exe" failed, status c0000135
michael@hastur gcctest % i686-mingw32-g++ -static-libgcc test.cpp -o test.exe
michael@hastur gcctest % wine test.exe                                       
test
michael@hastur gcctest % 

-----------------------------------

I cannot redistribute my programs if I do not have libgcc_s_sjlj-1.dll.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Compile any c++ program using i686-mingw32-g++ without -static-libgcc
2. Run program using wine

Actual Results:  
Error is produced.

Expected Results:  
Either required DLL is easy to be found, or is located in proper directory so the error is not generated.

works fine for me

$ qlist -e cross-mingw32/gcc | grep dll
/usr/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/mingw32/gcc-bin/4.4.4/libgcc_s_sjlj-1.dll
