This is a fatal error of an ebuild versions of autoconf >= 2.53 (like anything recent).  Old versions of autoconf should work.

'emerge xvattr' gives the following error:

!!! ERROR: media-video/xvattr-1.3-r1 failed.
Call stack:
  ebuild.sh, line 1539:   Called dyn_unpack
  ebuild.sh, line 711:   Called src_unpack
  xvattr-1.3-r1.ebuild, line 35:   Called eautoreconf
  autotools.eclass, line 62:   Called eautoconf
  autotools.eclass, line 132:   Called autotools_run_tool 'autoconf'
  autotools.eclass, line 188:   Called die

!!! Failed Running autoconf !
!!! If you need support, post the topmost build error, and the call stack if relevant.

The contents of the file '/var/tmp/portage/xvattr-1.3-r1/temp/autoconf-23449.out' are as follows:

configure.in:10: error: do not use LIBOBJS directly, use AC_LIBOBJ (see section
`AC_LIBOBJ vs LIBOBJS'
      If this token and others are legitimate, please use m4_pattern_allow.
      See the Autoconf documentation.

Works just fine here.

sys-devel/autoconf:  2.13, 2.60
