ST. LOUIS, MO, January 24, 2024  Stifel Financial Corp. (NYSE: SF) today reported net revenues of $1.15 billion for the
three months ended December 31, 2023, compared with $1.12 billion a year ago. Net income available to common shareholders of $153.2 million, or $1.38 per diluted common share, compared with $167.3 million, or $1.43 per diluted

 Inside Stifel Financial Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Debt   Highlight
However, if distributions were to be limited in the future due to the failure of our subsidiaries to comply with the net capital rules or a change in the net capital rules, it could have a material and adverse effect to our company by limiting our operations that require intensive use of capital, such as underwriting or trading activities, or limit our ability to implement our business and growth strategies, pay interest on and repay the principal of our debt, and/or repurchase our common stock.



 Other - Other   Highlight
The measurement of the allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, is based on management’s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Company’s relevant financial assets.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
For example, factors that we consider include changes in lending policies and procedures, business conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements, among others.

 Other - Other   Highlight
The fair value of these investments is subject to a high degree of volatility and may be susceptible to significant fluctuation in the near term, and the differences could be material.
