Description

When attempting to work with new configuration files that currently have a prefix of ._cfg####_, I have a serious amount of difficulty since when I attempt to find the new configuration file for a particular file, I cannot use autocompletion since the numbers get in the way.  If the cfg prefix were turned into a suffix, it would be acceptable.  A good, perhaps even better compromise would be putting the numbers in the suffix and the .cfg_ in the prefix.

Is there a quick code patch that would do that just for my system?

Thanks.

Uhh, are you trying to manage them by hand? There's a tool included with portage called 'etc-update' for doing that. Portage tells you about it at the end of every emerge when there are config files to be updated.

ZOMG... Use etc-update or dispatch-conf.

The naming convention for the files should be irrelevant if you use an appropriate tool.

So, you're saying that Unix shell commands are not an appropriate tool for administering a Unix system?  You Gentoo people are continually being very clueless.  I put up with it, but this is another perfect example.

Let's say etc-update and dispatch-conf are more appropriate. Any way, you should use these tools, they will save you a lot of work.

Oh, and please don't insult people next time. Thanks.
