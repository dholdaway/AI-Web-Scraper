PRIMERICA REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER 2023 RESULTS 
 
Recruiting and licensing momentum drove life-licensed sales force to a record 141,572; up 5% compared to the prior year end 
 
Issued Term Life policies up 12% and total face amount issued up 16% 
 
Investment and Savings Product sales up 13% and ending client asset values up 15%
 
Earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $4.30 increased 9%; return on stockholders’ equity (ROE) was 27.8%
 
Diluted adjusted operating EPS of $4.25 increased 9%; adjusted net operating income return on adjusted stockholders’ equity (ROAE) was 26.9%
 
Duluth, GA, Feb. 13, 2024 – Primerica, Inc. (NYSE: PRI) today announced financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2023.  Total revenues of $726.3 million increased 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Net income of $151.9 million increased 4%, while earnings per diluted share of $4.30 increased 9% compared to the prior year period. 
 
Adjusted operating revenues of $724.3 million increased 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.  Adjusted net operating income of $150.4 million increased 4%, while adjusted operating earnings per diluted share of $4.25 increased 9% compared to the prior year period.
 
Strong recruiting and licensing trends continue to reflect the attractiveness of Primerica’s business model and fuel the growth of its powerful distribution platform that now exceeds 141,500 life-licensed individuals.  The Company’s financial results during the fourth quarter reflected the benefit of a large and stable block of in-force term life insurance policies, higher investment products sales and appreciation of client asset values, while net investment income was higher due to an increase in interest rates and growth in the size of the investment portfolio.  The Company continued to experience pressures in senior health, resulting in a small loss in the segment.
  
“Strong fourth quarter results completed another solid year at Primerica as we continue to meet the growing financial needs of middle-income families,” said Glenn Williams, Chief Executive Officer of Primerica, Inc. “Our expanding sales force plays a crucial role

 Inside Primerica, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
A significant increase in interest rates or credit spreads could result in significant unrealized losses in the value of our invested asset portfolio.



 Other - Other   Highlight
Factors that could cause prospective assumptions to be different from historical experience include but are not limited to changes to our term life product series, economic and societal trends, new pharmaceutical drugs, and the impact of regulatory changes.

 Other - Other   Highlight
The determination of whether the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value involves a high degree of estimation and can be affected by a number of industry and company-specific risk factors that are subject to change over time.

 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
The financial and distribution results of our operations in Canada, as reported in U.S. dollars, are affected by changes in the currency exchange rate.

 Other - Other   Highlight
In addition, the sharp rise in market interest rates during 2022 and further rate increases in 2023 have driven unrealized losses in our investment portfolio, although a sharp decline in market rates during the fourth quarter of 2023 reduced our unrealized losses.
