Not the files I download, but the actual ebuilds have wrong md5sums. The first one on the list is nsplugins, and pretty much all of the other ones that I tried that weren't out of another overlay had the same issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge --sync
2. emerge -uavDN kde-meta

Actual Results:  
>>> Verifying ebuild Manifests...

!!! Digest verification failed:
!!! /usr/portage/kde-base/nsplugins/nsplugins-3.5.7.ebuild
!!! Reason: Failed on MD5 verification
!!! Got: a00cf3a9ed10ef4b2995a370e09f40a5
!!! Expected: 0c16e4def12cff34886c1d8027b307d8


Expected Results:  
I should be using KDE 3.5.7 right now...

Portage is on an xfs partition, and I already checked it for corruption. I synced multiple times during the past few days and nothing has helped. digesting it all myself is not going to happen, because kde-i18n alone took hours to download a crapton of files I'll never use and digest them.

I and many others have been able to update to 3.5.7, therefore, this must be a local problem. Try to sync the tree again and if that doesn't work, try using another mirror.
