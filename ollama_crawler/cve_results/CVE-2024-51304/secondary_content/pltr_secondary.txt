 Inside Palantir Technologies Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
If the respective conflicts continue or worsen, leading to greater disruptions and uncertainty within the technology industry or global economy, our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted.



 Other - Other   Highlight
While the ongoing Russia-Ukraine and Israel conflicts are still evolving and the outcomes remain highly uncertain, we do not expect that resulting challenging macroeconomic conditions will have a material impact on our business or results of operations.

 Other - Other   Highlight
However, our current operations related to Ukraine and Israel are not material to our financial position or results of operations.

 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
However, the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other major foreign currencies (primarily the Euro and GBP) has had, and could in the future have, an unfavorable impact on our revenues and expenses from certain non-U.S. customers or vendors whose contracts are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars.

 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
As a corporation with an international presence, we are subject to risks and uncertainties caused by significant events with macroeconomic impacts, including, but not limited to, geopolitical tensions, heightened interest rates, monetary policy changes, and foreign currency fluctuations.
