Hi, i've noticed, that sun-jre-bin is marked stable in Portage. Is there any way how to add something like sun-jdk-bin? I will be glad to help, at least with testing.

I have a strange feeling, that sun-jdk is compiled version of normally used .bin Java package, provided by Sun. Sorry for misunderstood
