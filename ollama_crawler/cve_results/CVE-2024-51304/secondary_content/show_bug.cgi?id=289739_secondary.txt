Changing options debug=0 to debug=1 in /etc/nagios/nrpe.conf makes nrpe daemon to change behavior. It's start to refuse connection when /etc/hosts.allow is not readble by nagios user.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.# /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_nrpe -H 127.00.0.1 -c check_hda1
DISK CRITICAL - /dev/hda1 is not accessible: Nie ma takiego pliku ani katalogu

Syslog:
localhost nrpe[16077]: warning: cannot open /etc/hosts.allow: Permission denied

2. edit nrpe.conf and set debug=1
3. /etc/init.d/nrpe restart
4. # /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_nrpe -H 127.00.0.1 -c check_hda1
CHECK_NRPE: Error - Could not complete SSL handshake.

Syslog:
localhost nrpe[19945]: Connection from 127.0.0.1 port 21170
localhost nrpe[19945]: Host address is in allowed_hosts
localhost nrpe[19945]: warning: cannot open /etc/hosts.allow: Permission denied
localhost nrpe[19945]: error: bad option name: "Y"
localhost nrpe[19945]: Connection refused by TCP wrapper
localhost nrpe[19945]: refused connect from localhost (127.0.0.1)

Closing.  Old bug, unable to reproduce with nrpe-4.0.x
