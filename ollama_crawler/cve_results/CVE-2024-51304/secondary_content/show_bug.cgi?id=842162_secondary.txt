Description


gentoo

I found that the yajl package installation failed when I installed virt-manager. I checked and found that the download source did not provide the expected resources.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
emerge dev-libs/yajl
Actual Results:  
!!! Fetched file: yajl-2.1.0.tar.gz VERIFY FAILED!
!!! Reason: Filesize does not match recorded size
!!! Got : 105
!!! Expected: 84039


I checked ebuild and found the download source, but I can't post the URL here.
I visited the address and got the result "the given path has multiple possibilities: #<Git::Ref:0x00007efff4521a20>, #<Git::Ref:0x00007efff4520990>".

I found everything to be fine when I tried it today. I guess it's a GitHub bug.
