I use the =sys-devel/gcc-4.6.1 (and later =sys-devel/gcc-4.6.1-r1) compiler version which is still hard-masked for testing.

Almost the whole system compiles fine when using =sys-devel/gcc-4.6.1-r1. The only ebuild that fails to compile is ruby, which is not used/installed any more on my machine since I don't need any ebuild that has ruby as a dependency. Aren't there already patches upstream that fixes the GCC-4.6.1 problem in ruby?

So why is =sys-devel/gcc-4.6* still hard-masked? Are there many other ebuilds that fail to compile when using the GCC 4.6 series?

Once again, please do not CC arches on your own.
