Description


Dan Ost





          2006-02-13 09:47:23 UTC
        

When rsync is run in daemon mode when nfs already running, rsync fails and pops the following into the daemon.log:

rsyncd version 2.6.0 starting, listening on port 873
rsync: open inbound socket on port 873 failed: Address family not supported by protocol
rsync error: error in socket IO (code 10) at socket.c(466)

rsync works fine if I shut down nfs (/etc/init.d/nfs stop).

I found a forum topic that describes the problem at http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-359538.html

Works just fine here. Don't define the same port for two different services, obviously won't work (and no, they don't overlap by default).

I have never adjusted the ports assigned to either service (nfs doesn't even appear in /etc/services). Even stranger, I haven't changed any rsync or nfs configuration for well over a year and yet this problem just appeared mysteriously after a reboot last week (last reboot before that was about 2 months previous).

Is it possible that I'm only seeing this now because of recent changes in baselayout that start nfs before rsync?
