Exhibit 99.1   


 ADM Appoints Ismael Roig Interim Chief Financial Officer 
Vikram Luthar Placed on Administrative Leave  CHICAGO
 January 21, 2024  ADM (NYSE: ADM) today announced the appointment of Ismael Roig as Interim Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Roig is a skilled executive deeply familiar with ADMs business, having served in a variety of
global operational and financial leadership roles since joining the Company in 2004. The appointment follows the decision of the ADM Board of Directors to place Vikram Luthar, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, on administrative
leave, effective immediately.  Mr. Luthars leave is pending an ongoing investigation being conducted by outside counsel for ADM and the
Boards Audit Committee regarding certain accounting practices and procedures with respect to ADMs Nutrition reporting segment, including as related to certain intersegment transactions. ADMs investigation was initiated in response
to its receipt of a voluntary document request by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). ADM is cooperating with the SEC.  The Board
takes these matters very seriously, said Terry Crews, Lead Director. Pending the outcome of the investigation, the Board determined that it was advisable to place Mr. Luthar on administrative leave. The Board will continue to work
in close coordination with ADMs advisors to identify the best path forward and ensure ADMs processes align with financial governance best practices. 
Chair of the Board and CEO Juan Luciano said, We are fortunate to have a leader of Ismaels caliber step into the Chief Financial Officer role on
an interim basis. Having served in various leadership positions at ADM over the past 20 years, as a member of the Executive Council for ten years, and with his global financial and operating experience, Ismael is the right choice to lead the Finance
organization. We appreciate Ismaels willingness to take on the Interim CFO role at this juncture.  Mr. Roig added, I look forward
to working closely with the management team and Board, including the Audit Committee, as we resolve this matter and continue to drive value for our stockholders and customers. 
ADM with the Audit Committees oversight is working with its advisors to complete the investigation expeditiously. ADM will make further announcements
regarding this matter when the Board of Directors approves any course of action for which further disclosure is appropriate.  Fourth Quarter 2023
Conference Call Update  In connection with todays announcement, ADM expects to delay its earnings release and conference call relating to fourth
quarter and full year 2023 financial results, as well as the filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, from its historical schedule. ADM will provide an update on the
timing of its earnings release and Form 10-K filing as soon as practicable.  Update on 2023 Outlook 
ADM now expects to deliver above $6.90 in adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, subject to completion of annual close
processes and related internal controls. The Company also expects to report fourth quarter and full year 2023 operating profit for its AS&O and
