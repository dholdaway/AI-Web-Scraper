The handbook states 1.5gb min. diskspace required. A user on IRC actually took that by word when trying to get a 'first impression' of gentoo in a VM and quickly failed because of a full disk.

I suggest adding the note:

Please note, 1.5 GB is the absolute bare minimum for a stage and portage installation. It highly depends on how you configure your installation, but to actually use any regular tools and services, we recommend at least +10 GB minimum diskspace. (+20 GB for a full-featured graphical desktop)

Below that table.
I am aware that it is an unclear topic, as a working gentoo instalaltion is even possible under 512mb. Personally I am not that picky about numbers so even if it is left like this, fine with me. Just a suggestion.

Reproducible: Sometimes

I've had full systems in under 800MB; most of that being the portage tree. Embedded folks get it down to less than 10MB in some cases; all just depends on necessity. It helps to pick something like reiserfs, since it deals with tiny files much more sensibly than other filesystems.

Anyway, the guide is fine as-is. Thanks for the suggestion, though.
