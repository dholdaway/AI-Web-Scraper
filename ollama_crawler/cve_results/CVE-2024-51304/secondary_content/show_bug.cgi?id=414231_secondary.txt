digiKam fails to show any pictures - all albums appear empty.

When starting digikam from the console, I get the following error messages:

$ digikam
QSqlDatabasePrivate::removeDatabase: connection 'ConnectionTest' is still in use, all queries will cease to work.
digikam(27455): couldn't create slave: "Unable to create io-slave:

The same problem has been reported for other distributions, but the error has was related there to a wrong library version of Marble, see
https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/28124
http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.kde.digikam.devel/61130

I have re-emerged marble and digikam, but the error persists.
My program versions:
digikam-2.5.0
marble-4.8.2
kdebase-kioslaves-4.8.2
kdemultimedia-kioslaves-4.8.2





.


Reproducible: Always

digikam-2.5.0 works again ok after installing the new kde 4.8.3 version.

This probably was a transition problem... rebuilding something would have fixed it, we'll never find out what exactly...
