It seems that rla-es.forja.rediris.es is no longer resolving. I did notice that there is a github repo that LibreOffice uses for their dictionaries that is being updated regularly. It is based off of the rla-es.forja.rediris.es version with many fixes since 2008.

https://extensions.libreoffice.org/extensions/spanish-dictionaries

https://github.com/sbosio/rla-es

Also, it looks as though this was mentioned 6 years ago in this bug report: https://bugs.gentoo.org/413855

Perhaps it's time to move over to the new version?

Oh, I realized that I wasn't using a mirror, so these were only trying to be pulled directly from the site. Although I suppose this still needs to be looked into?

I assume you were referring to the old ebuild? It's really hard to tell since you failed to include basic information like which ebuild you're talking about, which domains fail to resolve for you, and so on. Presumed fixed in 2.3.

My apologies. At the time of my writing the bug 2.3 wasn't in my tree. Glad to see the ebuild was added. Thank you.
