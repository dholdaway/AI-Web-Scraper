Description


Pacho Ramos






          2009-04-03 11:33:02 UTC
        

Currently this is the example:
Code Listing 2.9: Specify your locales

en_US ISO-8859-1
en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
de_DE ISO-8859-1
de_DE@euro ISO-8859-15
_____

I think that it is missing:
de_DE.UTF-8 UTF-8

It's listed in /usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED and, at least es_ES "version", works fine for me

Thanks

Reproducible: Always

No need. We included each listing as an example of the variety of formats, not as a definitive listing of every possible option for every language. There are subtle differences between each entry, which is the important thing to mention.

you might want to add a tip that the full list of possible locales can be shown by running `locale-gen -l -A`.  or not as /etc/locale.gen contains a comment already pointing people to read /usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED.  just a suggestion ;).

I suggested it simply because I think it were needed for setups with utf8 (that seems to be the default now), then, I thought would be better shown in in example
