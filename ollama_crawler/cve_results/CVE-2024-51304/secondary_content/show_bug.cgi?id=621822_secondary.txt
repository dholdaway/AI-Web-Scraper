Problems with media-fonts/source-pro-20170111. 
No Problems with media-fonts/source-pro-20141211. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge =media-fonts/source-pro-20170111
2. print some text in font "Source Sans Pro" to laser printer or cups-pdf

Actual Results:  
Look at the result in source_version_20170111.pdf. Font is wrong and some characters are not there. 

Expected Results:  
Font should look like in source_version_20141211.pdf. 

I use libreoffice-5.3.3.2 or openoffice-4.1.3 to create the document. 
Problems when I print to my network printer HP 3015P or to cups-pdf. 
When I first use the libreoffice method "export to pdf", the pdf file looks correct, but when i send this pdf file to my printer, the result looks bad again.

media-fonts/source-pro-20170111 renders fine for me in 

Libreoffice Version: 5.3.3.2
Build ID: Gentoo official package
CPU Threads: 8; OS Version: Linux 4.9; UI Render: default; VCL: gtk2; Layout Engine: new; 
Locale: en-GB (en_GB.UTF-8); Calc: group

using your files. I guess, the problem is not the font. 

The situation seems to be a bit more complicate and requires some analysis.
We can not help you efficiently via bug tracker. The bug tracker aims rather on specific problems in .ebuilds and less on individual systems. 

I have had very good experience on the gentoo IRC [1] with questions like this. Of course there are also forums and mailing lists [2,3].
I hope you understand, that I will close the bug here therefore and wish you good luck on one of the mentioned channels [4].
Please reopen the ticket in order to provide an indication for an error in the ebuild.

At least the font triggers the bug. 

I made some tests. I wonder that the original HP driver (hplip-3.17.6.run with hp-laserjet_3015-ps.ppd) leads to the problem. I used the same ppd for cups-pdf. 

Now I tested a standard cups driver called "HP Laserjet Series PCL 6 CUPS (en)" and the result is fine. 

I tried the package net-print/gutenprint-5.2.12: 
Another driver called "HP Laserjet P3005 - CUPS+Gutenprint v5.2.12 (en)" works fine too. But I have a "HP Laserjet P3015DN". 

I tried a driver without "P", but it was wrong. The exists another multifunctional printer from HP with the same number. So "HP Laserjet 3015 - CUPS+Gutenprint v5.2.12 (en)" is definitely wrong for my printer. 

I also tired some ppd files from Windows-drivers, but these did not work. Cups give me "Bad ppd file". Example: upd-ps-x64-6.4.1.22169 with psa4deww.cab with hpcu196s.ppd.
