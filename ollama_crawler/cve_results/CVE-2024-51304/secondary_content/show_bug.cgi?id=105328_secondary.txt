Hello,

This kludgy ebuild hardcodes its own version of sys-libs/db, apparently
unnecessarily. Anyway, the problem is that it installs an unpatched 3.2.9
version of db (see files folder of sys-libs/db for patches) and I am not sure
whether this presents a security issue or not.

For example, from patch.3.2.9.1:

+               case DB_LV_NONEXISTENT:
+                       /* Should never happen. */
+                       DB_ASSERT(0);
+                       break;

I just committed a dsniff-2.3-r6.ebuild that fixes the db issue. Please, let me
know if this is a real issue or not.

err, dsniff-2.3-r6 already fixes this

  09 Sep 2005; Marcelo Goes <vanquirius@gentoo.org> +dsniff-2.3-r6.ebuild:
  Made ebuild DEPEND on ~sys-libs/db-3.2.9 instead of building its own copy.

I am just unaware wether db had any pre GLSA security issues.

oh right duh, Marcelo reported this bug :)

considering i dont think we've seen any security reports against sys-libs/db, i
say we just mark this as a WORKSFORME:THANKSMARCELO
