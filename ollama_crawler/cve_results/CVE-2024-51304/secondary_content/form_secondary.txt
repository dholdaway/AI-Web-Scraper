 Inside Formfactor Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Legal - Other   Highlight
We believe that substantially all of our indemnity arrangements provide either for limitations on the maximum potential future payments we could be obligated to make, or for limitations on the types of claims and damages we could be obligated to indemnify, or both.



 Legal - Other   Highlight
Changes in our tax provisions or an increase in our tax liabilities, whether due to changes in applicable laws and regulations, the interpretation or application thereof, or a final determination of tax audits or litigation or agreements, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
Probe Cards—Gross profit and gross margin in the Probe Cards segment decreased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to lower revenues and unfavorable absorption of costs on these lower production volumes, partially offset by lower inventory excess and obsolescence reserves.

 Legal - Other   Highlight
However, it is not possible to determine or reasonably estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification obligations due to the varying terms of such obligations, a lack of history of prior indemnification claims, the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular contractual arrangement and in each potential future claim for indemnification, and the contingency of any potential liabilities upon the occurrence of events that are not reasonably determinable.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily due to lower outstanding debt balances.
