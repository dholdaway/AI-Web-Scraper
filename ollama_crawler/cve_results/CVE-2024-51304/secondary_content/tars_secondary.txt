 Inside Tarsus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year and could be substantial.



 Other - Other   Highlight
We believe the Company is not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the depository institution and the types of accounts we hold, but we will continue to monitor regularly and adjust, if needed, to mitigate risk, including any ongoing or new events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
We may also encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other currently unknown factors that could adversely affect our business.

 Other - Other   Highlight
If we are unable to raise additional capital or enter into such agreements as and when needed, we could be forced to significantly delay, scale back, or discontinue our product development and/or commercialization plans, which would negatively and adversely affect our financial condition.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Recently, the economy has experienced downward pressure, and together with high rates of inflation and energy supply issues experienced in certain regions, war and geopolitical conflicts, have led to regional and/or global macroeconomic challenges, the effects of which may be of an extended duration.
