This patch changes a bunch of memory types that aren't need to be pre-process into shared space by const'ing them.

This reduces approximately 2Mb of RSS space across the Gnome desktop.

It's the patch that's been blogged about like crazy on http://planet.gnome.org and there's a push to intergrate it upstream and intergrate it into distros so here's my request.
