 Inside Digi International Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
Below are reconciliations from GAAP to Non-GAAP information that we feel is important to our business: Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA (In thousands) Reconciliation of Net Income and Net Income per Diluted Share to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share (In thousands, except per share amounts) (1)The tax effect from the above adjustments assumes an estimated effective tax rate of 18.0% for fiscal 2023 and 2022 based on adjusted net income.



 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
In fiscal 2023, our key operating objectives included: continuing to transition to complete solutions with software and service offerings included with our products, as this drives ARR, which provides more predictable and higher margin revenues; and delivering a higher level of services across our businesses.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
These situations could all lead to potential adverse impacts on a wide range of businesses and could disrupt supply chains and impact the businesses of our vendors and customers in ways that could impact our sales.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
As recurring revenue from subscription and cloud monitoring services becomes a greater portion of our overall revenue, delivering at higher gross margins rates than one-time revenue, we expect gross margin rates to expand.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
This increase was primarily the result of growth in higher margin ARR subscription revenues.
