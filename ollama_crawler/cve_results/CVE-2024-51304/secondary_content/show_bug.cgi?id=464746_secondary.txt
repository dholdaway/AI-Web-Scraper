Please attach full build.log (you can compress it with bzip2), also "emerge --info" output. 

Does it always fail with the same error? Does it fail when compiling with MAKEOPTS="-j1"?

Does it build when compiling with "-g1" in C{XX}FLAGS?

For some reason, the thing now compiles perfectly. I will now try to reproduce from a clean chroot, as I suspect a necessary dependency was updated to the correct version between my attempts. Please leave this open until I return with more info asap.

Did a chroot from most recent amd64 stage3 + tree of today, set the desktop profile, only did the basic package.unmasking and package.keywording. Could not reproduce the issue I reported earlier. Closing as RESOLVED/WORKSFORME.
