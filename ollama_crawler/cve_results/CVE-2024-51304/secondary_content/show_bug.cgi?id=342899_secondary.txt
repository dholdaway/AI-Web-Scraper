Description

I would like to get confirmation from other Gnome team member as maybe I am suffering this one since I am running a mixture of current Gnome 2.32 available in tree packages with 2.30, but this is a major problem since causes me to have to clean my home (currently, I have need to move it to a new one and copy most of old config files... and I haven't even found the culprit :-( )



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Put an Audio CD on your drive
2. Nautilus will popup a dialog letting you choose what to do for the disc.
3. Choose copy it with brasero

Actual Results:  
gnome-panel will restart forever and the following is printed in ~/.xsession-errors:

** (gnome-session:18491): DEBUG: GsmAutostartApp: (pid:18592) done (status:0)
** (gnome-session:18491): DEBUG: GsmDBusClient: obj_path=/org/freedesktop/DBus interface=org.freedesktop.DBus method=NameOwnerChanged
** (gnome-session:18491): DEBUG: GsmDBusClient: obj_path=/org/freedesktop/DBus interface=org.freedesktop.DBus method=NameOwnerChanged
** (gnome-session:18491): DEBUG: GsmDBusClient: obj_path=/org/freedesktop/DBus interface=org.freedesktop.DBus method=NameOwnerChanged
** (gnome-session:18491): DEBUG: GsmDBusClient: obj_path=/org/freedesktop/DBus interface=org.freedesktop.DBus method=NameOwnerChanged
** (gnome-session:18491): DEBUG: GsmDBusClient: obj_path=/org/freedesktop/DBus interface=org.freedesktop.DBus method=NameOwnerChanged
** (gnome-session:18491): DEBUG: GsmDBusClient: obj_path=/org/freedesktop/DBus interface=org.freedesktop.DBus method=NameOwnerChanged
** (gnome-session:18491): DEBUG: GsmDBusClient: obj_path=/org/freedesktop/DBus interface=org.freedesktop.DBus method=NameOwnerChanged
** (gnome-session:18491): DEBUG: GsmDBusClient: obj_path=/org/freedesktop/DBus interface=org.freedesktop.DBus method=NameOwnerChanged

My home will get "poluted" and I will have my desktop broken until I find time for a cleanup :-(

Created attachment 252185 [details]
.recently-used.xbel

And the constant crashes are caused by .recently-used.xbel, probably due its cdda related entry

Looks like the problem has disappeared, will close in the future if nobody else is affected by this
