x11-terms/rxvt-unicode-8.3 works with the X11 ressource  
URxvt.shading: 		-18

After upgrading to x11-terms/rxvt-unicode-9.02-r1,
The ressource act as it was "0" and not as the previous version.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge =x11-terms/rxvt-unicode-8.3
2. Use this ~/.Xdefaults for tests :

URxvt.inheritPixmap: 	True
URxvt.shading: 		-18
URxvt.loginShell: 	True
URxvt.tintColor: 	black


3. Reload Xdefaults : 
$ xrdb -load ~/.Xdefaults

4. Check that transparency is applied and the background is whitened
5. upgrade urxvt to 9.02-r1
6. Check that transparency is applied but the background is not whitened anymore.

Actual Results:  
transparency is applied but the background is not whitened anymore.

Expected Results:  
transparency is applied and the background is whitened

This works for me as expected. Can you try with the latest version? If it still does not work for you. Please reopen this bug.
