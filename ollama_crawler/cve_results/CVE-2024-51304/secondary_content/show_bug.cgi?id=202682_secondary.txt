Everytime i can update or install irssi when perlsuid flag is enable in dev-lang/perl the merge process hangs and produce the bugs

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Disable perlsuid flag resolve the problem
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
After this step irssi merged successfully


Maybe ebuild check if that flag is enabled and then disable her?

There's absolutely nothing criticial here, USE=perlsuid is a horrible, unsupported flag.

Maybe add this flag to blacklist?

IIRC these linking errors have shown up in the past with mismatching ithreads USE flags for perl and libperl. Have you build both packages with ithreads enable or disabled?

To clarify, it builds fine here with perl built with perlsuid.

As stated, it compiles with perlsuid for me.
