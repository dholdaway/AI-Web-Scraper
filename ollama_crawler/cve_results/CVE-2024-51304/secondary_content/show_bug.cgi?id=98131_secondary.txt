As per the summary, I have had the amarok 1.2.3 tray icon disappear (yet keep
its space in the tray) and stop responding a couple of times today. No change
from previous runs of amarok when it didn't happen. Amarok runs in the
background without a glitch but I can only kill it and nothing more since the
tray is the only way to control it.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
2.
3.



Expected Results:  
The icon should keep responding to clicks.

Stupid error on my part: the problem has happened like 30% of all amarok runs,
not always.

Confirmed on 1.2.4.
Amarok this time freezed too, on kill -6 I got crash but I wasn't smart enough
to save the backtrace. I will save the next.

Can you bring up the playlist, or play/stop/forward/backward using  
the global shortcut keys?  
Don't know if this is relevant to anything, but there _is_ another way to 
control amarok :-)

I admit I'm a noob here, I didn't even know of the shortcuts. :) On the other
hand I've never had any more crashes or freezes since my last comment. Maybe it
was something in a dependency I have updated, other then that I don't know.

Is still a problem with 1.3.1-r1?

I'm unsure, lately I haven't experienced the problem but it has always been
intermittent. I'd say it's solved, unless some new evidence comes up.

Tell me if you find a way to reproduce this on a consistent way. I just seen 
it one time, and was related to a broken kde installation (as in, I was 
recompiling it).
