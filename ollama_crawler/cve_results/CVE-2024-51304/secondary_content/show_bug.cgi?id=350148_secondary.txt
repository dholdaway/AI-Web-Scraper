Compiling bzr on stable x86 with the python 3.1 interpreter results in a:

#
>>> Source unpacked in /var/tmp/portage/dev-vcs/bzr-2.0.1/work
#
>>> Compiling source in /var/tmp/portage/dev-vcs/bzr-2.0.1/work/bzr-2.0.1 ...
#
python3.1 setup.py build
#
  File "setup.py", line 128
#
    print "Created:", batch_path
#
                   ^
#
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
#
 * ERROR: dev-vcs/bzr-2.0.1 failed:
#
 *   Building failed
#
 *
#
 * Call stack:
#
 *     ebuild.sh, line   56:  Called src_compile
#
 *   environment, line 5295:  Called distutils_src_compile
#
 *   environment, line 1420:  Called die
#
 * The specific snippet of code:
#
 *               "$(PYTHON)" "${setup_file}" "${DISTUTILS_GLOBAL_OPTIONS[@]}" build "$@" || die "Building failed";


When selecting the 2.6 interpreter, it is installed normally.

Can the package depend on and use the 2.6 interpreter specifically?

Reproducible: Always

It's already fixed in >=dev-vcs/bzr-2.1.2. Stabilization of newer version has been requested in bug #346985.
