equery shows the nvidia-glx drivers have been put here: 
equery files nvidia-glx |grep drivers 
/usr/modules/drivers 
/usr/modules/drivers/nvidia_drv.o 
/usr/modules/drivers/nvidia_drv.so 
 
they should have been added to /usr/lib/modules/drivers/ instead 
 
PS: I did see issue #82595, but because the talk is about another directory, 
and the user has incorrect symlink in my opinion, I created a new one 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge media-video/nvidia-glx-1.0.7174-r4  
2. equery files nvidia-glx |grep drivers OR startx 
3.  
  
Actual Results:  
output: 
/usr/modules/drivers   
/usr/modules/drivers/nvidia_drv.o   
/usr/modules/drivers/nvidia_drv.so   

Expected Results:  
output: 
/usr/lib/modules/drivers   
/usr/lib/modules/drivers/nvidia_drv.o   
/usr/lib/modules/drivers/nvidia_drv.so

I have never had a problem with the nvidia-glx drivers. I am using the 2005.0
profile, this is the only thing I can think of that might possible make my
system sufficiently different to Rainmaker's.

I have the line in /etc/portage/package.keywords: media-video/nvidia-glx ~amd64
This is so I always have the latest "testing" package (which as I write this is
the same as the version in question here).

I don't even have a /usr/modules directory on my system, and the two files in
question (nvidia_drv.o and nvidia_drv.so) are in the /usr/lib/modules/drivers
directory as expected. /usr/lib is a real folder, and /usr/lib64 is a symlink to it.

Hope this helps.

Well, in my case it was baselayout which caused troubles with glx. I did a
search, and found this bug to be the best matching in relation to my problems.

It was a completely different problem. There are a few other bugs with the same
problem, # 76990, # 80161, # 82769 etc.

search for "glx". Problem seems to be AMD64 specific.
