net-mail/kolabd-2.1 cannot be installed without this package.

does affect kolab, re-assigning to wrobel therefore.

Anyways, instead of adding a whole build.log please post the relevant parts and 'emerge --info' inline and not as an attachment. Thanks!

Please attach the build log in a readable format.

I have too many bug reports on my system to keep them uncompressed. Sending them in this format is much quicker, and saves space on the server holding them.

Dear Xavian, in order to make the interaction between you and the Gentoo developers more smooth, please do the following:

a) Don't attach error logs in a compressed form unless asked. Messing with external applications outweights any possible gain of saving disk space.

b) When you're asked for some information and the bug status changes to "RESOLVED NEEDINFO", you're expected to provide the requested information *and* click the "reopen" button at the same time.

Thanks.

This might be overkill. It contains all the information related to this bug in one file. And, it's plain text. ;-D

@xavian: Thanks!

From the error message it looks like kerberos support is causing the problem in your case.

By now the specific version you had the problem with has been replaced by a newer cyrus imap version. I tested compiling it with kerberos support but there was no problem. Can you check the newer version and reopen the bug if the problem persists?

I'm sorry  I forgot all about this. It's seems I too have the latest version, and it's compiled with kolab support as well. In fact, I finally got kolabd installed. You must be a very busy many. Just saw your name on another package that I'm ready to upgrade, perl-kolab. So, I guess I will be working with you for some time to come. Kolab will be one of the central applications to my distribution. Be nice to have someone like you onboard. If you wouldn't discussing this further, write me. It would be nice it kolab had a meta package to install everything related to kolab (including horde) in one shot.

I guess I won't be upgrading perl-kolab. I see you have a message there about not mixing it with Gentoo-2.1. I guess that would further support my suggestion for a kolab-meta. Then, mixing would be less of an issue.

Ok, wait a minute here. perl-kolab-2.1 needs cyrus-imapd-2.3.9. So now that I have cyrus-imapd-2.3.12 installed, perl-kolab now has an unmet dependency for cyrus-imapd. So how exactly should I deal with this? Should I reopen this bug based on the unmet or conflicting dependencies? There's definitely a need for a kolab-meta.

I'm not 100% certain if this means that the problem does not persist any longer for you?

That is a different problem. Maybe you should browse a little bit through the forum at http://forum.pardus.de

To be honest: Kolab2/Gentoo-2.1 was an experiment. I always stated that this would never get something like an upgrade path and there are still many problems associated with it.

Nevertheless I did not just do this in order to torture users :) I basically identified the crucial bottlenecks of having Kolab on Gnetoo and I'm confident that these can all be solved with Kolab2/Gentoo-2.2. I have begun active work on this next version about two months ago and the first packages arrived in the tree. It is far from complete yet and will still take a few months. But you can expect that version to be significantly cleaner on Gentoo than the previous one.

You can consider me among your list of testers. Especially on 64bit AMD.
