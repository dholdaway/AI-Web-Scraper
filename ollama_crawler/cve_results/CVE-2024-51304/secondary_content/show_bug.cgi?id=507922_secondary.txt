Description


Jonas Stein

From description it is not clear, what the program does, or what it is good for:

Description:         Spouts silly mad-lib-style porn-like text

And even the README in tar.gz does not explain more:
==
This is the program "sex," a long-time orphaned program on the net.
The original author is unknown and wasn't in the comments in the code.

I've cleaned up a few things, written a manpage, reworked word wrapping, 
and Mikhail Teterin has been kind enough to rewrite my messy Makefile into
something reasonable.
====

It seems the license is wrong too as the ebuild suggests BSD, but the code tells:

/*sex.c*/
/* Original author unknown.  Presumably this is public domain by now.

Reproducible: Always

The text is perfectly clear. Either you know what it means or you find out what it means when you run the program (repeatedly, perhaps, if that's your thing).
