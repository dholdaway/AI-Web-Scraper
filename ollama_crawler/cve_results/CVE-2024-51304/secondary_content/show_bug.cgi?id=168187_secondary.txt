Having gone through a recent re-install for partitioning reasons, I used the quick start guide to cut alot of the cruft that I didn't feel I needed to reread for the 5 or 6th time, although in a few places it came in handy.

It seems to a point the quickstart guide doesn't change much, so it might be handy  to have the quickstart guide linked into the install handbook incase added info may be needed at some point in time (generally for clarification purposes).

We do already link to the networkless handbook, but I don't see a need to link any further to the handbook, as the quick install guide provides the same info in an abbreviated form. It's all you need to know -- this is a guide designed for advanced users who just need to know the order of steps. The guide expects users to already know what they want to do. We also do link to the general documentation index for the rest of the topics not covered in the quick install guide.
