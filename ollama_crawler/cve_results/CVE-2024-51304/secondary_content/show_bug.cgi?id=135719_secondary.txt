Description


Julien Biezemans

When setting routes_br0=( "10.0.0.0/8 via 172.24.1.241" ) within /etc/conf.d/net the route never gets added to the table when restarting the br0 interface.

This seems to be caused by an error in the syntax used by the initscript, forcing the "via" keyword to be replaced by "gw", which is not correct.

Using the following manual line works properly and the routing table is updated as expected:

ip route add 10.0.0.0/8 via 172.24.1.241

Replacing the "via" keyword by "gw" returns the following error:

Error: eithor "to" is duplicate, or "gw" is a garbage.

You negleted to post `emerge --info` so I'm going to assume that you're using baselayout-1.11.x

This issue has been fixed in baselayout-1.12 - re-open if you disagree
