net-misc/wget-1.12 depends on net-dns/libidn.
I does not link agaisnt libidn-0.3.7.
It is OK with libidn-1.15



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:




The missing function is idna_strerror.
According to 
http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=libidn.git;a=blob;f=NEWS;hb=HEAD
this function was introduced in libidn-0.5.6 (released 2004-10-02)

Bug #283653 handles stabilisation of 1.15 and is almost done for all arches. As for 0.3.7, it was removed an aeon ago:

  03 Sep 2005; Daniel Black <dragonheart@gentoo.org> -libidn-0.3.7.ebuild,
  -libidn-0.5.13.ebuild, -libidn-0.5.17.ebuild:
  old version cleanout

which makes me wonder if this bug is valid at all.

indeed.  upstream doesnt even have released tarballs for things older than 1.0.
