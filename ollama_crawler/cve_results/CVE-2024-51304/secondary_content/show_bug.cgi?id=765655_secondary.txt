Description


Helmut Jarausch





          2021-01-16 17:45:04 UTC
        

dev-python/requests-2.25.1 has the following in its setup.py
requires = [
    'chardet>=3.0.2,<5',
    'idna>=2.5,<3',
    'urllib3>=1.21.1,<1.27',
    'certifi>=2017.4.17'

]

but there is no version of dev-python/idna in the tree which satisfies these requirements. And there is no other version of dev-python/requests which can use dev-python/idna provided by the current tree?

Is there a work around?
Thanks for a hint,
Helmut

There's 2.10-r1, no?

dev-python/idna-2.5 < dev-python/idna-2.10 < dev-python/idna-3

Please test with dev-python/idna-2.10-r1
and reopen, if there is still a problem.
