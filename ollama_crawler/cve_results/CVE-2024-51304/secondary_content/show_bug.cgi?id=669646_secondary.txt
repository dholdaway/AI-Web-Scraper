when IWD daemon is used, NM is able to operate fully without wpa_supplicant presence.

So, only when iwd USE is not selected, wpa_supplicant should be required.


Tested on ~amd64.

That's what the current NM ebuilds enforce

    wifi? (
        !iwd? ( >=net-wireless/wpa_supplicant-0.7.3-r3[dbus] )
        iwd? ( net-wireless/iwd )
    )
