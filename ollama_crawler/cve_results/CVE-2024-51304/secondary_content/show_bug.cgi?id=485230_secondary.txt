From ${URL} :

In 2011 the problem with alloca() was not defined as a vulnerability.

http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12671


@maintainer(s): after the bump, in case we need to stabilize the package, please say explicitly if it is ready for the stabilization or not.

I don't understand. Where exactly is the problem ? As far as I can see there is no exploitable bug on Linux (i.e., I have also no crashes with the examples provided in the glibc bug report).

As far as I can tell, upstream said that this isn't a vuln. I'm not sure what to do with this. @security: thoughts?
