Ectopic expression in Hela cells shows that Ott-2c is a transactivator, whereas Mini-Ott fails to transactivate if the octamer motif is in a promotor position next to TATA box. Mini-Ott can repress the transcriptional signal generated by endogenous octamer factors in F9 cells. It seems that Mini-Ott has the potential to serve as a transcriptional modulator for genes regulated by different octamer-binding factors. In situ hybridization reveals that Mini-Ott expression follows the general pattern of other known Ocf-2 transcripts. However, it is absent from the Purkinje cell layer in the cerebellum of adult mice, and strong expression is observed in the developing nasal neuroepithelium and primary spermatids. Differential expression patterns of the Ott-2 transcripts with different transactivation/repression capacities of the encoded proteins may have a specific role in gene expression in the developing nervous system and in adult brain.cell.comShow moreShow lessSave Cite Cited by 87 Related articles All 9 versions  PrivacyTermsHelpAbout ScholarSearch help
