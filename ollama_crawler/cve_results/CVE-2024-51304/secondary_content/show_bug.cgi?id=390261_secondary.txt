As explained here:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=686029
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1289053

Maybe we should finally treeclean this package as all browsers are going away from npapi plugins and the old flash plugin (used in firefox) has native amd64 support

CCing adobe-flash maintainers as the ebuild would need to be adapted

The issue was last confirmed in 2012 and no duplicates were filed. Several maintainers changed the ebuilds and the eclasses it uses have changed as well over the years (notably multilib.eclass).

I can't reproduce it now. Newer versions went stable since this issue was filed. We don't even know yet what caused the issue in these two instances.
