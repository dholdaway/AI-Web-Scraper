I tried to change my password here https://bugs.gentoo.org/userprefs.cgi?tab=account and got 500 Internal Server Error:

The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request.

Please contact the server administrator, webmaster@gentoo.org and inform them of the time the error occurred, and anything you might have done that may have caused the error.

More information about this error may be available in the server error log.

Reproducible: Always

Does your password include any kind of Unicode characters beyond the usual ASCII range?

No. But I just tried again and succeeded.
