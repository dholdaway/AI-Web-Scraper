Since the update to kde-4.5.1 the po2xml utility. But the opposite (xml2pot) is still installed. I also have not been able to find any package that provides po2xml. Has it been moved?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge --unmerge kdesdk-misc
2. emerge =kde-base/kdesdk-misc-4.4.5-r1
3. ls -l /usr/bin/po2xml # <= file exists :-)
4. emerge --unmerge kdesdk-misc
5. emerge =kde-base/kdesdk-misc-4.5.1
6. ls -l /usr/bin/po2xml # <= file not found :-(

You might check again.  I just emerged kde-base/kdesdk-misc-4.5.1 and it appears to be there.

portageq owners / /usr/bin/po2xml
kde-base/kdesdk-misc-4.5.1
        /usr/bin/po2xml

Thanks for the hint! Now I have po2xml utility. The only drawback is that this package produces file collisions with kapptemplate (see below).

And my system is still not able to produce any docbook documents, because some docbook files are missing:

help_cs.docbook:11: warning: failed to load external entity "dtd/kdex.dtd"

Where could I now find out what else it missing now? Any idea how many other things got broken by update to kde-4.5.1?
