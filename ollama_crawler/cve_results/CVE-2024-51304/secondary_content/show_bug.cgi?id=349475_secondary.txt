I had installed KDE-4.5.4 and nouveau-0.0.16_pre20100615 driver.
When i create new user and try to log in i see only black screen and mouse cursor.
This is because kde desktop effects are on by default. To fix it i add next to ~/.kde4/share/config/kwinrc in [Compositing] section:

Enabled=false

Good idea is to make kde desktop effects switch off by default.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install kde-4.5.4 and nouveau driver (i'm using this manual: http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Nouveau)
2. useradd -m testkde
3. passwd testkde
4. /etc/init.d/xdm restart
5. try to log in
only BLACK screen
6. add "Enabled=false" to ~/.kde4/share/config/kwinrc in [Compositing] section
7. /etc/init.d/xdm restart
8. try to log in
Success!

Today nouveau-0.0.16_pre20101010 and xorg-1.9.2 was stablized. It seems new versions of nouveau and/or xorg-server can use opengl compositing, so kde-4.5.4 starts successfully.
