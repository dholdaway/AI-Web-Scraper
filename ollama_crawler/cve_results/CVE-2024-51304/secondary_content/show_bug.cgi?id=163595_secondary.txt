It's difficult to explain by words. It's better to show.
After changing settings of KOrganizer it must redraw the working place. It does but not fully.
The problem disapperars after refreshing it manually.

Reproducible: Always

1/ Please submit such stuff upstream.
2/ Before you do so, kindly make the screenshot with locales set to *English*; Russian stuff won't be appreciated at all.

Strange thing. After changing locale into English the bug disappeared! Changing it back gave nothing. All is working fine now.

Re: 1/
I did so everytime, but now I wanted to know exactly if bugs.kde.org "communicates" with bugs.gentoo.org.
