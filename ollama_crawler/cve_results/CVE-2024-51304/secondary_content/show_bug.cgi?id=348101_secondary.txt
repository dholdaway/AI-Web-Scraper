I think this is wget "check-sertificate" error related problem:

emerge -f --nodeps i18n                                                                                   ... done!

SRC_URI should be changed to "http://download.github.com/svenfuchs-${PN}-v${PV}-0-g8ff0038.tar.gz -> ${PN}-git-${PV}.tgz"

Or we need wget with "AltDNSName-fix" patch.

Which will redirect to the https version of the URL.

This is fixed in wget-1.12-r3. You get this problem because you mix and match stable and unstable keywords.

Sorry about this.

I was using axel in my FETCHCOMMAND & RESUMECOMMAND and when I switched to the "defaults" it fetched okay.
