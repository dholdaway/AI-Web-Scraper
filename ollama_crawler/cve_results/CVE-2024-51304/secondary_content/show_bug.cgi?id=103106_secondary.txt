Description


Alexey Dobriyan





          2005-08-19 22:35:23 UTC
        

After update from -0.9.8 I was going to get YA cross-compiler to play with
Linux kernel. OK,

        # crossdev -s1 -v --target s390-unknown-linux-gnu

After it finished, the only suspicious detail was that libstdc++-v3 was built
too despite "-s1".

Back to kernel:

        $ make allmodconfig
                [complains about system headers] wt ?

gcc --version => 3.4.1-r3 (the version of s390-unknown-linux-gnu just built)

gcc-config returned everything to proper places.

crossdev-0.9.8 built alpha, x86_64, arm, powerpc64, powerpc, sparc64, hppa,
mips, sparc without side-effects. All these farm was built with gcc-3.4.4.

Reproducible: Always

yeah, gcc-3.4.1-r3 does not support cross-compiling at all ... cant say i'm too
interested in fixing it either :p

Any chance crossdev will select 3.4.4? BTW, --g 3.4.4 worked.
