Description

          2013-12-13 23:15:16 UTC
        

The vigra homepage has been moved to github (see URL above).
It the old URLs are still forwarded to the new location,
but the Download-Links to the old releases had to be changed to circumvent this forwarding.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. clean up downloaded vigra files from /usr/portage/distfiles
2. Try to emerge some of the available vigra versions (<= 1.9.0)
Actual Results:  
Fetch fails since old locations no longer exists.

Expected Results:  
Ebuilds should use the new links presented at the website.

Old URL: http://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/vigra/vigra-1.9.0-src.tar.gz
New URL: http://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/vigra-old-versions/vigra-1.9.0-src.tar.gz

Just replace
SRC_URI="http://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/${PN}/${MY_P}.tar.gz"
by
SRC_URI="http://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/${PN}-old-versions/${MY_P}.tar.gz"
within the version <= 1.9.0 ebuilds.

The file is present on the mirrors, no need to clutter up the changelog.
