The stable sci-mathematics/octave-3.0.3 fails to compile against the stable hdf5-1.8.4-r1 with USE="hdf5". Both packages are stable since more than one week, and are not able to work with each other!

Please either:

- really fix bug 275382 and not just closing them
- fix bug 302512
- or hard mask >=sci-libs/hdf5-1.8.4-r1 till sci-mathematics/ocatve-3.2.4 is ready

Since sci-libs/hdf5-1.8.4-r1 is stable, my revdep-rebuild does not finish successfully.


Reproducible: Always

Any chance of a build log with the failure ?

Stabilization request is already filled and our bugzilla reflects state of ~arch, so nothing should should done here. That said, thanks for report, I'll add note about this breakage in stabilization bug and CC teams.
