Description

When I want to start the Mate-Application where I can change the theme and more. It crashes instantly.

By terminal it says:

$ mate-appearance-properties
mate-appearance-properties: /var/tmp/portage/x11-libs/cairo-1.14.8/work/cairo-1.14.8/src/cairo-scaled-font.c:459: _cairo_scaled_glyph_page_destroy: Zusicherung »!scaled_font->cache_frozen« nicht erfüllt.
Abgebrochen

Translated I think its: Assertion failed.

I changed while the Installation the profile, from default/linux/amd64/13.0 to Desktop after problems get Mate to work. It may affected the problems now.


Thanks!

After some investigation, the problem might be that I set Terminus everywhere to bei my Font.

It is sad to read that you have problems with the software. 

It works for me in mate-base/mate-control-center-1.18.1.
Please add your version number in the title.

The situation seems to be a bit more complicate and requires some analysis.
We can not help you efficiently via bug tracker. The bug tracker aims rather on specific problems in .ebuilds and less on individual systems. 

I have had very good experience on the gentoo IRC [1] with questions like this. Of course there are also forums and mailing lists [2,3].
I hope you understand, that I will close the bug here therefore and wish you good luck on one of the mentioned channels [4].
Please reopen the ticket in order to provide an indication for an error in the ebuild.
