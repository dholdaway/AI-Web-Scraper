Description

Probably the 'ip28' use flag should be made global, or at least descriptions should be unified. Here's the 5 different occurences of that use flag in ebuilds:

ip28(sys-kernel/mips-headers): Enables support for SGI Indigo2 Impact R10000 (IP28)
ip28(sys-boot/arcboot): Disables support for SGI Indigo2 Impact R10000 (IP28)
ip28(sys-devel/gcc): Enable building a compiler capable of building a kernel for SGI Indigo2 Impact R10000 (IP28)
ip28(sys-kernel/mips-sources): Enables support for SGI Indigo2 Impact R10000 (IP28)
ip28(sys-devel/gcc-mips64): Enable building a compiler capable of building a kernel for SGI Indigo2 Impact R10000 (IP28)

Thanks.

I can't see anything wrong with the descriptions. 5 ebuilds aren't worth a very specific global keyword.
