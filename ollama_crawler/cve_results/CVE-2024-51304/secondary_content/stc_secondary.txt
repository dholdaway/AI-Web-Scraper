Stewart Reports
Fourth Quarter 2023 Results
 

·Total revenues of $582.2 million ($577.4 million on an adjusted basis)
compared to $655.9 million ($643.2 million on an adjusted basis) in the prior year quarter

   

·Net income of $8.8 million ($16.6 million on an adjusted basis) compared
to $13.3 million ($22.9 million on an adjusted basis) in the prior year quarter 

   

·Diluted EPS of $0.32 ($0.60 on an adjusted basis) compared to prior year
quarter diluted EPS of $0.49 ($0.84 on an adjusted basis)
 
HOUSTON, February 7, 2024 - Stewart
Information Services Corporation (NYSE: STC) today reported net income attributable to Stewart of $8.8 million ($0.32 per diluted share)
for the fourth quarter 2023, compared to $13.3 million ($0.49 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter 2022. On an adjusted basis, Stewart’s
fourth quarter 2023 net income was $16.6 million ($0.60 per diluted share) compared to $22.9 million ($0.84 per diluted share) in the
fourth quarter 2022. Fourth quarter 2023 pretax income before noncontrolling interests was $18.8 million ($29.1 million on an adjusted
basis) compared to pretax income before noncontrolling interests of $20.8 million ($33.3 million on an adjusted basis) for the fourth
quarter 2022.
 
Fourth quarter 2023 results included $4.8 million of pretax net realized
and unrealized gains primarily driven by net unrealized gains on fair value changes of equity securities investments and net gains from
acquisition liability adjustments, offset by $6.4 million of combined office closures and severance expenses. Fourth quarter 2022 results
included $12.7 million of pretax net realized and unrealized gains, primarily composed of net unrealized gains on fair value changes of
equity securities investments and gains related to settlements of company-owned insurance policies, offset by $16.7 million of combined
office closure, severance and regulatory settlement and litigation expenses.
 
“Our fourth quarter results reflect continuing uncertainty in
the real estate market due to the higher interest rate environment coupled with the normal seasonality. Although we are encouraged by
the moderation of interest rates into the mid – 6 percent range during the fourth quarter and into early 2024, we maintain our outlook
that higher interest rates will negatively impact real estate transaction volume in the first half of 2024,” commented Fred Eppinger,
chief executive officer. “We have made excellent progress on our strategic investments during 2023 and will continue to focus on
balancing thoughtful cost discipline with investment in these long-term enterprise initiatives to create a stronger and more resilient
company.”

 Inside Stewart Information Services Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Segment operating revenues decreased $78.6 million, or 14%, compared to the prior year quarter, as a result of transaction volume declines in our direct and agency title operations.



 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Title losses in 2023 decreased $22.5 million, or 22%, compared to 2022, primarily as a result of lower title premiums in 2023.

 Other - Other   Highlight
A 100 basis point change in the loss provisioning percentage, a reasonable scenario based on our historical loss experience, would have increased or decreased our provision for title losses, and affected pretax operating results by approximately $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Interest rates increased further in 2023 as a result of government actions to address the high inflation rate, which started in the late 2022.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Total international revenues decreased $40.3 million, or 24%, in 2023 primarily due to lower transaction volumes in our Canadian and United Kingdom operations compared to the prior year.
