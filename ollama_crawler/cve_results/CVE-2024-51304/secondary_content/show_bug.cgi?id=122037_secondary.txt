Description

There is a KDE enhancement available that allows a user to determine the look and feel to GTK based applications.  By default, the KDE style will be used, but it can be configured to use virtually any theme.

It also adds a KDE Control Center option to configure the GTK style and appearance under KDE for easy configuration.  I have tested this with KDE 3.5.1 and it works like a champ.

RFE is to get this puppy into Portage.

The following needs to be applied for GTK+ 2.8+:

ACK.

Okay.. portage has it re-ordered gtk-engines-qt instead of "gtk-qt-engine" as provided by the tarball.  Sorry.. :(
