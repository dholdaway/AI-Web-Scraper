Description

I'm unsure if this is a modular X problem or not.

startx gives this error:

xterm: error while loading shared libraries: libXaw.so.8: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
xterm: error while loading shared libraries: libXaw.so.8: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
xterm: error while loading shared libraries: libXaw.so.8: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

libXaw is installed and it is version 1.0.1

So re-emerge it or run revdep-rebuild. Reopen if that doesn't help.
