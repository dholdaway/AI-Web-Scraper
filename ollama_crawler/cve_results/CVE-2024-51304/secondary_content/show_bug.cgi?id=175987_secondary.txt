Hi!

On one of my boxen I use the profile mentioned above, and its package.mask contains the lines:

# Ra??l Porcel <armin76@gentoo.org> (03 Apr 2007)
# Unmasking firefox-1.5 for <epiphany-2.16
-=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.5

I could not find this syntax in the devmanual, and paludis gives the following error

Building target list... paludis@1177519285: [QA] In program paludis -pi world:
  ... When performing install action from command line:
  ... When adding install target 'world':
  ... When adding profile directory '/usr/portage/profiles/default-linux/x86/no-nptl/2.4:
  ... When adding profile configuration file '/usr/portage/profiles/default-linux/x86/no-nptl/2.4/package.mask':
  ... No match for '-=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.5*'
paludis@1177519285: [QA] (same context) No match for '-=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.5*'

OTOH, it does not seem to be possible to add a package.unmask file with the line =www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.5*...

Best regards
Christian

Yeah, package.unmask doesn't work on subdirs of profiles. But using - negates the mask.

That was because i was going to mask firefox-1.5, but it turns out that gnome-2.14 depends on it. I'll remove that mask, since it's pretty useless.
