emerge --info

On an up to date ~AMD64 system when I attempt to configure my (PulseAudio) audio devices in the KDE system settings manager I receive the console output:

$ systemsettings5
[...]
org.kde.kcoreaddons: Error loading plugin "kcm_pulseaudio" "The shared library was not found." 
Plugin search paths are ("/usr/lib64/qt5/plugins", "/usr/bin") 
The environment variable QT_PLUGIN_PATH might be not correctly set
org.kde.plasma.pulseaudio: Disabling PulseAudio integration for lack of GLib event loop

The latter error is interesting as it was originally reported as an incompatibility between Phonon and Qt 5.12.  However, my understanding is that this has been patched both upstream and in Gentoo.

Could you please add the output of: emerge -pv qtmultimedia pulseaudio

# emerge -pv qtmultimedia pulseaudio

These are the packages that would be merged, in order:

Could you please attach /usr/include/qt5/QtCore/5.12.1/QtCore/private/qtcore-config_p.h?

Is this still being a problem?

I do not believe so; it appears as if one of the more recent updates to my system resolved the issue in question.  I think we can close this.

Thanks for checking back. Also more changes expected in that area with upcoming releases for pulseaudio and Plasma.
