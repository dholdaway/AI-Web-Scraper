Using Deluge 1.3.1 with pyopenssl 0.11 results with Segmentation Faults no matter what I do. Reverting to pyopenssl 0.10 fixes the problem. Recompiling Deluge with the new pyopenssl installed does not help.

I have created a thread on Deluge support forums as I don't have the rights to file a bug there: http://forum.deluge-torrent.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=34937

Reproducible: Always

As it's a segfault, any chance of a backtrace ?
Perhaps pyopenssl site is a better target than deluge.

Please post the output of emerge --info deluge pyopenssl openssl.

Had another report of downgrading pyopenssl fixing this.

Copying python herd. Any thoughts?

I can also confirm this issue. Reinstalling net-p2p/deluge-1.3.1 did not help, but downgrading from dev-python/pyopenssl-0.11 to dev-python/pyopenssl-0.10-r1 allowed deluge to start again.

Confirmed here too.

I can no longer reproduce this, however I can't find what has changed. I'm running now the combination that was failing before and it works fine.
