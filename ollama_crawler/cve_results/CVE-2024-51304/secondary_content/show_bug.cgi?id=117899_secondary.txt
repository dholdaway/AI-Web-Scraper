Description


Alan Hourihane





          2006-01-05 07:46:42 UTC
        

In the arm stage3 for uclibc 2005.0 (not armeb) the following files are badly named....

In the directory....

/usr/lib/gcc/arm-gentoo-linux-uclibc/3.4.4/include/g++-v3/arm-gentoo-linux-uclibc/bits/

there are two files called...

os_defines.
ctype_base.

these two files are missing the [h] at the end and therefore g++ programs fail to compile.

upgrade your toolchain, 3.4.6 works fine for me
