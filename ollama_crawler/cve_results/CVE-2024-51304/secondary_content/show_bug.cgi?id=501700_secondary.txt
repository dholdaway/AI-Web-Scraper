Please stabilize glibc 2.19, as it contains a couple of security related fixes.
See http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2014-02/msg00001.html

Reproducible: Always

there are already specific bugs opened for various CVE's

there's no way we've had glibc-2.19 in the tree long enough to consider stabilizing.  it's not even in ~arch yet.
