sys-devel/gdb is a blocker of bug 292402 (python-3) tracker.

sys-devel/gdb[python] depends on =sys-devel/python-2* and hard-codes some python-2 stuff. Can it be ported to Python-3?

Reproducible: Always

Bug #292402 is only for packages, which work with Python 3.1 and don't work with Python 3.2.

The dependency in the ebuild looks right to me, and there is no "python-3" tracker.

Please reopen if I missed something.
