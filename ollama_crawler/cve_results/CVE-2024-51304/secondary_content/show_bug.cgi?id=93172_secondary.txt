hello. 

I was making emerge -u world and during the process it was emerging the new
version of sox. sox-12.17.7 instead of 12.17.4-r1. Everything has been compiled 
fine but during the unmerging of the 12.17.4-r1 it stoped with mistake:

>>> 'Selected' packages are slated for removal.
>>> 'Protected' and 'omitted' packages will not be removed.

>>> Waiting 5 seconds before starting...
>>> (Control-C to abort)...
>>> Unmerging in: 5 4 3 2 1 
>>> Unmerging media-sound/sox-12.17.4-r1...
No package files given... Grabbing a set.
/var/db/pkg/media-sound/sox-12.17.4-r1/sox-12.17.4-r1.ebuild: line 27:
unexpected EOF while looking for matching `"'
/var/db/pkg/media-sound/sox-12.17.4-r1/sox-12.17.4-r1.ebuild: line 45: syntax
error: unexpected end of file

!!! ERROR: media-sound/sox-12.17.4-r1 failed.
!!! Function , Line 1686, Exitcode 1
!!! error sourcing ebuild
!!! If you need support, post the topmost build error, NOT this status message.

!!! FAILED prerm: 1

So the problem is in .ebuild file. It has one missing " sign.
It prevents new sox from beeing installed. I have corrected this really small
bug and it helps. 

It is now already only sox-12.17.4-r2 in portage and there everything is ok. So
this issue is just for information of those people who have not updated for long
time.

seems that this was either already fixed or that there was a problem with a copy
of the ebuild on a rsync mirror. cant reproduce that
