http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/vps/vserver-howto.xml

Code Listing 2.7: util-vserver init scripts

# rc-update add util-vserver default
# /etc/init.d/util-vserver start

no such script exists, only vservers.default

Please fix :-)

Not a docs-team bug.
Please do read descriptions when submitting bugs.

probably worth mentioning setattr --barrier /vservers/   too
its place in elog could be overlooked.

bene@zeus [0] ~ $ qfile -v /etc/init.d/util-vserver 
sys-cluster/util-vserver-0.30.213 (/etc/init.d/util-vserver)

actually this information is redundant, since the ebuild already does setattr for you in pkg_postinst().. the notice will probably removed in the next revision
