Description

When I emerged "xxdiff" in I got the following error, which disappeared after emerging in "flex". Therefore I think there is a dependency missing in the ebuild package.

The packages that were emerged in are called "sys-devel/flex2.5.4a-r5 and xxdiff-3.2.

i386-pc-linux-gnu-g++ -c -pipe -DXX_KDE -I/usr/kde/3.5/include -DXX_DEBUG -Wall -W -g -D_REENTRANT  -DQT_THREAD_SUPPORT -DQT_SHARED -DQT_TABLET_SUPPORT -DQT_NO_DEBUG -I/usr/qt/3/mkspecs/linux-g++ -I. -I/usr/qt/3/include -o accelUtil.o accelUtil.cpp
flex  -PresParser resParser.l
"resParser.l", line 99: unrecognized %option: bison-bridge
"resParser.l", line 100: unrecognized %option: header-file
make: *** [resParser_lex.cpp] Error 1
make: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....

!!! ERROR: dev-util/xxdiff-3.2 failed.
Call stack:
  ebuild.sh, line 1546:   Called dyn_compile
  ebuild.sh, line 937:   Called src_compile
  xxdiff-3.2.ebuild, line 43:   Called die

!!! (no error message)
!!! If you need support, post the topmost build error, and the call stack if relevant.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge xxdiff without having flex installed
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
not compiling

Expected Results:  
pulling in the required packages and compiling successfully
