Description

No problems building or using dbus, but got one QA message that said this should be reported, namely:

* QA Notice: ${WANT_AUTOMAKE} variable unset. Please report on http://bugs.gentoo.org/

There were other QA notices, but I'm just reporting this one since it said to.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge dbus (i.e., sys-apps/dbus-0.62-r2) on x86 (stable)

Actual Results:  
See message above

Expected Results:  
No QA notices.  Well, this would be expected by a utopian.

Hope this is a bug you actually WANT reported.

I got the same while emerging a dbus update.
Also, after unmerging the older version, portage says:

QA Notice: The package dbus-0.61-r1 still uses the broken debug.eclass

Might be of interest too..

we've taken the route of defaulting to latest in the eclass:
http://sources.gentoo.org/viewcvs.py/gentoo-x86/eclass/autotools.eclass?r1=1.62&r2=1.63
