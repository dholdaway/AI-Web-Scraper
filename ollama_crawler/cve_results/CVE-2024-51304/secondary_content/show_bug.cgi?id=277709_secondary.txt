Hello,

I just upgraded firefox from 3.0.10 to 3.0.11 and now I can't login to facebook. When I click the login button, nothing happens, the mouse turns into the "hourglass and pointer" pointer and the activity circle on the top right-hand corner does nothing, it stays greyed-out. I tried downgrading to 3.0.10 and it works again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Upgrade to 3.0.11
2. Go to www.facebook.com and try to login

Actual Results:  
It does nothing

Expected Results:  
It should log in

I don' t know it this should be normal or critical, since I don't know if any other sites are affected.

Have you tested with a clean profile to ensure that no files are corrupt?
