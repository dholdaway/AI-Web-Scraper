Please note that although this package is stable and automake-1.13 is ~arch,
this is still a priority fix because ~arch users are immediately affected.

Please recheck and close if i am right.

Sorry, i'm partially AWOL at the moment.

I think i reported the wrong package atom. Liblangtag-0.4.0-r1 seems OK but liblangtag-0.5.0 isn't fixed as of my sync this morning:

confiugre.ac, Line 17:
AM_CONFIG_HEADER([config.h])


..should be AC_CONFIG_HEADER.  I expect the same sed you added to 0.4.0-r1 would suffice.

Yup, but that should be no problem, because 0.5.0 is not eautoreconfed so it does not matter what macros are there, no?

It really should not fail, i installed the automake-1.13 and 0.5.0 worked like charm.

Yeah, the fatal error was turned back into a warning in the latest version of automake-1.13 .. So this is a holdout until automake-1.14 hits the tree, probably.


resolution is good tho, thanks for handling!
