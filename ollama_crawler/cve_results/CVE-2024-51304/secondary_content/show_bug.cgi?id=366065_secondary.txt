Hi,

I'm using a build farm to create tbz2 packages that I unpack on anothers
systems. I would like to build these packages by default with CFLAGS="-ggdb"
and FEATURES="splitdebug", but I also would like to have a new emerge flag
which would remove these debug files on installation :

 # emerge -k --do-not-install-/usr/lib/debug-files foo_package

This new flag could also be set into EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS.

This would allow me to build packages with debug symbols by default,
but install these symbols only when needed.

For example, today I have a segfault crash with firefox, but if I want
to run into a debug session to report a bug, I must rebuild half of the
system. This flag would allow me to reinstall packages (-k or -K) with debug
symbols easily and quickly.

Thanks.

Reproducible: Always
