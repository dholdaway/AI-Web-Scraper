Description


Martin von Gagern





          2007-05-08 15:09:50 UTC
        

I'm using enigmail and was asked by it to enter my passphrase when I decided I wanted to change that email. So I pressed cancel, but I got a new pin entry dialog. Entering a wrong password didn't help either. And as pinentry (correctly) grabs keyboard input, I could not kill it or do anything else except purely mouse-driven operations. Finally I gave up and entered my password.

However what would happen if I had forgotten my password?
Or if I let a fried write a mail on my system while I'm away?
This would be a great way to make my system unusable.
The cancel button should be honoured!

I'm not sure if this is an issue in enigmail, gnupg or pinentry.
I suspect it's enigmail, though.

Seems to be resolved in more recent versions.
