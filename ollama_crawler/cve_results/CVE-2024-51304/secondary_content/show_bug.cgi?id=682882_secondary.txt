Screenie of the issue

Hi there,

for quite some time (many years) I have been having issues with freerdp. If I connect to a server without NLA, so not having to enter credentials before the connection, I'll get a list of user accounts on recent server versions.

This is all normal, but when I click one of these accounts, it'll only state 'Connect a smart card' and no password prompt appears.

First thought it were my parameters, but even something simple like

xfreerdp /v:<someservername> -sec-nla

Does the same.

According to the #freerdp channel on freenode this isn't normal, but they have no explanation either. As stated I've been running into this for many years, haven't ever seen it work on gentoo actually. No clue why -- it's not even built with smartcard support:

If the FreeRDP people can't provide any useful guidance, I don't think I will be able to either. Sorry.
