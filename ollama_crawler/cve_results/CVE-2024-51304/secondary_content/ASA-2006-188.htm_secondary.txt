openssl security update (RHSA-2006-0661)
Original Release Date: September 12, 2006
Last Revised: September 14, 2007
Number: ASA-2006-188
Risk Level: Low
Advisory Version: 3.0
Advisory Status: Interim

1. Overview:
OpenSSL is an open source toolkit that implements the Secure Socket Layer 
(SSL) versions 2 and 3 protocols, the Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1 
protocol as well as a general use cryptography library.
An attack against the digital signatures of Public Key Cryptography Standards 
(PKCS) #1 v1.5 was recently discussed by Daniel Bleichenbacher at the 
CRYPTO-2006 conference. An attacker forging a PKCS #1 v1.5 signature on an RSA 
key with exponent 3 could possibly cause some implementations of PKCS to believe 
the key had a valid signature.  OpenSSL was verified to have this issue with 
X.509 certificates. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project 
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name 

CVE-2006-4339 to this issue.
Avaya System Products utilize an RSA key exponent of 65537.  Root access 
would be necessary to change the settings to exploit this vulnerability.
More information about this vulnerability can be found in the security 
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

Recommended Actions:For all system products which use vulnerable 
versions of openssl, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local and network 
access to the server. This restriction should be enforced through the use of 
physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other generally-accepted 
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available and can be 
installed.
3. Avaya Software-Only Products
Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems. 
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating 
system or applications that come with the operating system. These 
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly but may 
threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.
In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by 
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers 
should determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and 
then follow that vendors guidance:
