* Applying tightvnc-1.2.9-amd64.patch ...                                                                            [ ok ]
>>> Source unpacked.
>>> Compiling source in /var/tmp/portage/tightvnc-1.2.9-r1/work/vnc_unixsrc ...
/usr/portage/net-misc/tightvnc/tightvnc-1.2.9-r1.ebuild: line 41: xmkmf: command not found

I then did "emerge imake" and it fixed the problem.
