Description

I do not require ivtv package.
(I am using a pvrusb2 usb2 device which streams an mpeg2 stream as /dev/v4l/video0)


Within the mythtv-0.20 ebuild file, I'm seeing if "ivtv" USE flag is not enabled, it disables ivtv support configure flag at the beginning of the Mythtv build.

The last I checked, I do not require ivtv support *yet* (however, future versions may contain my required binary firmwares).

As of this time, my mpeg2 device works just fine & dandy w/o ivtv.  But the mythtv-0.20 will fail playing the stream becuase ivtv was disabled within the ebuild becuase the ivtv USE Flag was not set.

(Another note, the current version of ivtv ebuild w/i the current portage will only allow kernel-2.6.17.  But I have heard from one source, this same version of ivtv will build with kernel-2.6.18 -- of course, slightly hacking the ivtv ebuild.)

For all others finding this bug with your MPEG2 streaming device, either emerge ivtv (might require hacking the ebuild to force to build with =>kernel-2.6.18) or hack the mythtv-0.20_p11244.ebuild ebuild by deleting the line containing:

 use ivtv || myconf="${myconf} --disable-ivtv"

And then:

# ebuild /usr/portage/media-tv/mythtv/mythtv-0.20_p11244.ebuild digest
# emerge mythtv

Remember to do:

$ mythtv-setup (Ensure your device is using the MPEG2 driver for your capture device)
# service mythbackend restart

And then everything *should* work. :-)

(FYI, I performed the later.)

(Per the configure --help - "--disable-ivtv           disable ivtv support (PVR-x50) req. v4l support")

There's no ivtv use flag in mythtv-0.20_p11244 any more, nor the line you've mentioned above. Go emerge sync.

I sync everyday on the box I was just working on.  From the time stamps, this change appears to have took the past day (2006/09/22 15:00:26).

If I'm not mistakened, the version field "-r?" should have been bumped as well.
