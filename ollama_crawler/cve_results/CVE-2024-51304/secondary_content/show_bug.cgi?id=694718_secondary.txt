Something is causing lib2to3 to regenerate the pickle files. There is probably a weird timestamp on one of the source files.

Please tar up the /usr/lib64/python3.6/lib2to3 directory and attach it.

By recompiling python3 the issue does not happen anymore, so I guess something weird here.

(In reply to Agostino Sarubbo from comment #3)

I was hoping to inspect the files before you rebuilt python3.6, so we could know for sure what the problem was.

No problem, I made a tar before recompile.
