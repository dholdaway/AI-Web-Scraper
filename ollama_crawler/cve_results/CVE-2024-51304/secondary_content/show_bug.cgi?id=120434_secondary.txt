Details at: http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-3058918.html

emerge of pyopengl was failing because opengl-update was not working.

I was recommended to try "emerge eselect-opengl". It worked. I emerged eselect-opengl and after that pyopengl emerged fine.

Can someone please add eselect-opengl as a dependency for pyopengl.

Thanks

Ajay
