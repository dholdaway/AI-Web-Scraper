I have upgraded libexif to version 0.6.12 and recompiled libgphoto2 and gphoto2 and digikam but after all the recompilation digikam still doesn't run. If I start it from the console it says it can't find libexif.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. upgrade libexif to 0.6.12
2. reemerge libgphoto2, gphoto2, digikam
3. try to start digikam

Actual Results:  
digikam doesn't start and it can not find libexif

Expected Results:  
digikam should be able to find libexif and start as it does with the older
version of libexif.

Digikam depends on libkexif which depends on libexif. `revdep-rebuild -X -soname libexif.so.9 -p` should help. You can find out what library you have to check for by calling `equery f libexif | grep \.so`. OR just run `revdep-rebuild -p`, the list of ebuilds to recompile might be longer.

I did run revdep-rebuild -p but it did not list and rebuild libkexif. It did find others like libgphoto and did rebuild them but no libkexif.

Did you try to re-emerge libkipi and kipi-plugins ? Also some "sane"-stuff seems
to depend on libexif, you might want to re-emerge those too. And also "wine"

I had to manualy reemerge libkipi and other ebuilds. Shouldn't revdep-rebuild
find all ebuilds that need to be rebuilt after the libraries change?

Jure: On the one hand revdep-rebuild is buggy, on the other it relies on the
convention, that upstream developers raise the major version of their library,
if they change the interface. In the end, this hack won't work always.
