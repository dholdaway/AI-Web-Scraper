I've got Mate-Pluma Editor 1.8.1 and if I type underscore, the underscore is not shown it's blank spaces. Same behavoir with Gedit 3.14.3. Can't say if this is a real Bug, but I wanted to report this to you guys...

Thank you for reporting. 

I can not reproduce this bug here. 
If it appears in other editors too, it is a sign that the problem is somewhere else.

Is the underscore visible  if you increase the size of the affected font ?
(beside that IMO this is rather a forum topic as long as you cant provide a handy error message)

yes. on font size 11 I got that problem. beginning with 12 its shown... so when i set 10 e.g its also shown. so there is a problem with that special size 11...

so now, it became a real bug i guess. i wanted to change the font and then the window crashed. now when i open it up -> go to settings -> click on the tab "fonts and colors" it crashes every time i try it. Even then when i restarted the system. 

Where are the logfiles?

(I might just go back to vim...scnr...) ;-)

I can't confirm this at all.  I followed your steps to reproduce this, and it works fine over here.   run pluma from the command line, and see if it outputs anything, and attach your emerge --info please.  Sounds like something else is liable to be the issue.

What font are you using, and can you confirm if you get this using another font? (For example, I am using monospace without issue)

Unfortunately I can't really say which font is active right now because every time when I click on that tab it crashes... is there a way to change font without gui?

Either use gsettings to probe the values via cli, or browse via GUI dconf-editor.  Additionally, you there are two states, using the theme's font, and using a custom selected font.  You can change the theme's font in the DE's appearance window.  Knowing both the theme default, and know what pluma is currently set to would be useful.  And try resetting the value if custom, via dconf-editor, and report back with all you can.

The several other bug reports for a variety of applications regarding the error message you got all indicated it was an issue with a particular font (in each case). Some alleged it was bitmap fonts, but regardless, it appears to be an issue with cairo and certain fonts.  I'm going to close as CANTFIX.  Feel free to file an upstream bug and/or have this reopened as an issue of cairo and new century schoolbook compatibility issues if you feel it necessary.

Oh, it is still busted? I thought you said in comment #13 that it was working with monospace?  So, with pluma run from terminal, and set to monospace, 11pt, typing a _ is not visible?   Same terminal output as before when you do that?

I actually found 2 different Bugs.

1) monospace 11 -> underscores are broken (no errror report)
2) New Century Schoolbook 11 -> window crashes with error report
