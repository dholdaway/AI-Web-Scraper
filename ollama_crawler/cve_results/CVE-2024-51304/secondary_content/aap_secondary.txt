(NYSE: AAP), a leading automotive aftermarket parts provider in North America, that serves both professional installer and do-it-yourself customers, announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2022. "In 2022, our team members once again worked to serve our customers with relentless focus and dedication. Despite challenges throughout 2022, we made progress on our strategic initiatives, including the expansion of our footprint, further strengthening of our DieHard® brand and improved customer loyalty,” said Tom Greco, president and chief executive officer. “However, we are not satisfied with our results in 2022 and are taking decisive actions to improve performance in 2023. Importantly, the disciplined inventory and pricing actions we discussed last quarter to adapt to an evolving competitive landscape contributed to stronger results in Q4 and we ended the year with positive momentum. “We expect to see further improvements in inventory availability throughout 2023, which we view as the single most important driver to accelerate topline growth. After several years of significant investments in complex transformation initiatives and the majority of the integration behind us, we’re now able to focus more time and resources on leveraging our differentiated asset base and improving execution to drive long-term shareholder value.”   Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Results (1, 2)Fourth quarter 2022 Net sales totaled $2.5 billion, a 3.2% increase compared with the prior year, primarily driven by strategic pricing and new store openings. Comparable store sales for the fourth quarter 2022 increased 2.1%. For full year 2022, Net sales of $11.2 billion increased 1.4% from 2021. Comparable store sales for the full year increased 0.3%.(1) All comparisons are based on the same time period in the prior year. Comparable store sales include locations open for 13 complete accounting periods and excludes sales to independently owned Carquest locations.(2) For a better understanding of the company's adjusted results, refer to the reconciliation of non-GAAP adjustments in the accompanying financial tables included herein.The following information was filed by Advance Auto Parts Inc (AAP) on Tuesday, February 28, 2023 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.

 Inside Advance Auto Parts Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
Non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted net income and Adjusted EPS, should not be used as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, or considered in isolation, for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance, financial position or cash flows.



 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
When adjusted for the following non-operational items, our Adjusted diluted earnings per share ("Adjusted EPS") in 2022 was $13.04 compared with $12.02 in 2021: Refer to "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for a definition and reconciliation of Adjusted EPS and other non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
This decrease was primarily due to inflationary product costs, including the impact of LIFO related expenses, and unfavorable channel mix, primarily offset by improvements in strategic pricing and product mix.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
We have identified several initiatives as part of our business strategy to increase sales, expand margins, drive accelerated growth and deliver top quartile results relative total shareholder return.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
