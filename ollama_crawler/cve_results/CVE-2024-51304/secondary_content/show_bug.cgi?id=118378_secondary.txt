There is one thing most people will want to do with their gentoo system - perform just a plain system upgrade. But when they go to the page dedicated to upgrade guides - http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/index.xml?catid=upgrade - they won't be able to find it.

I don't want to upgrade from Gentoo 1.4. I don't want to know how new Gentoo releases affect existing installs. I don't want to migrate kernel. I don't
want to upgrade just Apache. I don't want to upgrade just MySQL. I don't want
to upgrade just GCC. I don't want to upgrade Gnome. I don't want to migrate
to Modular X. I want just plain, ordinary, gentoo system upgrade!

I suggest this to be added into the list - on the top position. Because that's
what most of the users need.

So run 'emerge -uD world' and be done with it. Sorry, don't see why this needs a guide. The guides are provided for cases when upgrading in non-trivial.
