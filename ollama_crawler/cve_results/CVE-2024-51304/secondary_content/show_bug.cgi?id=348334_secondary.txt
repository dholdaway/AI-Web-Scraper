http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-amd64.xml?part=1&chap=6 says
"The default USE settings are placed in the make.defaults files of your profile. You will find make.defaults files in the directory which /etc/make.profile points to and all parent directories as well."

This worked in 2008.0 but in 10.0 there is no make.defaults file in this directory. In fact I can't seem to find any USE flags in my profile (10.0/desktop)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Follow the guide
2. On the section "Configuring the USE variable" try to find your profile's USE flags
3. Faile

You're doing it wrong. As explained in the handbook and in the Portage documentation, /etc/make.profile is a symlink that points to your profile. In my case:

make.profile -> ../usr/portage/profiles/default/linux/amd64/10.0

It says "files" plural -- you have to look inside the "parent" files to see what they point to, as well as what the parent directories point to. It's all there.
