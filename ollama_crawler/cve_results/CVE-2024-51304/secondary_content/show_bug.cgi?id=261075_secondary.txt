Description

/etc/init.d/alsasound stop hangs when trying to remove modules on a 2.6.29-rc6 kernel, whereas it works fine on 2.6.28. I have a Intel HDA card (MacBook Pro 2,1). While in 2.6.28 there was only one ALSA module loaded (snd_hda_intel), in 2.6.29 there are now three modules. The module unloading logic tries to unload them in the wrong order with rmmod. Instead a simple modprobe -r snd_hda_intel would do fine.

This causes a hang during shutdown, which is very annoying.

Reproducible: Always

Thats why module unloading is considered a bad idea (is written and handled in 
~ version of alsa-utils) and should not be used.

So the workaround is:
/etc/conf.d/alsasound:
UNLOAD_ON_STOP="no"
