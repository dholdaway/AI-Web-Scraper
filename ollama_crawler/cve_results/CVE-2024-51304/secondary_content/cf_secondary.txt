NYSE: CFSafe harbor statement
All statements in this presentation by CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”), other than those relating to historical facts, are
forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can generally be identified by their use of terms such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,”
 “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “predict,” “project,” “will” or “would” and similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions. Forward-looking
statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the
Company’s control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements may include, but are not limited to, statements
about the synergies and other benefits, and other aspects of the transactions with Incitec Pivot Limited (“IPL”), strategic plans and management’s expectations
with respect to the production of green and blue (low-carbon) ammonia, the development of carbon capture and sequestration projects, the transition to and
growth of a hydrogen economy, greenhouse gas reduction targets, projected capital expenditures, statements about future financial and operating results, and
other items described in this presentation. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements
include, among others, the risk of obstacles to realization of the benefits of the transactions with IPL; the risk that the synergies from the transactions with IPL may
not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; the risk that the completion of the transactions with IPL, including integration of the Waggaman
ammonia production complex into the Company’s operations, disrupt current operations or harm relationships with customers, employees and suppliers; the risk
that integration of the Waggaman ammonia production complex with the Company’s current operations will be more costly or difficult than expected or may
otherwise be unsuccessful; diversion of management time and attention to issues relating to the transactions with IPL; unanticipated costs or liabilities associated
with the IPL transactions; the cyclical nature of the Company’s business and the impact of global supply and demand on the Company’s selling prices; the global
commodity nature of the Company’s nitrogen products, the conditions in the international market for nitrogen products, and the intense global competition from
other producers; conditions in the United States, Europe and other agricultural areas, including the influence of governmental policies and technological
developments on the demand for our fertilizer products; the volatility of natural gas prices in North America and the United Kingdom; weather conditions and the
impact of adverse weather events; the seasonality of the fertilizer business; the impact of changing market conditions on the Company’s forward sales programs;
difficulties in securing the supply and delivery of raw materials, increases in their costs or delays or interruptions in their delivery; reliance on third party providers
of transportation services and equipment; the Company’s reliance on a limited number of key facilities; risks associated with cybersecurity; acts of terrorism and
regulations to combat terrorism; risks associated with international operations; the significant risks and hazards involved in producing and handling the Company’s
products against which the Company may not be fully insured; the Company’s ability to manage its indebtedness and any additional indebtedness that may be
incurred; the Company’s ability to maintain compliance with covenants under its revolving credit agreement and the agreements governing its indebtedness;
downgrades of the Company’s credit ratings; risks associated with changes in tax laws and disagreements with taxing authorities; risks involving derivatives and
the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management and hedging activities; potential liabilities and expenditures related to environmental, health and safety laws
and regulations and permitting requirements; regulatory restrictions and requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions; the development and growth of the
market for green and blue (low-carbon) ammonia and the risks and uncertainties relating to the development and implementation of the Company’s green and blue
(low-carbon) ammonia projects; risks associated with expansions of the Company’s business, including unanticipated adverse consequences and the significant
resources that could be required; and risks associated with the operation or management of the strategic venture with CHS (the “CHS Strategic Venture”), risks
and uncertainties relating to the market prices of the fertilizer products that are the subject of the supply agreement with CHS over the life of the supply agreement,
and the risk that any challenges related to the CHS Strategic Venture will harm the Company’s other business relationships. More detailed information about
factors that may affect the Company’s performance and could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements may be found
in CF Industries Holdings, Inc.’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including CF Industries Holdings, Inc.’s most recent annual and quarterly
reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, which are available in the Investor Relations section of the Company’s web site. It is not possible to predict or identify all
risks and uncertainties that might affect the accuracy of our forward-looking statements and, consequently, our descriptions of such risks and uncertainties should
not be considered exhaustive. There is no guarantee that any of the events, plans or goals anticipated by these forward-looking statements will occur, and if any of
the events do occur, there is no guarantee what effect they will have on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and future prospects.
Forward-looking statements are given only as of the date of this presentation and the Company disclaims any obligation to update or revise the forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.Note regarding non-GAAP financial measures
The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Management
believes that EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, free cash flow to adjusted EBITDA conversion and free cash flow yield,
which are non-GAAP financial measures, provide additional meaningful information regarding the Company's performance and
financial strength. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's
reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, EBITDA,
adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, free cash flow to adjusted EBITDA conversion and free cash flow yield included in this presentation
may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow,
and free cash flow yield to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the tables accompanying this presentation.
EBITDA is defined as net earnings attributable to common stockholders plus interest expense - net, income taxes, and depreciation
and amortization. Other adjustments include the elimination of loan fee amortization that is included in both interest and amortization,
and the portion of depreciation that is included in noncontrolling interest. The Company has presented EBITDA because
management uses the measure to track performance and believes that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and
other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the industry.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted with the selected items as summarized in the tables accompanying this
presentation. The Company has presented adjusted EBITDA because management uses adjusted EBITDA, and believes it is useful
to investors, as a supplemental financial measure in the comparison of year-over-year performance.
Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, as stated in the consolidated statements of cash flows,
reduced by capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interests. Free cash flow to adjusted EBITDA conversion is
defined as free cash flow divided by adjusted EBITDA. Free cash flow yield is defined as free cash flow divided by market value of
equity (market cap). For full year 2022, the Company has also presented cash provided by operating activities, free cash flow, free
cash flow to adjusted EBITDA conversion and free cash flow yield, in each case excluding certain tax and interest payments made to
Canadian tax authorities in relation to an arbitration decision covering tax years 2006 through 2011 and to our transfer pricing
positions between Canada and the United States for open years 2012 and after. The Company has presented these financial
measures, as well as the financial measures free cash flow, free cash flow to adjusted EBITDA conversion and free cash flow yield,
because management uses these measures and believes they are useful to investors, as an indication of the strength of the
Company and its ability to generate cash and to evaluate the Company’s cash generation ability relative to its industry competitors. It
should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures.4

CF Industries Adjusted EBITDA sensitivity table
Table illustrates the CF Industries business model across a broad range of
industry conditions
$50/ton urea realized movement implies ~$725M change in Adjusted EBITDA on an annual basis
(1) Based on 2023 sales volumes of approximately 19.1 million product tons, 2023 gas consumption of 341 million MMBtus and 2023 nitrogen product sales price
relationships. Changes in product prices and gas costs are not applied to the CHS minority interest or industrial contracts where CF Industries is naturally hedged against
changes in product prices and gas costs
(2) Assumes that a $50 per ton change in urea prices is also applied proportionally to all nitrogen products and is equivalent to a $34.78 per ton change in UAN price, $36.96
per ton change in AN price, $89.14 per ton change in ammonia price, and $21.20 per ton change in the price of the Other segment
