In text console:

Ensure $PWD is printed in shell prompt and coloring is on.

1. mkdir -p long_name1/long_name2/...
2. cd long_name1/long_name2/...

If all shell prompt is bigger than 80 chars, cursor becomes dark blue (in my case)

3. cd ..

Cursor is normal again.

Console screenshot

New observation: shell prompt should be long enough _and_ scrolling down should
be made. Just long shell prompt (right after login) give proper color.

try bash-3.1_p5-r1 and if it still breaks, take a screenshot from inside of linux rather than using a camera
