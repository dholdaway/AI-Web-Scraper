remove buildpkg from FEATURES and see if you can emerge p7zip

if you can, try re-emerging bzip2 and tar with CFLAGS='-pipe'

i highly doubt this has anything to do with portage

my guess is your combo of using -march with -Os made your box unstable

Bleh, bug wranglers won't really solve this. Please, mark WORKSFORME/INVALID or
debug this with the reporter.
