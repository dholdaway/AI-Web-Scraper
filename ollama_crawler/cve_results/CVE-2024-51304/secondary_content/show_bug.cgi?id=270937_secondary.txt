It appears that the new openrc scripts perform some fancy "caching" operation.  Unfortunately on my system this can take 15-20 seconds.  In an era when most linux distributors are trying to make Linux boot faster, Gentoo seems to be heading in the other direction.  Ubuntu boots *significantly* faster on my machine compared with Gentoo, presumably in part due to this "Caching" operation.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Boot most recent version of linux with most recent baselayout-2 & /etc/init.d files.

Actual Results:  
System boots slowly and exhibits lengthy delays involving "Caching service dependencies".

Expected Results:  
System should boot at least as fast as it used to before the init & init.d upgrades were released.  Preferably Gentoo should boot at least as fast as Ubuntu.

My system also seems to be in a "confused" state in that in some cases (lvm and device-mapper) it seems to think it is in baselayout-1 rather than baselayout-2 (which is what is installed).

Is there a way to fix this? (How does it determine the baselayout state?)

please emerge app-benchmarks/bootchart and reboot with "init=/sbin/bootchartd" in kernel command line. Then attach /var/log/bootchart.tgz.

Robert, your baselayout-1/baselayout-2 confusion is probably due to bug 270646, please CC yourself on that for any further information.

As to the caching issue, it shouldn't attempt a recache on every boot (as far as I'm aware), perhaps there are issues with your clock settings making it assuming the cache is out of date at every boot?

make sure you're using the latest openrc and during shutdown, it should save the cache state to disk.  so make sure you do a clean reboot.  you might also want to try running `rc-status` manually to force a sync.
