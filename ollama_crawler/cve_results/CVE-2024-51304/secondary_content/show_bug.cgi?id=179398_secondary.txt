Description

Portage has MySQL 5.0.40 unmasked and available for building, but there was a bug marked serious by the MySQL team in that version (http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=27590).  I would suggest masking that version until 5.0.42 is available.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge mysql
2. use any app that compares DATE and DATETIME fields
3. watch it work incorrectly

We are not going to mask this; it fixes a DoS vulnerability. Have you tested the upstream patch?

Sorry if I'm a little slow on this, but will the upstream patch from MySQL be applied automatically when I emerge, or is it something I need to do by hand?  As of last night 5.0.40 was still having the same issue (I upgraded last night), but the bug was fixed by the MySQL team on May 2nd.

Please combine the following two patches and test to see the problem is resolved for you.

You need to apply the patches manually (or modify the ebuild to apply them for you).

5.0.42 will be in the tree now and should contain these fixes.

Note that 5.0.42 also has issues regarding date comparisons, see:

Bruno, please retest with 5.0.44 that is entering the tree shortly.

no response from user, I assume 5.0.44 fixed it, 5.0.54 is in the tree too now.
