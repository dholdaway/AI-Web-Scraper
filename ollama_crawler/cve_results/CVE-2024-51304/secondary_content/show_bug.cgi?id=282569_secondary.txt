Description

After updating my system with emerge --sync; emerge -u world, the JPEG library was updated to version 7.0, and oowriter failed to start because it was looking for libjpeg.so.62:

$ oowriter ~/Service/JJAS/intrinsic-motivation-final.docx/usr/lib64/openoffice/program/soffice.bin:
error while loading shared libraries: libjpeg.so.62:
cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

running revdep-rebuild --library=libjpeg.so.62 didn't help.  All other apps and libraries (except KDE 3.5) were rebuild successfully (ie, revdep-rebuild --pretend doesn't find them).

Rebuild openoffice (either "emerge --oneshot openoffice" or try just "revdep-rebuild -v -- -a". If that does not fix it, reopen this bug.

OK, so rebuilding OpenOffice *yet again* (with 'emerge --oneshot openoffice') works.  Is it known why OpenOffice needs to be built twice to succeed?  (Yes, it was definitely built the first time I ran revdep-rebuild.)

It may be possible with the preserved-libs feature of portage-2.2_rcX that openoffice linked against the preserved old lib, which was not possible after the second run since it was removed.
