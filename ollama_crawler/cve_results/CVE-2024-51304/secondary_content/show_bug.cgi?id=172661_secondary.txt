I'm mainly using Gnome, but I recently installed Filelight. Since then, when I go to "Places" ("Orte" in German) in Gnome and select a folder, or when I click on the download folder in Extras -> Downloads in Firefox, Filelight opens. It used to be so, that Nautilus opens.

I did a "sudo grep -ri filelight /home /etc" and found nothing.

I just now discovered, that, for some reason, folders were set to open with Filelight. I right clicked on a folder, selected "Properties" and went to "Open with" ("Öffnen mit"). There, Filelight was selected.

This should not have been the case.

Properties of a folder, "Öffnen mit" tab

That's the "Open with" (Öffnen mit) tab of the properites dialog of a folder. As can be seen, Filelight is selected.

The desktop entry is fine. Why Nautilus chooses it (or is configured to?) to open directories is not a KDE problem.

Gnome can use any number of file managers to open folders.  I'm not sure how it selects with one to use by default, but I think it's some kind of alphabetical search; regardless, select "Open Folder" (sorry, I don't know what that is in German) in that Open With tab, and it will go back to using nautilus, and never change again unless you select it.  Upstream is aware of this issue, and will presumably fix default file manager selection to be nautilus in future versions.
