Description

In order to run 'aticonfig' after emerging the 'ati-drivers [8.27.10-r1]' package, I had to add  /opt/ati/bin/ to my PATH variable in order to be able to run 'aticonfig'.

I think this is a good to know feature for the newly gentooists.

[however this "bug" could also be a consequence of my own ignorance, please advice]

x11-drivers/ati-drivers installs its own /etc/env.d/09ati entry... Run `env-update && source /etc/profile` or logout and login again...

<snip>
PATH=/opt/ati/bin
ROOTPATH=/opt/ati/bin:/opt/ati/sbin
MANPATH=/opt/ati/man
</snip>
