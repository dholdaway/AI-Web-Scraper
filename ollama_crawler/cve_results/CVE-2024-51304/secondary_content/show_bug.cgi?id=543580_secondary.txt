Having a pretend mode would help in some cases like remotely checking which services on servers need to be restarted.

Hi Justin,

thanks for your feedback!

Isn't "-l" what you are looking for? It lists all services to be restarted and how they are classified.

Additionally you can user interactive mode, so you wil be asked before every action.

What are you missing here?

Feedback mucch appreciated ;)
