Exhibit 99.1Media ContactInvestor ContactAudria BeltonJennifer H. Demba, CFAMedia RelationsInvestor Relationsmedia@synovus.cominvestorrelations@synovus.comSynovus announces earnings for the fourth quarter 2023Diluted earnings per share of $0.41 vs. $1.35 in 4Q22Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.80 vs. $1.35 in 4Q22$51 million FDIC Special Assessment Reduced 4Q23 Reported and Adjusted EPS by $0.26COLUMBUS, Ga., Jan. 17, 2024 - Synovus Financial Corp. (NYSE: SNV) today reported financial results for the quarter and year ended Dec. 31, 2023.  “Synovus' 2023 financial performance is a testament to our resilience and the strength of our business model,” said Synovus Chairman, CEO and President Kevin Blair. “Amid a challenging economic landscape in 2023, we broadened client relationships, further diversified our business mix, streamlined expenses and took strategic actions to optimize the balance sheet. Our strong banking footprint and ongoing investments in talent, capabilities, functionalities and new revenue sources fuel the bank’s path to solid growth. We persist in bolstering our core deposit generation, enriching lending diversification, enhancing expense efficiency and delivering world-class client service. As we execute our plan, we're confident momentum will build throughout 2024 and beyond for Synovus.”2023 Highlights•Net income available to common shareholders for 2023 was $507.8 million, or $3.46 per diluted share, compared to $724.7 million, or $4.95 per diluted share in 2022. Adjusted EPS for 2023 was $4.12 per diluted share compared to $4.93 per diluted share in 2022.•The $51 million FDIC special assessment incurred during the fourth quarter 2023 reduced reported and adjusted EPS by $0.26. •Pre-provision net revenue was $885.2 million in 2023 compared to $1.05 billion in 2022. •Net interest income was $1.82 billion in 2023, up from $1.80 billion in the prior year, largely attributable to average loan growth and higher earning asset yields, which combined to more than offset rising funding costs.  •During 2023, Synovus sold $422 million in third party consumer loans and $1.2 billion in medical office building loans with the proceeds used to pay down wholesale borrowings.•Period-end loans declined $311.9 million, or 1%, in 2023 as commercial and industrial growth was more than offset by declines in commercial real estate and consumer loans. •Period-end deposits increased $1.87 billion, or 4%, primarily driven by growth in time deposits and interest-bearing demand deposits, partially offset by a decline in non-interest-bearing deposits. Brokered deposits increased $744.0 million, or 14%, in 2023. •During the fourth quarter 2023, Synovus repositioned its securities portfolio by selling $1.3 billion of bonds, which resulted in securities losses of $78 million. The proceeds have been reinvested in other high-quality liquid assets with better yields, which should augment 2024 net interest income by an estimated $28 million.The following information was filed by Synovus Financial Corp (SNV) on Wednesday, January 17, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.
