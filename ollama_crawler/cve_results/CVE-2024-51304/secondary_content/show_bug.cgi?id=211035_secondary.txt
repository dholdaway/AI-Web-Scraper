Description


Denis de La Fortelle





          2008-02-21 21:03:33 UTC
        

After updating to 1.4.0 from 20070526.
When starting gschem, the Messages box show that the mandatory /usr/share/gEDA/system-gafrc file is not installed.
It is located in the libgeda package.

It should be installed if not already present, and if present the user should be warned to proceed to a merge. That is a procedure like for /etc files.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. (re)move the /usr/share/gEDA/system-gafrc file
2.~$ gschem
3.look at the beginning of the message box.

Actual Results:  
When starting gschem, the Messages box show that the mandatory /usr/share/gEDA/system-gafrc file is not installed.

Expected Results:  
Message box does not list the mandatory /usr/share/gEDA/system-gafrc file as missing.

Thanks anyway.

Sorry, I can't reproduce this here. The system-gafrc file is normally installed. Please unmerge and remerge and check it works as expected.

If it already exists it is a file collision and should be fixed. Please file a bug whenever you see this.

> and if present the user should

Please open a bug any time you want to submit a patch for an enhancement you'd like. Unless it's completely unreasonable, I'll be happy to commit it.

Denis.
