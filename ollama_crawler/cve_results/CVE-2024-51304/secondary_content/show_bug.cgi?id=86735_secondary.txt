Description

In KDE 3.3 kfontview, when called from kcontrol, will preview postscript fonts, but shows a blank when faced with a truetype font.  Furthermore, Konqueror and the Desktop won't preview any fonts at all, neither truetype nor postscript.  In konqueror the font files only show generic font icons (even though I get previews of all the other file types I told Kcontrol I wanted previews of), while on the Desktop font files show up as empty white squares. If I click on these icons I will get an empty font preview (empty, that is, except for the text at the top - e.g. "Shatter[Altsys], 28pt/21pt").

I have freetype 1 and 2 installed.  I can't think what else I need to check for at the moment.

I can view the fonts in gfontview, although they show up as horribly aliased.  I don't know if they are meant to be.

Coming to think of it, in OpenOffice fonts look about as OK as they usually do there, but look more aliased than I would have expected (from my experience on a previous Linux installation) in Kword.  I don't know if this is part of the same KDE font problem.





Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.open kfontview from kcontrol and browse postscript and truetype fonts.
2.drop font files on the desktop and look at the icons.  Look at the icons using konqueror.
3.click on truetype and postscript font icons.

Actual Results:  
1. You see previews of postscript, but not truetype fonts.
2. You see either white squares or generic TT or PS font icons, but you don't 
see font thumbnails.
3. You see a preview of the emperor's new zen font.

I could not reproduce this problem here, but it seems definitely related to fontconfig/freetype. I can only suggest to see if you can reproduce the bug in kde 3.4...
