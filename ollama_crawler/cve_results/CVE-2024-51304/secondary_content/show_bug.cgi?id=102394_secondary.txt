The read bit needs to be set properly so users can download the files.

I mean the files on that mirror are set not readable by apache or ftp, meaning 
although they are listed on the mirror, they are not downlable, making the chem 
mirror useless to download the sparc 2005.1 liveCD's from.

Trying to download results in a 404.

Oh OK, now it's much more clear. Thanks!

looks fine to me, mirror might have just missed the first bit-flip sync, and
picked it up on the next one.
