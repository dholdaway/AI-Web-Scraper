Description


Toralf Förster

With Xchat I get a " #gentoo :http://www.gentoo.org", "#gentoo-dev :http://www.gentoo.org" and " #gentoo-kde :http://kde.gentoo.org" message immediately after I join the appropriate channel.
However there should be space after the first colon to start a browser with the given link. Without that a message like

Unable to run the command specified. The file or folder file:///home/tfoerste/:http:/kde.gentoo.org does not exist.

occurs.


Reproducible: Always

A "bug" in xchat. With irssi:

10:57 -!- Home page for #gentoo-dev: http://www.gentoo.org

That colon is there because of the IRC protocol.
The proper solution would be to write a plugin that handles 328 numerical replies.

That should be pretty trivial. This is a raw log exceprt:
>> :verne.freenode.net 328 f0000_ #gentoo :http://www.gentoo.org

So, I'll close this as worksforme. *shrug*
