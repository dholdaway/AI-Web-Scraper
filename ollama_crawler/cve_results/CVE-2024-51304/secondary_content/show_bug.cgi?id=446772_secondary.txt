What version of dev-libs/glib do you have installed?

Here is the output from emerge --info dev-libs/glib
=================================================================
                        Package Settings
=================================================================

dev-libs/glib-2.32.4-r1 was built with the following:
USE="-debug (-fam) (-selinux) -static-libs -systemtap -test -utils -xattr"

This looks like if you had local includes of older glib, possibly in /usr/local/include/

As in, somehow you have 2 conflicting versions of glib installed on the same system

You know that you can't just install autotoolized projects with ./configure; make; make install without destroying the system as /usr/local is picked up and will conflict with packages installed from Portage?

as gnome@ is the maintainer for glib, moving out from freedesktop-bugs@, this definately isn't a pkg-config bug if the installation of glib is messed up
