Would it be possible for the ebuild to include the dovecot-auth for postfix to avoid ahving to use sasl on systems that are postfix/dovecot-servers?

I'm looking forward to this too - but as this is available out of the box for postfix 2.3 do you think bug #138192 would fix this? I see there's already an ebuild there.

Seems OK with rc1 :)
