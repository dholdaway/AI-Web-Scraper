 Inside Q2 Holdings, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Expense   Highlight
The actions taken by such institutions to address potential liquidity concerns have resulted in certain institutions incurring substantial costs that have negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, their profitability and could lead to further market instability or bank failures.

 Other - Other   Highlight
If actual results, or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets, we could incur impairment charges in a future period.
