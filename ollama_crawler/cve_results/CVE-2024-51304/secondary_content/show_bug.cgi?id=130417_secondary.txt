I am trying to build a new Gentoo system with Xorg 7. I have experienced the same error as described in the first posting of http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-441825-start-0-postdays-0-postorder-asc-highlight-openmotif.html,  with gcc 3.4.5, but the solution given seems to be for another problem connected to the print-system of openmotif. emerge -Dav --oneshot printproto xbitmaps libXp doesn't help for me.

Please, do not refer to external links with bug description, that makes searching for duplicates completely useless... emerge --info missing as well.

Don't downgrade gcc next time...
