I've tryed to write a Initscript with this documentation. 
It would be helpful if there would be added that you have to add options after two -- when you use start-stop-daemon. 
like this: start-stop-daemon --start --exec /usr/bin/rsync --pidfile /var/run/rsyncd.pid -- --daemon ${RSYNC_OPTS} 
instead of start-stop-daemon --start --exec '/usr/bin/rsync --daemon ${RSYNC_OPTS}' --pidfile /var/run/rsyncd.pid. 
The most users will know it but mybe not everyone. Especially these ones who need this documentation can have problems like me. 
It's also missing in the German documentation.

Reproducible: Always

There's nothing in any of our guides about a call to "/usr/bin/rsync --daemon" much less the "incorrect" version you posted with ${RSYNC_OPTS}. Can you please specify where exactly in the guide you see this problem, and restate what you think it should be? I realize English is not your first language, so you may want to talk to one of our German translators who can interpret for me. Thanks!

He's suggesting that the guide could be improved by specifying that additional options for the daemon to be launched should be separated by "--", otherwise they'd get interpreted by s-s-d.

Since we don't talk about s-s-d and a specific program, we don't need to cover additional options in the handbook. We'd be duplicating content at the very beginning of the s-s-d manpage:

"Any arguments given after -- on the command line are passed unmodified to the program being started."

Works as-is for me . . .
