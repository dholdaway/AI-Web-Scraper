 Inside Pricesmart Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
For the three and twelve-months ended August 31, 2023, net income attributable to PriceSmart was negatively impacted by $9.2 million in total and diluted earnings per share was negatively impacted by $0.30.



 Financial - Expense   Highlight
We recorded a $15.3 million net loss in total other expense, net in fiscal year 2023 compared to a $10.6 million net loss in total other expense, net in the same period last year primarily due to an increase of $10.9 million of other expense, which is primarily foreign currency transaction losses, partially offset by an increase of $7.7 million in interest income comparatively.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
In addition to relevant GAAP measures, we also provide non-GAAP measures including adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA and net merchandise sales - constant currency because management believes these metrics are useful to investors and analysts by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance.

 Other - Other   Highlight
The increase in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily the result of a net positive change in working capital generated from changes in our merchandise inventory and accounts payable positions, which contributed $84.9 million, and net a positive change in our other various operating assets and liabilities.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
We believe adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are useful metrics to investors and analysts because they present more accurate year-over-year comparisons for our net income and net income per diluted share because adjusted items are not the result of our normal operations.
