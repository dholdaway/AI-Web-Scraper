 Inside Otis Worldwide Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
The qualitative assessment requires judgments by management about economic conditions including the entity’s operating environment, its industry and other market considerations, entity-specific events related to financial performance or loss of key personnel and other events that could impact the reporting unit.



 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Increased regulation (including pending SEC and European Union requirements) and other climate change concerns, however, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, and we are not able to predict how such regulations or concerns would affect our business, operations or financial results.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, rate of increase in employee compensation levels and mortality rates.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have decreased or increased 2023 pension expense by approximately $2 million.

 Legal - Other   Highlight
Where it is not practically feasible to determine the legally enforceable portion of our obligation under certain of our long-term purchase agreements, we include additional expected purchase obligations beyond what may be legally enforceable.
