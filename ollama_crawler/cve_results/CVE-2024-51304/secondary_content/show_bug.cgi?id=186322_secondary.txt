emerge -uND world after a sync on 23/7/2007 9:00 GMT returned this error:

Calculating world dependencies /!!! Digest verification failed:
!!! /var/portage/www-client/mozilla-firefox/mozilla-firefox-2.0.0.4.ebuild
!!! Reason: Filesize does not match recorded size
!!! Got: 9114
!!! Expected: 9250

I can't see if it's a faulty download from my end or which is the correct size. But the ebuild appears complete: It's md5sum:

nazgul mozilla-firefox # md5sum mozilla-firefox-2.0.0.4.ebuild
51d2e40a39bef8e6303ceba9f0cdc449  mozilla-firefox-2.0.0.4.ebuild


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge --sync
2. emerge -avuND world
3.

Actual Results:  
digest verification failure

Expected Results:  
digest and actual file should match

emerge --info n/a/ here surely?
