It correctly depends on virtual/linux. The zen-sources ebuild looks fine to me...

>>> Messages generated by process 28139 on 2010-04-14 13:43:28 NOVST for package x11-libs/libdrm-2.4.20:

WARN: postinst
libdrm's ABI may have changed without change in library name
Please rebuild media-libs/mesa, x11-base/xorg-server and
your video drivers in x11-drivers/*.

After this i run:
 % sudo emerge -avq nvidia-drivers
Password: 
[ebuild  N    ] sys-kernel/gentoo-sources-2.6.33-r1  USE="-build -symlink" 
[ebuild   R   ] x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers-195.36.15  USE="acpi (multilib)
-custom-cflags -gtk"

Would you like to merge these packages? [Yes/No] 

 % eselect kernel list
Available kernel symlink targets:
  [1]   linux-2.6.29-hardened
  [2]   linux-2.6.32-zen6 *

Later i install sys-kernel/gentoo-sources-2.6.33-r1 with x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers-195.36.15 and remove sys-kernel/gentoo-sources-2.6.33-r1
 % sudo emerge -avq nvidia-drivers
Password: 
[ebuild   R   ] x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers-195.36.15  USE="acpi (multilib) -custom-cflags -gtk" 

Would you like to merge these packages? [Yes/No] 

With "emerge -uDNavt world" before and after installing gentoo-sources i have no problem, because nvidia-driver is already installed.
P.S. Sorry for my pure english.

This bug is definitely not a valid one. One way to verify it works is to remove zen-sources, gentoo-sources, nvidia-drivers

Then install zen-sources and after that try to install nvidia-drivers again

Reopen if needed
