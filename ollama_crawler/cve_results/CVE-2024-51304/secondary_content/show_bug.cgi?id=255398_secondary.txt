In the URL you can see the information of the CTAN package for office use. It includes useful macros for writing presentation slides, CV's, spreadsheets, memos, etc.

I couldn't find it in Portage, so I'm asking for it to be included.

there is no "office" meta-package in texlive afaik.
however, lots (if not all, i didnt check all) of these packages in url are already packaged; you can use texmfind to find out.

see, e.g.:
$ texmfind newlfm
dev-texlive/texlive-latexextra [1 file]
newlfm


or:
$ cat /usr/share/tlpkg/tlpobj/newlfm.tlpobj 
name newlfm
category Package
revision 7340
shortdesc Write letters, facsimiles, and memos.
longdesc Integrates the letter class with fancyhdr and geometry to
longdesc automatically make letterhead stationary. Useful for writing
longdesc letters, fax, and memos. You can set up an address book using
longdesc ‘wrapper’ macros. You put all the information for a person
longdesc into a wrapper and then put the wrapper in a document. The
longdesc class handles letterheads automatically. You place the object
longdesc for the letterhead (picture, information, etc.) in a box and
longdesc all sizing is set automatically.
runfiles size=35

if you have it installed with tl 2008

I couldn't find the TexLive metapackages anywhere, so I thought they were the same as CTAN.

Thanks for the info and sorry for the bogus bug then.
