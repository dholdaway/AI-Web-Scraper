Description

Hello,
with current dev-libs/libical-1.0-r2, many calendar entries with repetition entries repeat forever. Probably this is due to the change in representation of VTIMEZONE transition times that happened in libical-1.0 (cf. http://sourceforge.net/p/freeassociation/bugs/95/)

Downgrading to libical-0.48-r2 fixes the issue.

Best regards,
Bernd

Reproducible: Always

Did you try rebuilding evolution-data-server *after* updating to the new libical?

Yes, the sequence of up- or downgrading plus emerge @preserved-rebuild compiles EDS and others against the new libical, no problems with that...

Doesn't occur any longer with gnome-extra/evolution-data-server-3.12.2, so unless somebody else has problems it can probably be closed.
Thanks!
