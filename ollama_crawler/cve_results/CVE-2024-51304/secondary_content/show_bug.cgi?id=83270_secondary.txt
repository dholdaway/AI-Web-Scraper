When I try to open the font installer in kcontrol (kde-3.3.2) I get the following message:

"There was an error loading the module.
Details
The diagnostics is:
/usr/kde/3.3/lib/libkfontinst.so.0: undefined symbol: FTC_SBit_Cache_Lookup
Possible reasons:
An error occurred during your last KDE upgrade leaving an orphaned control module
You have old third party modules lying around.
Check these points carefully and try to remove the module mentioned in the error message. If this fails, consider contacting your distributor or packager."

I have tried updating freetype to 2.1.5-r1, but that hasn't made a difference.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
2.
3.



Expected Results:  
OPened the font installer.

I upgraded to KDE 3.3.2-r2 and reinstalled freetype and I now have kfontinst at least half working.  However I still get no font previews in any part of KDE - not Konqueror, not KFontView, not anywhere.

In addition I seem to find fonts become visisble and invisible to applications in a fairly random way.  For instance at the moment OpenOffice cannot see any of the Hiroshige fonts, although they are visible to Abiword and Kword, but I don't notice any others obviously missing.  I have tried installing Hiroshige in both ~/.fonts and /usr/share/fonts/TTF, but it doesn't make any difference. However yesterday OpenOffice could see Hiroshige, whereas the day before a whole wodge of fonts were missing from all my applications (although they were not the same fonts for each application).

Are you still having this problem?
I have no idea of what can be causing this...
