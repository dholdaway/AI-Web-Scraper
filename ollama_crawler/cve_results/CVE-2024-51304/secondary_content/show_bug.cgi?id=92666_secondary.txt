I can't get network to work.  i suspect that there is no driver
for my SiS900 ethernet adaptor.  or, maybe it's the broadcast
ip address, which i m trying to find out from my broadband
provider.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.i tried to ping my other pc, but it cant be reached.
2.also i cant link to anything
3.

Actual Results:  
 nothing

Expected Results:  
pls describe how i can check if my network is working or
SiS900 driver is ok.

this bug reporting format is excellent.  u ll hear a lot more
from me of problems that i cant solve with other linux distributions.

Yes, the SIS900 drivers work fine... I can confirm this.

I'd suggest you have a look at the Linux Networking HOWTO http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/NET3-4-HOWTO-5.html#ss5.4

I can't help you much here... as you've provided practically NO information.

What is this SIS900 ethernet card plugged into?  (e.g. cable modem, private LAN?)  If it plugs into a cable or DSL modem, then yes... your internet provider should be able to help you (although they might just come back with "We Don't Support Linux").  Otherwise, it's not their issue -- it's something you have to work out.

If you have IRC going (obviously you have an internet connection ... otherwise this bug wouldn't exist), I'd suggest popping onto #gentoo (irc.freenode.net) and pestering the people there.  Also... google is your friend... I'm sure "Linux SIS900" and "Linux Home Networking" will produce useful results. :-)

Bugzilla is not a good place for such problems. Please, ask in the forums:
