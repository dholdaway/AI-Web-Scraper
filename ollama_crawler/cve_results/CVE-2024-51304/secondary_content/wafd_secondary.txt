 Exhibit 99.1                Tuesday, October 17, 2023FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEWaFd's Annual Earnings Per Share Increased 10% For 2023 Even After Net Interest Margin Contraction and Outsized Provision For Credit Losses SEATTLE, WASHINGTON – WaFd, Inc. (Nasdaq: WAFD) (the "Company"), parent company of WaFd Bank (the "Bank"), today announced record annual earnings of $257,426,000 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $21,096,000 from earnings of $236,330,000 for the year ended September 30, 2022. After the effect of dividends on preferred stock, net income available for common shareholders was $3.72 per share for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, a $0.33 or 9.7% increase from $3.39 for the prior fiscal year. Return on common shareholders' equity for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, was 11.69% compared to 11.70% for the year ended September 30, 2022. Return on assets for the year ended September 30, 2023, was 1.18% compared to 1.17% for the prior year.  President and CEO Brent Beardall commented, “This past year was a roller-coaster for the banking industry. At WaFd, despite the ups and downs in the industry, the year culminated in record net income and earnings per share for the Company. We are grateful to our bankers for their efforts and to our clients for the trust that led to these results.  I am most pleased that for the year our total deposits increased, and the percentage of uninsured deposits decreased to 26%.   In a year that saw the second and third largest bank failures in the history of the United States and net outflows of deposits in the banking industry, we view the fact that we were able to achieve net deposit growth as a meaningful accomplishment. One of the commonalities of the failed banks in 2023 was a high percentage of uninsured deposits (70 to 95%), so having only 26% of uninsured deposits at  WaFd is a nice contrast.      1The following information was filed by Washington Federal Inc (WAFD) on Wednesday, October 18, 2023 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.

 Inside Washington Federal Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
While the Company believes the judgments and assumptions used in the goodwill impairment test are reasonable, different assumptions or changes in general industry, market and macro-economic conditions could change the estimated fair values and, therefore, future impairment charges could be required, which could be material to the consolidated financial statements.



 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Management does not expect the resulting expense to be material to its financial results given the Company's low level of uninsured deposits.

 Other - Other   Highlight
During 2023, the average balance of loans receivable increased $2,011,903,000 or 13.3%, while the combined average balances of mortgage backed securities, other investment securities and cash decreased by $536,288,000 or 14.7%.
