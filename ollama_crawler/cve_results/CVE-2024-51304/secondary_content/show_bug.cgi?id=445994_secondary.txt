The npapi-sdk-0.27.1 release changes the API in a destructive manner, breaking random applications. Please check whether your ebuild is compatible with >0.27 (and close the bug if so), or change the dependency to:

  <net-misc/npapi-sdk-0.27.1

Does the incompatibility manifest at build time or at runtime?

Build-time. An awful, fatal build error about prototype mismatch.

So I built it against npap-sdk-0.27.2 and it gave me no errors. Possibly the other maintainers would appreciate if you do a test build for them.
