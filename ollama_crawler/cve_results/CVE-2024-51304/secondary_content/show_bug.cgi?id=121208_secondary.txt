Hi. I think that documentations should be under 'doc' flag. I dont want any documentation and it isn't needed to compile it. For example xorg-docs (and all that *proto? dunno, not sure). But I'm sure it needs lot of free space ...

# qsize xorg-docs
app-doc/xorg-docs-1.0.1: 7 files, 4 non-files, 39.566 KB

... for nothing.

Could you do it? Do you think it is good idea?

Uhm, you definitely need protocol headers, that's not a documentation and it's completely unrelated to USE=doc...

Do what exactly? What's the output of 'equery f xorg-docs' on your USE=-doc system?

Okay, proto was mistake.

$ qlist xorg-docs # same as 'equery f' but MUCH faster
/usr/share/man/man7/security.7.gz
/usr/share/man/man7/X.7.gz
/usr/share/man/man7/Consortium.7.gz
/usr/share/man/man7/Xprint.7.gz
/usr/share/man/man7/XOrgFoundation.7.gz
/usr/share/man/man7/Standards.7.gz
/usr/share/man/man7/XProjectTeam.7.gz

Do what? Xorg-docs move under doc flag in xorg-x11-7.0, that is all :-)

manpages are NOT docs... Use FEATURES="noman" if you don't want manpages.

Then it have got bad name: xorg-mans are NOT xorg-docs. And thanks for FEATURE, I don't knew it.
