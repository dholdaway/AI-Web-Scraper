Description


Yasha Davidov





          2006-01-11 16:09:19 UTC
        

It seems that stay on top feature of fluxbox is broken in 0.9.14-r1. 
When I try to run mplayer window on top it becomes fullscreen.

1. Run mplayer.
2. Press "T".
(or run mplayer -ontop ...)

mplayer shows message "Stay on top: enabled", but window is fullscreened.

Maybe this is somehow related to http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=118643 .
