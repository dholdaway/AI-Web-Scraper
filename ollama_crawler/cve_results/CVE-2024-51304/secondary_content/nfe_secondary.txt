  Exhibit 99.1111 W 19th Street, 8th FloorNew York, NY 10011New Fortress Energy Announces Record Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 ResultsFebruary 29, 2024NEW YORK -- New Fortress Energy Inc. (Nasdaq: NFE) (“NFE” or the “Company”) today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and for the year ended December 31, 2023.Summary Highlights•Adjusted EBITDA(1) of $388 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $1.3 billion in the full year 2023  •Net income of $215 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $549 million in the full year 2023•Adjusted EPS(2) of $1.01 on a fully diluted basis in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $2.75 in the full year 2023•EPS of $1.06 on a fully diluted basis in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $2.65 in the full year 2023•Funds from Operations per share(3) of $1.36 on a fully diluted basis in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $3.56 in the full year 2023; Funds from Operations(3) is calculated as Net income attributable to stockholders(2) plus Depreciation and amortization, and the Company believes this is an important metric of our quarterly and annual performance "This year was a record by all of our reported metrics and importantly, during the second half of the year, there was no profit from Cargo Sales recorded. In other words, all of our performance was a result of downstream operating results. This is a major change in the Company’s performance, and a significant and meaningful improvement in both the quality and quantity of our results." said Wes Edens, NFE president and chief executive officer. Operational HighlightsIn Brazil, we completed the Barcarena and Santa Catarina terminals and placed them into service(4) in February 2024. This marks a significant milestone as it now fully opens our Brazil operations, and we expect to begin generating revenue in March 2024. The Brazilian gas and power markets are growing significantly, and our terminals give us significant opportunities to grow and expand our Company.  In Puerto Rico, we completed the installation of two FEMA Power plants in 2023, totaling 350 MW of capacity. These have become cornerstone plants in the Puerto Rico power complex and were dispatched approximately 99% of the time since installation. In Fast LNG, we successfully placed our first unit into its location and are now expecting first LNG(5) in March and First Cargo(5) in April 2024. We also secured financing commitments of $700 million(6) for our second FLNG project located onshore Altamira, Mexico, and expect to complete construction in the first quarter of 2026.(7)Financial HighlightsIn 2023, we generated significant increases in Funds from Operations per share(2), more than doubling compared to the full year 2022. Our Illustrative Goal is to nearly double these metrics again in the full year 2024.(8)(9) At the same time, our Gross(10) and Net Capex(11) peaked and are expected to decline significantly from prior years beginning in 2024 and beyond. The following information was filed by New Fortress Energy Llc (NFE) on Thursday, February 29, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.
