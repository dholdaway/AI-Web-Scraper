Description

I update perl,  and fetchyahoo crashed (segment violation).  I ran perl-cleaner, fetchyahoo was still crashing.  I manually emerged many different perl libraries, fetchyahoo was still crashing.  I tracked the crash down through the perl libraries until I found Crypt-SSLeay and Net-SSLeay were the source of the crash.  I updated them (to latest) and the problem went away.  

Either this is a problem with the older version of the SSLeay packages I was using  (and perl needs a dependency?) or perl-cleaner didn't do the right thing.  
or at least thats my guess!

Reproducible: Didn't try

If something crashes, you need to post exact ebuild version, some errors and emerge --info. perl-cleaner is not there to upgrade anything or to fix any crashes, it simply recompiles installed perl modules after upgrading perl versions.
