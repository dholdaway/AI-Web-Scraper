Description

every version of eudev in tree is in conflict with the kmod static-nodes creation:

*kmod-14-r1 (23 Jul 2013)

  23 Jul 2013; Samuli Suominen <ssuominen@gentoo.org> +kmod-14-r1.ebuild,
  kmod-9999.ebuild, metadata.xml, +files/static-nodes:
  Import support for kmod tmpfiles.d static device node creation wrt #477856 by
  Alexander Vershilov

this patch should go in to remove the conflict:

http://cgit.freedesktop.org/systemd/systemd/commit/src/udev/udevd.c?id=edeb68c53f1cdc452016b4c8512586a70b1262e3

This has been address.  Take a look at

https://github.com/gentoo/eudev/commit/aa417a4d83999f6d7f092161d5c411b8cbce9977

I'll be testing it with eudev-9999 (which I still need to dep on >=kmod-14) and then I'll push out eudev-1.2.

I actually reverted blueness' commit, because there is no conflict in a proper configuration:

#1 - kmod+tmpfiles must be executed before udevd starts, no matter what flavour of udev is being used.

#2 - sys-fs/eudev (and older sys-fs/udev for that matter) only create static devnodes if they don't already exist.  Otherwise they just silently update mtime and do nothing.  Because of #1 , this means eudev will not conflict with kmod+tmpfiles operation

The fact that sys-fs/eudev will create static nodes if a user chooses not to include the kmod+tmpfiles commands in openrc (or their favourite rc system) is desired behaviour for our package and not something we want to disable just because systemd decided to.  Once kmod+tmpfiles starts in sysinit, prior to udev-init-scripts, there will be no conflict.
