When emerging amarok 1.4.0a, it crashes/inf-loops on launch. But you just need to re-emerge taglib to make it work. I don't know if a re-emerge can be put in an ebuild, but it sholud, in this case.

Uhm, no, we can't re-emerge something from withing ebuilds. You should run revdep-rebuild to check/fix such problems after upgrading.

Had the same problem. And that took some time to understand what's happening...
revdep-rebuild doesn't complain. and when I reemerge taglib amarok runs fine

Same here. No complaints by revdep-rebuilt, yet amarok crashes on start. Reemerging taglib fixes it.
