Package cblas was not found in the pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing `cblas.pc'
to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
Package 'cblas', required by 'GSL', not found

Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
installed software in a non-standard prefix.

Alternatively, you may set the environment variables INKSCAPE_CFLAGS
and INKSCAPE_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.
See the pkg-config man page for more details.

I had the same problem due to broken /usr/lib/pkgconfig/cblas.pc symlink, perhaps something messed up during update.

Rerun eselect cblas set <whatever-version-you-want>.
This solved a problem for me.
