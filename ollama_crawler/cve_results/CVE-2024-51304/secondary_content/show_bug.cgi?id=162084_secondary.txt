After the upgrade to mozilla-firefox-2.0.0.1-r2 the about: pages (about:, about:plugins, about:mozilla, about:config) don't work anymore. They all fail with a "XML interpretation error" and show the "bad XML" yellow page instead of the expected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. upgrade to www-client/mozilla-firefox-2.0.0.1-r2
2. type 'about:', 'about:plugins', 'about:config' or 'about:mozilla' in the location bar

Actual Results:  
A page with an XML error

Expected Results:  
The expected "special page"
