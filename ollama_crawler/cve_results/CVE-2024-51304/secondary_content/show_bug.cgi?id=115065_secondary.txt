i moved .mozilla/firefox/m4cpo232.default/history.dat out of the way, so a
starting firefox created it again.
the history is saved into it.
the bug stands.

So the history is correctly saved (Menu "Go" => "History"), but, after
restarting Firefox, the visited links are not anymore styled as such, and there
is no address bar completion to visited URLs?

I can't reproduce this problem.

Did you try with a new profile, instead of just removing your history.dat file?
(move or rename your whole ~/.mozilla directory).

Did you try with www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.5? (the binary version).

Do you use some Firefox extensions? which?

About the visited links styling, didn't the websites you visited use the same
style for visited and non-visited links? Try with the main menu of
http://www.w3.org/

dom inspector 1.8
tabbrowser preferences 1.2.8.7

i've found the problem.
i had "preferences/privacy/history/remember visited pages for the last" set to
300 days.
i changed that to 30, and firefox did not forget my history after restart.
so i changed it back again, and it works now with 300 days.
