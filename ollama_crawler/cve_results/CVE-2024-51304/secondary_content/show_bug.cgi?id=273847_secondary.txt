When I try to start installed media-video/minitube-0.2.1 I see no GUI, error log or anything, instead of Segmentation fault.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set ~x86 keyowrd for media-video/minitube
2. Install media-video/minitube
3. Try to execute "minitube" in terminal

Actual Results:  
Minitube won't start, just returns "Segmentation fault"

Gcc version might be an issue here. Another bug appeared and it seems to be related to gcc and/or glibc version

I 'll contact upstream for this bug as well

My GCC profile is i686-pc-linux-gnu-4.3.2 and glibc version is 2.8_p20080602-r1

I see

This combination seems to break this application

Works fine for me . I use gcc-4.3.3 and glibc-2.10

This is another bug which proves that having a mixed system is not always safe :)

Mixed system? I'm using the last stable versions of gcc and glibc. As I see glibc 2.10 and glibc-4.3.3 are masked by keyword.

Mixed as in "keyworded (~arch) applications on stable systems". Anyway :)
I have a spare stable system so I can perform some tests

Is your qt compiled with accessibility use flag enabled?

It is not duplicated bug. I compile minitube with success. And I have qt-gui compiled with accessibility flag enabled.

But just can't start it :)

I cant reproduce it even If I compile the package using gcc-4.1.2 :/

A meaningful stack backtrace of the segfault would really be helpful...

Can you reproduce this bug using minitube-0.3?




Comment 14


Kiril Vladimirov





          2009-06-16 22:45:21 UTC
        

Yes. And even after I've added -ggdb in CFLAGS and added nostrip option(-split -strip BUILD_OPTIONS in paludis) there is no any other output than "Segmentation fault"

With your debug version, please use gdb to produce a backtrace and attach it here. The steps required are described in the guide linked to in comment #12.

According to the output , you are using svn version of media-sound/phonon. Is that right?

Yep. The whole my kde is compiled from svn.(kde-scm from genkdesvn repo). Is this means, I can't have minitube?

This means that we are not able to support live packages since the source code is changing every now and then.

I forgot to say that "worksforme" is because it works with stable and unstable versions of media-sound/phonon. As I said we cant support and fix bugs that occur due to live packages usage




Comment 21

          2009-06-18 18:16:48 UTC
        

I see your point, and it really makes sense. I've compiled media-sound/phonon-4.3.1 is there a way to make minitube use 4.3.1 instead of svn version?
