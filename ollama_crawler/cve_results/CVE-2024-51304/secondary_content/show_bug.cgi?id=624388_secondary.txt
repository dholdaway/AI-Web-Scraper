I updated @world and mesa-17.0.6 refuses to build.  I did --deep --newuse and with bdeps.  I tried building mesa-17.1.4, but got the same result.  I built a new kernel, using the latest stable version that emerge gave me.  The end of the build log is griping about gallium.  The USE flags are the same as I had before.
I don't know what's wrong.   I'll add all those recommended files.

It appears you haven't properly switched to GCC-5. Please read the news:

https://www.gentoo.org/support/news-items/2015-10-22-gcc-5-new-c++11-abi.html

Once you've done the rebuild, never ever switch back to pre-5.0.

If the Andreas help does not work for you, have a look at the support channels:
https://www.gentoo.org/support/

I close the ticket here, because I can not see a specific problem with an ebuild here and we can not discuss in a bug tracker.

Yes, that advice did work.  Thanks.
