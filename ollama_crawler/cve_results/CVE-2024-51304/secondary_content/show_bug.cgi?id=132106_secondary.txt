Description

this is similar to http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=108440 but it doesn't limit itself to xfce terminal. so it's not a duplicate.

i just wanted to backspace works in commandline in xfce-terminal but not under ncmpc (ncurses interface for MPD music daemon). i have to use ^H key combination instead.

same thing goes for gnome-terminal

i use pl_PL.utf8 locales

my /etc/conf.d/keymaps
-----------------------------------------
KEYMAP="pl"
SET_WINDOWKEYS="yes"
EXTENDED_KEYMAPS=""
#EXTENDED_KEYMAPS="backspace keypad euro"
DUMPKEYS_CHARSET=""
-----------------------------------------
and this is my keyboard config from xorg.conf
Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier  "Keyboard0"
        Driver      "kbd"
        Option      "AutoRepeat" "500 30"
        Option      "XkbRules" "xorg"
        Option      "XkbModel" "microsoft"
        Option      "XkbLayout" "pl"
EndSection

software:
gnome-terminal 2.14.1
xfce terminal 0.2.5.1_beta1
aterm 1.0.0-r1
konsole 3.5.2-r1
vte 0.12.0

ncmpc 0.11.1-r1

there may be more terminals involved, i'm not sure

i use a ~x86 gentoo.

This doesn't sound like an X11 bug.

well, it souns like bad terminal settings. in your Terminal preferences go to advanced, and there's what 'backspace key' generates. set it to Control-H and it should be ok. something simillar should be in gnome-terminal settings.
