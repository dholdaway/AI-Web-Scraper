Exhibit 99.19341 Courtland Drive NE, Rockford, MI 49351Phone (616) 866-5500FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASECONTACT:  Alex Wiseman(616) 863-3974WOLVERINE WORLDWIDE REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2023 RESULTS IN-LINE WITH GUIDANCE AND PROVIDES OUTLOOK FOR 2024Company Significantly Strengthens its Balance Sheet and Improves Cost Structure, Enabling an Acceleration of its Transformation to Become Great Global Brand BuildersROCKFORD, Mich., February 21, 2024 – Wolverine World Wide, Inc. (NYSE: WWW) today reported financial results for the fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 ended December 30, 2023.“We are effectively executing our transformation plan with great pace – having largely completed the stabilization phase of our turnaround,” said Chris Hufnagel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Wolverine Worldwide.  “We finished the year with revenue and earnings in-line with guidance, and inventory and debt levels better than expected. Most importantly, Wolverine Worldwide is a much different company than it was just six months ago, with a healthier balance sheet, enhanced efficiency to deliver higher profit and investment, and a redesigned organizational structure to strengthen our brand-building capabilities.  Our focused portfolio of authentic brands – supported by powerful central platforms – is focused on helping consumers live better lives through performance-led product innovation and design.  Going forward, we are accelerating our transformation of the business to ultimately drive an inflection to growth.  Our team is energized by our new vision to become global brand builders, and we are confident in our ability to drive meaningful and sustained shareholder value.”FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTSFinancial results for 2023, and comparable results from 2022, in each case, for our ongoing business exclude the impact of Keds, which was sold in February 2023, the U.S. Wolverine Leathers business, which was sold in August 2023, the non-U.S. Wolverine Leathers business, which was sold in December 2023, and reflect an adjustment for the transition of our Hush Puppies North America business to a licensing model in the second half of 2023. Tables have been provided in the back of this release showing the impact of these adjustments on financial results for 2023 and 2022. For visibility regarding this impact on our 2023 operating results, the Company has reported actual results reflecting its ongoing businesses and separately reported results for Keds, which will be limited to the period through February 3, 2023, and Wolverine Leathers to the extent it owned and operated the business.Prior to the fourth quarter of 2023, Sperry®, Keds®, and Hush Puppies® financial results were reported in the Lifestyle Group. The Lifestyle Group is no longer a reportable segment and the financial results for Sperry®, Keds®, and Hush Puppies® are included in Other. Prior period disclosures have been adjusted. 1The following information was filed by Wolverine World Wide Inc (WWW) on Wednesday, February 21, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.
