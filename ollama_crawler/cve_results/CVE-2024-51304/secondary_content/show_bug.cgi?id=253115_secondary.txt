Description

As bug #252985 shows, some users are being confused by some of the changes introduced in Portage 2.1.6.

I would like to see an announcement on atleast the main website and if possible the forums and announce mailing list too regarding the major changes in Portage 2.1.6.

As a side note to this I would like to see more such announcements in the future, made as a matter of course when major changes happen. It is commonly acknowledged by many people that I speak to that this is an area where Gentoo has significant room for improvement.

Bug #254221 also needlessly filed due to lack of an announcement.

Any chance of some movement or even just a comment on this?

It's pretty normal get bugs filed by confused users any time there's the slightest change in portage behavior. I don't think global pr announcements help much in avoiding bug reports like this. I think the existing ewarn message works pretty well (added after bug 252985 was filed). I can also do a glep 42 news item but I'm not sure if it's really necessary.

This is kind a moot point since 2.1.6.x has been stable for a long time now. Thanks anyway.
