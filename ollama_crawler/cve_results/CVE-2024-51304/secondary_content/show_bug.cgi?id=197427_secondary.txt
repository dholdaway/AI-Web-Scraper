virtualbox-bin 1.5.2 won't run neither on a i386 nor on a amd64 with the same error:

/opt/VirtualBox/VirtualBox: error while loading shared libraries: VBoxKeyboard.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Already verified that the file exists and is in the (I believe) proper place: inside /opt/VirtualBox/

It isn't a permission issue as the issue is unchanged when I try to call virtualbox as root.

please use the wrapper script and don't call the binary yourself

Ok. Sorry. My fault. I got confused by the change in the wrappers script name.
