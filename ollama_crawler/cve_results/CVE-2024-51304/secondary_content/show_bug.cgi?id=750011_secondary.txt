Even though pambase is build with USE=gnome-keyring there is no gnome keyring rules
in system-login.
I think these are missing:
-auth		optional	pam_gnome_keyring.so
-session	optional	pam_gnome_keyring.so auto_start

This should be added to a pam config used by login manager. See bug 652194 for more info.

hmm, OK. I don't see pam_gnome_keyring.so in my lightdm though. Is there
any login mgr that adds gnome_keyring ?

Yes, as stated it has nothing to do with pambase itself, rather a login manager.
