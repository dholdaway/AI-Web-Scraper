emerge --info www-server/apache result:
http://bpaste.net/show/219939/

I didn't enable mod_negotiation but /etc/apache2/modules.d/00_languages.conf is installed which uses a directive from mod_negotiation

# /etc/init.d/apache2 restart               
 * apache2 has detected an error in your setup:
AH00526: Syntax error on line 71 of /etc/apache2/modules.d/00_languages.conf:
Invalid command 'LanguagePriority', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration
 * ERROR: apache2 failed to start

That file contains

  <IfDefine LANGUAGE>

and everything is inside that define.

Any chance you have

  APACHE_OPTS="-D LANGUAGE"

set in your /etc/conf.d/apache2 file? If yes, remove the "-D LANGUAGE" string.

Yes indeed, this is the default configuration for a freshly installed Apache.

My suggestion is to generate /etc/conf.d/apache2 according to enabled use flags, like the way /etc/apache2/httpd.conf was generated.

I've tested this with latest apache-2.2 and apache-2.4 ebuilds in portage and the only way to get "-D LANGUAGE" added to APACHE2_OPTS is by enabling APACHE2_MODULES="negotiation" or setting USE="apache2_modules_negotiation".
Feel free to reopen this bug once you've figured out how to reliably reproduce the reported problem.
