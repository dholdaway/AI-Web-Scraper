Some themes using murrine requires the latest svn murrine-engine to work, so I've made this ebuild.

Its my first ebuild, so i'll appreciate any help. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
for example: http://lassekongo83.deviantart.com/art/MurrineCleanGlass-99013808
Actual Results:  
(Actually, i cant view the murrine clean glass theme in my theme list of xfce. I think that's because i'm using xfce (?). anybody know something about?)
The murrine engines is updated to the svn version

Expected Results:  
Update murrine engine to the svn version

No problem, thanks for submitting your ebuild :)

Assigning to maintainers.

By the way Leonardo, you want to use KEYWORDS="" for live ebuilds (i.e. for ebuilds checking out latest source from project repository). Also, look into using eautoreconf and econf rather than autogen.sh (http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/qa/autofailure.xml)

Hi,

I don't know how you managed to run your latest version of the ebuild, but on my box there's no eautoconf function and you don't inherit the autotools-eclass either.
I changed the ebuild, so that it works on machines with the latest stable portage version.
The only thing I couldn't fix is using _elibtoolize instead of libtoolize, I explained the issue in the ebuild, if anybody of you know how to fix it, feel free to do so (and tell what was wrong!) :-)



Geralt.

Thanks, Geralt.

I was looking for a fix to that, I'm glad you made it because the search wasn't easy. Seems that using autotools is a bit more complicated than I though.

Thanks again.

.. and no longer relevant now that 0.90.3 has been released.

Please reopen if there is some other reason for having a live ebuild
