Description

kde-frameworks/kwayland-5.49.0 fails early in build reporting a mising header file: .../src/server/wayland-output-unstable-v1-client-protocol.h

A simple visual inspection doesn't turn up anything obvious to me.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge --update kde-frameworks/kwayland
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
CMake Error in src/server/CMakeLists.txt:
  Cannot find source file:

    /var/tmp/portage/kde-frameworks/kwayland-5.49.0/work/kwayland-5.49.0_build/src/server/wayland-output-unstable-v1-client-protocol.h

  Tried extensions .c .C .c++ .cc .cpp .cxx .m .M .mm .h .hh .h++ .hm .hpp
  .hxx .in .txx


Expected Results:  
[normal build]

This is the first report of its kind.

Anything unusual about your system config that we should be aware of?

The attachments show the portage config and build logs.

I don't see anything extraordinary, a mostly testing build

Please re-open if this happens again, I was never able to reproduce this problem on any cmake version.
