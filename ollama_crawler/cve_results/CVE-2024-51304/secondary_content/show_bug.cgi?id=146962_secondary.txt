Description

I have installed fresh gentoo 2006.1 (from minimal-iso) on my hda10 (ext3 type) partition,
but booting from it fails with this error message:

  VFS: Cannot open root device "hda10" or unknown-block(0,0)
  Please append a correct "root=" boot option
  Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)

...it seems that hda10 partition is OK (it can be mounted from another system)
and I have these lines in grub.conf:

  title s3-gentoo
  root (hd0,9)
  kernel /boot/mygentoo-2.6.17-r7 root=/dev/hda10 video=radeonfb:1024x768

It seems to be kernel configuration problem, but I cannot find it...
ext2 and ext3 support was enabled and gentoo-handbook notes were satisfied

I'm going to attach my kernel .config file...

This is not a support forum, we have forums.gentoo.org and #gentoo on IRC for this. Reopen when you have proof that it's a bug.
