Exhibit 99.1Denali Therapeutics Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results and Business HighlightsSOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., – February 27, 2024 – Denali Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq: DNLI), a biopharmaceutical company developing a broad portfolio of product candidates engineered to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and lysosomal storage diseases, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, and provided business highlights."2023 was a year of significant progress across our broad therapeutic portfolio and further clinical validation of our BBB-crossing Transport Vehicle (TV) platform," said Ryan Watts, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Denali. "In 2024, we expect to complete enrollment of our late-stage trials in MPS II and ALS as we establish commercial readiness for our product candidates in our first peak of programs. In addition, we are well positioned to expand our TV-enabled portfolio to address large neurodegenerative diseases with TV-enabled enzymes, antibodies, and oligonucleotides. We recognize the urgent needs of patients and families living with neurodegenerative and lysosomal storage diseases and we will continue to push for the fastest path to approval of effective medicines."Fourth Quarter 2023 and Recent Program Updates:Late-stage and mid-stage clinical programs Tividenofusp alfa (DNL310): Enzyme Transport Vehicle (ETV)-enabled, iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS) replacement therapy in development for MPS II (Hunter syndrome)•Presented additional interim data from the open-label, single-arm Phase 1/2 study of DNL310 at the 2024 WORLDSymposiumTM. Data out to 104 weeks showed additional improvement and stabilization in multiple measures of clinical outcomes, including those of adaptive behavior, cognition, hearing, and growth trajectory. In addition, robust and sustained responses in biomarkers of neuronal health (e.g., CSF heparan sulfate, neurofilament light (NfL)) and peripheral activity (e.g., urine heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate) were observed. DNL310 continued to be generally well tolerated.•Participated in the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) workshop that brought together FDA representatives, patient advocates, clinical and basic science researchers, and industry to explore a case study of CSF heparan sulfate as a relevant substrate biomarker to support  accelerated approval in neuronopathic mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS).  •Enrollment continues in the global Phase 2/3 COMPASS study and is expected to be completed in 2024.DNL343: eIF2B activator in development for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) •Enrollment continues in Regimen G (DNL343) of the Phase 2/3 HEALEY ALS Platform Trial and is expected to be completed in 2024.SAR443820/DNL788: CNS-penetrant RIPK1 inhibitor in development for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS)•As previously announced, Sanofi informed Denali that the Phase 2 HIMALAYA study evaluating SAR443820/DNL788 in participants with ALS did not meet the primary endpoint of change in ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R). Sanofi intends to present the detailed efficacy and safety results of the ALS Phase 2 HIMALAYA study at a future scientific forum.•Sanofi is evaluating SAR443820/DNL788 in another Phase 2 clinical trial in participants with MS, and the outcome of HIMALAYA study has no impact on the ongoing MS study. 1The following information was filed by Denali Therapeutics Inc. (DNLI) on Tuesday, February 27, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.

 Inside Denali Therapeutics Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Debt   Highlight
If we incur indebtedness, we could become subject to covenants that would restrict our operations and potentially impair our competitiveness, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.



 Financial - Expense   Highlight
However, we expect that the level of judgment in estimating research and development expenses may increase over time as we are entering later stage, more extensive, clinical trials.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, incomplete or inaccurate data from vendors could impact our understanding of the status and timing of services performed which could result in us reporting expenses that are too high or too low in any particular period.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Any of the foregoing could significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects.

 Other - Other   Highlight
We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect the losses to increase as we expand our research and development activities and continue the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates, and begin to commercialize any approved products.
