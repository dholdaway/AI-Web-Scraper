Exhibit 99.1 YETI Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2023 ResultsAnnounces Two Category Expansion Acquisitions & a $300 Million Share Repurchase ProgramProvides Fiscal Year 2024 OutlookAustin, Texas, February 15, 2024 – YETI Holdings, Inc. (“YETI”) (NYSE: YETI) today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. The results below should be read in conjunction with the “Product Recall Updates” section of this press release.YETI reports its financial performance in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and as adjusted on a non-GAAP basis. YETI’s non-GAAP measures exclude the impact of the voluntary recalls, as well as certain other items. Please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” and “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Information” below for additional information and reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights•Fourth quarter net sales increased 16%; Adjusted net sales increased 6% •Fourth quarter net sales were highlighted by a 12% increase in Drinkware net sales and a 44% increase in International net sales; International adjusted net sales increased 39%•Fourth quarter EPS of $0.90 compared to loss per share of $0.32 in the prior year quarter; Adjusted EPS of $0.90, growth of 15%Fiscal Year 2023 Highlights•Full year net sales increased 4%; Adjusted net sales increased 3%•Full year EPS increased 88% to $1.94; Adjusted EPS decreased 5% to $2.25•Cash increased 87% to $439 million compared to Fiscal 2022Matt Reintjes, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “In the fourth quarter, we saw strength in a number of key areas of our business. Our Drinkware business grew 12%, pushing the category to over $1 billion in annual sales. Also, our international expansion continued in the fourth quarter, with our business outside the US growing 39%. Despite strong topline performance in these areas, our fourth quarter results were below our guidance, primarily as a result of more cautious and inconsistent spending on high-priced ticket items in our Coolers & Equipment category. Gross margins continued to expand in the fourth quarter, reaching an all-time high of over 60 percent, which supported a return of adjusted operating margin expansion. And we exited the year with our strongest balance sheet to-date, including a record cash position of nearly $440 million.”Mr. Reintjes continued, “In 2023, we continued to show the strength of our customer base, the success of our product expansion, and the momentum behind our global brand. During the year, we evolved our diverse commercial channels to market through existing and new wholesale partners, continued to make investments in our DTC channels, and further developed our international markets. We delivered a robust lineup of new product innovation while maintaining our focus on durability, performance, and design. Importantly, we broadened and extended the reach of YETI drinkware with new offerings in hydration, coffee, barware and tabletop, which resonated with both new and existing customers. Additionally, we made foundational international investments across brand awareness, logistics, and DTC to support international growth into 2024 and beyond.”1The following information was filed by Yeti Holdings, Inc. (YETI) on Thursday, February 15, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.

 Inside Yeti Holdings, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
The Credit Facility requires us to comply with certain covenants, including financial covenants regarding our total net leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio.



 Financial - Debt   Highlight
Failure to comply with these covenants and certain other provisions of the Credit Facility, or the occurrence of a change of control, could result in an event of default and an acceleration of our obligations under the Credit Facility or other indebtedness that we may incur in the future.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results may differ from these estimates and could differ based upon other assumptions or conditions.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
The ultimate costs from the approved voluntary recalls could differ materially from this estimate, and as such, changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Although such effects have not materially impacted our business to date, such conditions could worsen.
