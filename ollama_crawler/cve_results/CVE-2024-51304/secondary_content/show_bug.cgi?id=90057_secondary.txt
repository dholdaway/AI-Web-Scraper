Description

Attempting to emerge mod_auth_pam complains that all builds are masked due to the requirement of apache2. I am running the earlier version of apache, not apache2.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install apache but not apache2
2. emerge net-www/mod_auth_pam

Actual Results:  
Calculating dependencies -
!!! All ebuilds that could satisfy "=net-www/apache-2*" have been masked.
!!! One of the following masked packages is required to complete your request:
- net-www/apache-2.0.52-r1 (masked by: package.mask)
- net-www/apache-2.0.52-r3 (masked by: package.mask, ~x86 keyword)
- net-www/apache-2.0.51 (masked by: package.mask)
- net-www/apache-2.0.52-r2 (masked by: package.mask, ~x86 keyword)
- net-www/apache-2.0.53 (masked by: package.mask, ~x86 keyword)
- net-www/apache-2.0.52 (masked by: package.mask)
- net-www/apache-2.0.54 (masked by: package.mask, package.mask, ~x86 keyword)
# Christian Parpart <trapni@gentoo.org>
# It's not yet released upstream. But on the way ;)

- net-www/apache-2.0.50 (masked by: package.mask)
- net-www/apache-2.0.51-r1 (masked by: package.mask)

For more information, see MASKED PACKAGES section in the emerge man page or
section 2.2 "Software Availability" in the Gentoo Handbook.
!!!    (dependency required by "net-www/mod_auth_pam-1.1.1" [ebuild])

Expected Results:  
A successful emerge of mod_auth_pam.

the stable mod_auth_pam ebuild does not support apache 1.3, consider using 1.1.1-r1 (~arch)

The 1.1.1-r1 ebuild for mod_auth_pam is seriously broken when used with apache 1.3. The module and conf file are installed in the wrong places and the module fails to load from apache.

The module works for me when used with unstable (~arch) apache-1.
