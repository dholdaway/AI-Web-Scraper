Steps to Reproduce:
1.acroread

3.
Actual Results:

Expected Results:

I suspect you might have deleted libssl.so.0.9.8 and/or libcrypto.so.0.9.8 as per postinst message printed by OpenSSL >= 1.0 upgrade. However the message should be ignored when also installing a slotted copy. 

Try this:

# emerge -C openssl:0.9.8
# emerge -1 openssl:0.9.8

and possible 'emerge -1 app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-baselibs' for 32bit copies...

The instructions in comment 2 fixed the problem for me. Thanks
