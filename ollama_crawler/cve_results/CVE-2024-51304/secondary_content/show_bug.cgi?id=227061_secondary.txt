Description


trefoil





          2008-06-14 23:16:32 UTC
        

Fails with:

X Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
  Major opcode of failed request:  137 (DPMS)
  Minor opcode of failed request:  6 (DPMSForceLevel)
  Serial number of failed request:  27
  Current serial number in output stream:  27

Three patches from upstream fix it for me. Please apply:

Reproducible: Always

And now I can't hit this bug anymore. Weird. Maybe it was a bug in X after all. Closing. -_-
