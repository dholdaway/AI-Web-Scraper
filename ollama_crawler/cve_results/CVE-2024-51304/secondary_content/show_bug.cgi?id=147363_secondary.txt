I'm getting exactly the same error on exactly the same tests except for rpath-3bag and rpath-3bbg where I get: "/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/4.1.1/../../../../x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/bin/ld: cannot find -lrpathz" but otherwise the same.

rpath-3aaf, rpath-3abf, rpath-3bae, rpath-3baf, rpath-3bbe and rpath-3bbf were skipped.

Overall:
======================
10 of 40 tests failed
(6 tests were not run)
======================

re-open if 0.15.0 fails as well
