currently when one emerges net-misc/unison the binary is called unison-2.27 and not unison. this becomes problem when somebody wants to use unison on gentoo server since the client has hardoced unison binary and the whole synchronization end with error like:

 $ unison-2.27 a ssh://gento-server/dir_to_synchro/blabla
Contacting server...
bash: unison: command not found
Fatal error: Lost connection with the server

the workaround is to make symlink from unison-2.27 to unison on the gentoo-server side.


Reproducible: Always

check the elog message of unison and bug reports why this was introduced if you want more info.
