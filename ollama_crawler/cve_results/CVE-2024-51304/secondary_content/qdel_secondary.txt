We are encouraged by the growth in our non-respiratory business, the market share gains we are seeing in our respiratory portfolios, and the U.S. launch of our Savanna molecular platform. Our competitive positions are strong across the globe, and we believe our pipeline of innovative new products and menu expansions will continue to strengthen pull-through across our growing installed base,” said Douglas Bryant, President and Chief Executive Officer of QuidelOrtho."We identified substantially greater synergies, while investing in the business and paying down debt. For example, we completed significant manufacturing upgrades to address instrument backlogs and meet market demand in our Labs business. In our Transfusion Medicine business, we are determined to continue investing in our Immunohematology portfolio and will begin winding down the U.S. Donor Screening portfolio,” he added. “We have taken measures to reduce costs across the Company to lessen the impact of macro factors, such as inflation, the variability of the respiratory season and global supply chain constraints. Finally, we are accelerating our business efficiency initiatives, including our capital allocation strategy and portfolio management processes, to support durable long-term growth and generate shareholder value,” Bryant concluded. The following information was filed by Quidelortho Corp (QDEL) on Tuesday, February 13, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.

 Inside Quidelortho Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Despite our mitigation efforts, such disruptions and challenges have materially affected and could further materially affect our ability to timely manufacture and distribute our products and could unfavorably impact our results of operations depending on the nature and duration of such disruptions and challenges.



 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management at the time of the assessment, however, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could reduce our earnings.

 M & A - Other   Highlight
For fiscal year 2023, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to a decrease in our pre-acquisition U.S. federal reserves for uncertain tax positions due to settlement of certain tax matters partially offset by net operating losses in certain subsidiaries not being benefited due to the establishment of valuation allowances and Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”).

 Other - Other   Highlight
However, the significance and frequency of such impact have lessened during the fourth quarter of 2023.
