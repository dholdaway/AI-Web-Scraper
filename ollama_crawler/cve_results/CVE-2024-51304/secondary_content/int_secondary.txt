 Inside World Fuel Services Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Expense   Highlight
However, a significant or prolonged period of high inflation, particularly when combined with rising interest rates due to actions taken by governments to attempt to control inflation, could adversely impact our results if costs, including employee compensation driven by competitive job market conditions, were to increase at a rate greater than the increase in the revenues we generate.



 Financial - Expense   Highlight
The increase in operating expenses was partially attributable to increased compensation and employee benefit costs, the addition of Flyers' operating expenses of $66.3 million, as well as higher general and administrative costs as business activity continued to normalize.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
However, to the extent that a rising cost environment impacts our results, there are typically offsetting benefits either inherent in certain parts of our business or that may result from proactive measures we take to reduce the impact of inflation on our net operating results.

 M & A - Other   Highlight
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to net borrowings of $333.6 million, primarily driven by incremental borrowings under our Credit Facility related to the acquisition of Flyers and increased working capital requirements, partially offset by $48.7 million in purchases of our common stock and dividend payments of $31.0 million.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
These benefits can include higher commodity prices that typically result in a constrained credit environment, often creating favorable market conditions that increase demand for our services, as well as our ability to renegotiate prices due to many of our sales contracts being 12 months or less in duration.
