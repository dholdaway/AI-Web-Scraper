In IRC, I was wondering if start-stop-daemon should pass user-defined environment variables from /etc/env.d to the processes it starts. Currently s-s-d only passes environment variables from a built-in whitelist. It might be nice if there was some way to affect what s-s-d passes to its child processes, or to affect the way s-s-d is called from init scripts.

@djc:
For the record, in our conversation on IRC, we found a couple of things.

The first thing we discovered is that runscript reads variables from
profile.env and adds them to the environment, so the service script has
access to all of those environment variables.

Also, we found that the -e or --env start-stop-daemon command line
option can be used to pass environment variables through from the
service script to start-stop-daemon.

Do you feel that we need to keep this open?

@openrc team:
Does anyone think we should pass runscript's environment untouched
through to start-stop-daemon and its child processes?

I am closing this since there has been no activity on it for quite some
time. If you think it is still an issue that we need to look into
further, please re-open the bug.
