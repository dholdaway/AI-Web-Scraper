It works fine on my x86 server and there were never bugs other then enhancements. 1.1 is in the tree since August 06, it's about time it gets stable ;) Thanks!

As Ticho pointed out on IRC, when using the -p option, the .cache files used for indexing aren't read properly resulting in empty indexes, which makes it pretty much useless. Postponing stablization request until I figure out a fix.
