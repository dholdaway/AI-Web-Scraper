If I download the specified file from the http://gentoo.inf.elte.hu mirror, the download stops before the downloading completes. I tried the portage-latest and the stage3-i686 package. This don't happen if I use the ftp protocoll on the same server.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download the file

Actual Results:  
Download stopped before the end.

Expected Results:  
Successful download
