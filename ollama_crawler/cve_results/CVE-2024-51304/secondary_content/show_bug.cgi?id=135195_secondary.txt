Jeeves was inaccurate about the most recent time chaosite had been seen:

From #gentoo:

14:26 <kale> !seen chaosite
14:26 <jeeves> chaosite (n=chaosite@87.69.59.168.cable.012.net.il) was last seen
 joining #gentoo-commits 1 day, 5 hours, 15 minutes ago. chaosite is still on #g
entoo-commits.
...
14:27 <DrChandra> Um, coulda swore I saw chaosite in here a few hours ago.
...
14:27 <@kojiro> DrChandra: me too
...
14:28 <DrChandra> Yeah 3.5 hours ago
...
