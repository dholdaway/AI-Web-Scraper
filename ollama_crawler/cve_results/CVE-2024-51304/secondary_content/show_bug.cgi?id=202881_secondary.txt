This issue does not occur running screened multitail in urxvt and xfce Terminal or if running multiuser screen with one of those terminals e.g.  'screen -rx mtail-in-split-screen' multi session between gnome-terminal and urxvt. 

--[ To Reproduce ]--
Start screen in gnome-terminal, split and run multitail in a screen window, resize multitail's window smaller than necessary to draw help|edit|whatever window. Type <e> or <F1>  to invoke multitail ui, quit ui, invoke again.
