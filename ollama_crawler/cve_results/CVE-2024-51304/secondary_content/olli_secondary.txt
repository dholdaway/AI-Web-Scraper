•

Net income increased 44.1% to $76.5 million, or $1.23 per diluted share, as compared with net income of $53.1 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, in the prior year.



 




•

Adjusted net income(1) increased 45.5% to $76.3
                  million, or $1.23 per diluted share, as compared with prior year adjusted net income of $52.4 million, or $0.84 per diluted share.

“Our record fourth quarter capped off a great year for Ollie’s. For the full fiscal year 2023, we generated record revenues, increased gross margin 370 basis points, and
        grew adjusted earnings per share by 80%. In addition to our strong financial performance, we also opened our 500th store, entered our 30th state, added a record 3.6 million new Ollie’s Army members, and returned to a pattern
        of consistent execution and growth,” said John Swygert, President and Chief Executive Officer.

Mr. Swygert continued, “We recently completed our latest third-party real estate feasibility study, which utilizes demographic data and density across a changing U.S.
        landscape. The migration trend out of larger metropolitan markets into rural and suburban areas is a positive trend for Ollie’s and the study concludes that we could operate as many as 1,300 stores nationwide, up from a previous target of 1,050.”


“Looking ahead, we feel very good about our underlying business trends and the growth opportunities in front of us. Investments in people, process, and systems are
        driving productivity across the organization. With our increasing size and scale, we are becoming more meaningful to our vendor partners which is driving strong deal flow. Everybody loves a bargain and as consumers seek value, we are positioned to
        win,” Mr. Swygert concluded.

Fourth Quarter Results


Net sales increased 18.0% to $648.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared with net sales of $549.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. 
        The increase in net sales was the result of new store unit growth in addition to a comparable store sales increase of 3.9%, and $34.0 million of sales in the 53rd week. Excluding the
        53rd week, sales increased 11.9% year over year.


Gross profit increased 27.4% to $263.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 from $206.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Gross margin increased
        290 basis points to 40.5% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 from 37.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to favorable supply chain costs and slightly higher merchandise margin primarily related
        to lower shrink.
 

Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 19.1% to $156.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 from $131.0 million in the fourth quarter of
        fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily driven by higher selling expenses related to new store openings and higher incentive compensation.  As a percentage of net sales, SG&A increased 30 basis points to 24.1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal
        2023 compared to 23.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily the result of higher incentive compensation, partially offset by leverage of fixed expenses on the increase in net sales.

Operating income increased 44.3% to $97.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 from $67.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.  Operating margin
        increased 270 basis points to 15.0% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 from 12.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.


Net income increased 44.1% to $76.5 million, or $1.23 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 compared with net income of $53.1 million, or $0.85 per
        diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.  Adjusted net income(1) increased 45.5% to $76.3 million, or $1.23 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 from $52.4 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, in the fourth
        quarter of fiscal 2022.


Adjusted EBITDA(1) increased 43.2% to $110.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023  from $77.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. 
        Adjusted EBITDA  margin(1) increased 300 basis points to 17.0% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 from 14.0% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.  Adjusted EBITDA excludes non-cash
        stock-based compensation expense.


Fiscal 2023 Results


Net sales increased 15.1% to $2.103 billion in fiscal 2023 as compared with net sales of $1.827 billion in fiscal 2022. The increase in net sales was the result of new
        store unit growth, a comparable store sales increase of 5.7%, and $34.0 million of sales in the 53rd week. Excluding the 53rd week, sales increased 13.2% year over year.


Gross profit increased 26.9% to $832.4 million in fiscal 2023 from $656.1 million in fiscal 2022.  Gross margin increased 370 basis points to 39.6% in fiscal 2023 from
        35.9% in fiscal 2022. The increase in gross margin is primarily due to favorable supply chain costs.
 

Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 14.7% to $562.7 million in fiscal 2023 from $490.6 million in fiscal 2022. Excluding the gains from insurance
        settlements, adjusted SG&A increased 14.5% to $562.7 million in fiscal 2023 from $491.5 million in fiscal 2022. This increase was primarily driven by higher selling expenses associated with our new store unit growth, as well as higher incentive
        compensation.  As a percentage of net sales, SG&A, exclusive of insurance settlement gains, decreased 10 basis points to 26.8% in fiscal 2023 from 26.9% in fiscal 2022. This decrease is primarily the result of leverage of fixed expenses on the
        increase in net sales, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense.


Operating income increased 74.0% to $227.8 million in fiscal 2023 from $130.9 million in fiscal 2022.  Adjusted operating income(1), which excludes gains
        from insurance settlements increased 75.2% to $227.8 million in fiscal 2023 compared with $130.0 million in fiscal 2022. Adjusted operating margin(1) increased 370 basis points to 10.8% in fiscal 2023 from 7.1% in fiscal 2022 primarily
        as a result of the increase in gross profit.


Net income increased 76.5% to $181.4 million, or $2.92 per diluted share, in fiscal 2023 from $102.8 million, or $1.64 per diluted share, in fiscal 2022.  Diluted
        earnings per share in fiscal 2023 included a benefit of $0.02, due to excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.  Adjusted net income(1), which excludes these benefits and the after-tax gains from the insurance settlements,
        increased 77.1% to $180.4 million, or $2.91 per diluted share, in fiscal 2023 from $101.8 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, in fiscal 2022.


Adjusted EBITDA (1) totaled $275.2 million in fiscal 2023, a 62.9% increase from $168.9 million in fiscal 2022.  Adjusted EBITDA margin(1)
        increased 390 basis points to 13.1% in fiscal 2023 from 9.2% in fiscal 2022.

Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights


The Company's cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $353.2 million as of the end of fiscal 2023 compared with $270.8 million as of the end of
        fiscal 2022.  The Company had no borrowings outstanding under its $100 million revolving credit facility and $90.0 million of availability under the facility as of the end of fiscal 2023. The Company extended its existing revolving credit facility
        for an additional five-year term in the fourth quarter of 2023 at favorable rates to current market conditions.


During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company invested $12.7 million of cash to repurchase 174 thousand shares of its common stock, resulting in $52.5 million
        invested in fiscal 2023. As of February 3, 2024, $85.7 million remained available for future share repurchases under the Company’s existing share repurchase program authorization.


Inventories as of the end of fiscal 2023 increased 7.5% to $505.8 million compared with $470.5 million as of the end of fiscal 2022, driven by new store growth,
        partially offset by the impact of lower capitalized freight costs.


Capital expenditures were $124.4 million in fiscal 2023, primarily related to the development of new stores, the remodeling of existing stores, the completion of the
        Company’s distribution center expansion in York, PA, and the development of the Company’s new distribution center in Princeton, IL.
 
Fiscal 2024 Outlook


Our outlook for the fiscal year ending February 1, 2025 (“fiscal 2024”) reflects a 52 week year versus 53 weeks in fiscal 2023. The Company estimates the following for
        the fiscal year ending February 1, 2025:
 



 
 

 New

 



New store openings, net of two closures

 
 

48

 



Net sales

 

$2.248 to $2.273 billion

 



Comparable store sales increase

 

1.0% to 2.0%

 



Gross margin

 
 

40.0%








Operating income

 

$243 to $251 million

 



Adjusted net income(1)(2)

 

$192 to $198 million

 



Adjusted net income per diluted share(1)(2)

 





$3.10 to $3.20

 



Annual effective tax rate (excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation)

 
 

25.0%

62 million

 



Capital expenditures

(1)


The outlook ranges as provided for adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share exclude the excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation as the Company cannot predict such estimates without unreasonable
                  effort.




(2)


The earnings outlook noted above includes interest income of approximately $13.0 million. This assumes the potential for lower interest rates in the second half of fiscal 2024.

Supplemental Information
 
Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
(Dollars in thousands)
 
(Unaudited)
 
The Company reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP.  We have included the non-GAAP measures of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted
        operating income, adjusted net income, and adjusted net income per diluted share in this press release as these are key measures used by our management and our board of directors to evaluate our operating performance and the effectiveness of our
        business strategies, make budgeting decisions, and evaluate compensation decisions.  Management believes it is useful to investors and analysts to evaluate these non-GAAP measures on the same basis as management uses to evaluate the Company’s
        operating results. We believe that excluding items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, our core operating results, and that may vary in frequency or magnitude from net income and net income per diluted share, enhances the
        comparability of our results and provides a better baseline for analyzing trends in our business.
 
The tables below reconcile the most directly comparable GAAP measure to non-GAAP financial measures: operating income to adjusted operating income,
        net income to adjusted net income, net income per diluted share to adjusted net income per diluted share, and net income to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.


Adjusted operating income excludes gains from insurance settlements; adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share exclude gains from insurance
        settlements, adjustments to the provisions for income taxes and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, each of which may not occur with the same frequency or magnitude in future periods. We define EBITDA as net income before net
        interest income or expense, depreciation and amortization expenses, and income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as further adjusted for gains from insurance settlements and non-cash stock-based compensation expense.
 
Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative to or substitute for, the Company’s financial results
        prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of the items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the Company's financial position, results of operations, and cash flows and should
        therefore be considered in assessing the Company's actual financial condition and performance. The methods used by the Company to calculate its non-GAAP financial measures may differ significantly from methods used by other companies to compute
        similar measures. As a result, any non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.
