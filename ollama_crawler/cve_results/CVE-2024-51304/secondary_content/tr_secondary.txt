Exhibit 99.1​TOOTSIE ROLL INDUSTRIES, INC.​​7401 South Cicero Avenue​Chicago, IL 60629​Phone 773/838-3400​Fax 773/838-3534​PRESS RELEASE​​​STOCK TRADED: NYSEFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASETICKER SYMBOL: TRFriday, February 16, 2024​​CHICAGO, ILLINOIS – February 16, 2024 - Ellen R. Gordon, Chairman, Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc. reported fourth quarter and twelve months 2023 net sales and net earnings. ​Fourth quarter 2023 net sales were $195,368,000 compared to $188,180,000 in fourth quarter 2022, an increase of $7,188,000 or 4%. Fourth quarter 2023 net earnings were $29,403,000 compared to $25,344,000 in fourth quarter 2022, and net earnings per share were $0.42 and $0.36 in fourth quarter 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of $0.06 per share or 17%. ​Twelve months 2023 net sales were $763,252,000 compared to $681,440,000 in twelve months 2022, an increase of $81,812,000 or 12%. Twelve months 2023 net earnings were $91,912,000 compared to $75,937,000 in twelve months 2022, and net earnings per share were $1.32 and $1.07 in twelve months 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of $0.25 per share or 23%. ​Mrs. Gordon said, “Sales growth in fourth quarter and twelve months 2023 was driven by effective sales and marketing programs, including seasonal sales programs during these periods. Higher sales price realization contributed to the sales increase in fourth quarter and twelve months 2023. The timing of earlier pre-Halloween and other sales in third quarter 2023 had some adverse effect on fourth quarter 2023 sales when compared to the comparative prior year 2022 quarterly periods.​Although the increase in fourth quarter and twelve months 2023 sales contributed to improved net earnings, significantly higher input costs offset much of the benefits of these higher sales. Fourth quarter and twelve months 2023 gross profit margins and net earnings were adversely affected by higher costs for ingredients, packaging materials, labor and benefits, and plant manufacturing operating supplies, services, utilities and repairs and maintenance. We also incurred additional costs, including overtime and extended operating shifts, for plant manufacturing to meet our sales demands in 2023. ​Our input unit costs for ingredients, packaging materials and many manufacturing supplies and services moved significantly higher in 2023 from 2022 as new supply agreements at higher prices became effective in early 2023. These higher costs in 2023 are incremental to the significant increase in many input costs that we experienced in prior year 2022 when compared to 2021. We believe that the increases in ingredients and packaging materials costs from 2021 through 2023 are the greatest that we have experienced over any two-year period in decades. Limited supply and continuing high demand for materials, as well as some elevated commodity markets and overall inflation, drove up our unit costs for many of our inputs in each of the past two years. The Company uses the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) method of accounting for inventory and costs of goods sold which results in lower current income taxes during such periods of increasing costs and higher inflation, but this method does charge the most current costs to cost of goods sold and thereby accelerates the realization of these higher costs.​The following information was filed by Tootsie Roll Industries Inc (TR) on Tuesday, February 20, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.
