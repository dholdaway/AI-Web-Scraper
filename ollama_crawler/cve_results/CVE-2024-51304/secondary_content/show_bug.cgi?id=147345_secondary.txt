Description

Not sure if this is related to new glibc or not... I just pulled down new glibc and did my usual short rebuild routine (note I was already running earlier version of 2.4.90-2006xxyy):

emerge linux-headers binutils glibc coreutils gcc

This worked fine, no errors.  Note the order - gcc was definitely last and is working (or seems to be).

Then, I went for the rebuild emerge -e system (which I usually follow with emerge -e world just to be safe). 

On the first rebuilt (emerge -e system) the (re)compilation of gcc-4.1.1 seg faulted.  I will attach output from emerge -e system where it seg faulted, as well as the gcc log file and my emerge --info since the bugzilla is saying my emerge --info by iteself is too long to submit here!!!!

the gcc preprocessor output was too big to attach, so I am putting it on my site temporarily...it can be found here:  http://jefferynorman.com/shared/ccdVRXqU.out
