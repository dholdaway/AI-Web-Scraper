Build log from app-emulation/open-vm-tools

Error compiling app-emulation/open-vm-tools. Looks like in line 74 two variables are not defined leading to executing "-h".

Same here, seems like 'rpcgen' is missing from system and configure doesn't check for it.

Fixed by updating rpcsvc-proto to latest version 'net-libs/rpcsvc-proto-1.3.1-r1'.

Side note: 'rpcgen' was removed in glibc-2.26 and later.

For reference: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Glibc_2.26_porting_notes/RPC_implementation

The ebuild already depends on rpcsvc-proto, which depends on glibc[rpc] or provides rpcgen itself. I'm not sure how you got into a state where you don't have rpcgen installed.
