Version 0.3_pre20060424 has a bug where it cannot determine the correct aspect ratio for recordings.  Using version 0.3_pre20060424 results in divison by zero errors.

Version 0.3_pre20060426 has a fix for this bug.  In the new version, an aspect ratio of 4:3 is used by default.

Attached is an ebuild for the new release.  This ebuild nearly identical to the ebuild for the 0.3_pre20060424.

SRC_URI should be: http://forevermore.net/files/nuvexport/archive/nuvexport-0.3-0.20060626.svn.tar.bz2

And according to the .spec in the archive nuvexport no longer requires lve and avidemux. These were used to remove commercial from mpeg2 stream, but this can now be done inside mythtv.

I think nuvexport-0.3_pre20060729 fixes all this so you can close this bug
