The example in the Handbook should be updated to include -v option of md5sum to
give "OK" as in example.
Currently reads:
# md5sum -c stage1-x86-2005.0.tar.bz2.md5
stage1-x86-2005.0.tar.bz2: OK
Suggested change:
# md5sum -cv stage1-x86-2005.0.tar.bz2.md5

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Following Handbook instructions for install from inside a Knoppix v3.9 live
CD boot.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
See Details.

Expected Results:  
See Details.

Is this a Knoppix-only thing?

$ md5sum -c stage1-x86-2005.0.tar.bz2.md5
stage1-x86-2005.0.tar.bz2: OK
$ md5sum -cv stage1-x86-2005.0.tar.bz2.md5
md5sum: invalid option -- v

i wonder if knoppix uses older md5sum release because the coreutils-5.2.1 (which
is what Gentoo uses) has the behavior described by Marcelo

The handbook expects you booted a Gentoo installCD.
Might be worth yet another knoppix-related change in the alternative install
guide. If anyone feels like it...

(In reply to comment #2)
I checked the version of the coreutils and it seems to be the same version. I 
just wish I knew more about the ins-and-outs to give everybody more useful 
information. I do, however, agree with Xavier. I should just stick with the 
guide so I don't get unexpected results.
