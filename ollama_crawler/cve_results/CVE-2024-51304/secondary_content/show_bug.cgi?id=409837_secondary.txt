If I enter bugs.gentoo.org the search field should get the focus automatically so that I just can type my query.
As a reference, look e.g. at sites like dict.leo.org.
It may also be a upstream issue as bugzilla.mozilla.org doesn't offer this handy feature.

Reproducible: Always

The search field in the navigation bar gets the focus if you have enabled JavaScript.

>  document.getElementById('quicksearch_top').focus();

You're right, it's not a bugzilla issue (unless the javascript code is not standard compliant).
in firefox it works as expected but not in rekonq nor opera :(
