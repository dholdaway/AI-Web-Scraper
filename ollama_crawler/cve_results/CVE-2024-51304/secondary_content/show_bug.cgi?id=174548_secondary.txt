Description


jieryn





          2007-04-14 04:09:40 UTC
        

I am adding some ebuilds for my company which make use of LINGUAS and IUSE="linguas_xx_YY". Repoman is complaining because many of the linguas supported by my internal use packages are not found in the linguas.desc. Please update the linguas.desc to include:

cs_CZ - Czech locale for Czechlosovakia
de_DE - German locale for Germany
fr_FR - French locale for France
hu_HU - Hungarian locale for Hungary
it_IT - Italian locale for Italy
ja_JP - Japanese locale for Japan
ko_KR - Korean locale for Korea
pl_PL - Polish locale for Poland
ru_RU - Russian locale for Russia

All of these appear redundant to me, but are also found in glibc-2.5* which gives, to me at least, some credability. Thanks in advance!

Reproducible: Always

Only LINGUAS used in the official tree are included in $PORTDIR/profiles/desc/linguas.desc. 

> cs_CZ - Czech locale for Czechlosovakia

It was Czechoslovakia, the state doesn't exist any more and there never was any Czechoslovakian language; cs_CZ means Czech. sk_SK means Slovak. ;)

Anyway, linguas.desc contains ISO-639-1 language codes, see [1] - so the above is not a valid usage of LINGUAS. All the LINGUAS you need are already there.
