Description

The use of webapp-config is forced upon users who want to install the portage versions of applications like squirrelmail.  Users should be able to install these web applications anywhere they want using webapp-config.

Not everyone maintains /var/some.domain.com structures, and not everyone likes to put all web apps under htdocs.  Therefore, webapp-config should probably have a flag like --absolute-directory to allow users to simply install the application at will wherever he/she wants.  Currently, it doesn't appear to work with directories outside of htdocs, and when instructed to install outside of htdocs, it just installs files in the base of the hostname folder.

It would also be nice if users were not forced to use webapp-config.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge squirrelmail
2. webapp-config -I -h localhost -d /var/www/localhost/somedir
3. webapp-config appears to install the files to /var/www/localhost (not ./somedir where it should be)

See /etc/vhosts/webapp-config

Here's a fix I found:

change /etc/vhosts/webapp-config:

vhost_htdocs_insecure="/"

("" is illegal, documentation should indicate this)

then use -d somedir

(this is relative to the htdocs dir, so even though the man page says /databases/blah, it doesn't mean that the directory is absolute, using -d /var/www/localhost/somedir, webapp-config would install it to the actual directory: /var/www/localhost/htdocs/var/www/localhost/somedir)


Perhaps some of this could just be clarified a bit in the docs?
