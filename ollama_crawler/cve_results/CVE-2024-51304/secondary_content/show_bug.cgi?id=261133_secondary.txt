Description

games-sports/xmoto-0.5.0-r1 crashes with a SIGILL when trying to play a game.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start xmoto
2. Click "Quick Start"

Actual Results:  
Program received signal SIGILL, Illegal instruction.
[Switching to Thread 0x7ff803a93710 (LWP 22924)]    
0x00007ff801c39874 in sqlite3VXPrintf (pAccum=0x7fff0bc587e0, useExtended=0, fmt=0x7ff801c62115 "g", ap=0x7fff0bc58810) at ./src/printf.c:163


Expected Results:  
Nice games of motorcross

From the backtrace I suspect the problem actually lies within sqlite, but I did not want to speculate on that and therefore I reported the bug on xmoto.

Sqlite version: dev-db/sqlite-3.6.11.

Is this still a problem?  That version of sqlite is no longer in portage.
