Description

I recently upgraded to cups-1.2.12-r2 and ghostscript-gpl-8.60-r1 and since then duplex printing does not work any more. I tried downgrading to ghostscript-gpl-8.54, but the error persists. All printouts are single-sided, no matter which duplex-option i provide. BTW, I use a modified version of a generic PCL5c device, using ghostscript driver ljet4d.
I set LogLevel to debug to check command line options, and they are correct.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. print any document with multiple pages

Actual Results:  
no duplex pages

Expected Results:  
pages printed on both sides

I tried a PS-capable printer, and here duplex printing is OK, must be cups in combination with ghostscript ?

Which version of cups and ghostscript did you use before?
Also what hardware are you using?

I tried to reproduce this on a HP LaserJet 5100dtn with both 
- cups 1.2, using the "HP LaserJet Series PCL 4/5 CUPS v1.2" driver
- cups 1.3, using the "HP LaserJet Series PCL 4/5, 1.3" driver
then setting 
- Duplexer: Installed
- Double-Sided Printing: Long-Edge (Standard)
in the cups webinterface and was able to print doublesided, tested with a simple OOo Writer two page document.

Can you also do a test with the same standard cups driver(s)?

I used to have cups1.2.12-r1 and ghostscript-8.54. I'm having a Canon IR 3380 (unfortunately without postscript module)

I can try one of the HP drivers next time I'm in the office, but as printing worked like a charm before the upgrade, I don't think this will help.

Did you try the official one provided by Canon yet or is this not an option for you?
I just tested with the PPD they offer on their site for the IR 3380 by downloading g7b1dex.tgz and using the cnrc288g1.ppd included in the package to configure a new cups printer and it also works with our HP printer single/duplex. However I'm not sure now if this driver uses PCL or postscript but could be worth a try.

The latest  HP's we used to have, had the postscript option installed, but

Yes. Used "HP LaserJet Series PCL 4/5 CUPS v1.2" (since the Canon iR 3380 talks PCL5c I think) and printing works like a charm after enabling the duplexer unit.
Strange, why duplex feature vanished for gs with driver ljet4d, even though the right options are set. I read something in the change logs of cups like removing duplex for single pages, maybe this has an unwanted side-effect.
Nevertheless, printing is working correctly now, and I'm happy now. Thanks for your suggestions.
Gerhard
