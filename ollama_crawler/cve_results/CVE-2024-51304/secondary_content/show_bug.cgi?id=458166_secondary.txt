Often but not regularly opening new tab in chromium crashes X (happens every time I start chromium but not every time I open new tab). I didn't notice any problems with other applications.

Reproducible: Always

I think you had the wrong version in the summary.

FWIW, I have not seen any problem like this on my own system.

Generally no application should be able to crash X11, so the crash is definitely an X11 bug.

Now Chromium may also be doing something weird, but let's see if X11 maintainers have something to say.

Try upgrading pixman to 0.29.2. (You may need to rebuild xf86-video-intel afterwards.) If that doesn't help, http://wiki.x.org/wiki/Development/Documentation/ServerDebugging explains how to get a proper backtrace from the X server.

Also consider reporting a bug upstream at https://bugs.freedesktop.org/

Please re-open after attaching requested info (e.g. stack traces) - should be easy since you have reliable repro.

Note linked issue with nouveau drivers. Looks like intel could have the same issue - or maybe it's just pixman as chithanh@ mentioned.

Either way, it's probably better to keep this open.

The backtrace from attachment 339288 [details] does not contain any indication that the issue is mesa related.

Joachim, any news here? A symbolized stack trace or test with newer pixman would be very helpful.

I think I'm using newest pixman (emerge --info pixman attached). I'll give X backtrace tommorow.

I had problems generating backtrace(and now I can't access the machine for some time)I'll provide it in a week.

After my last comment I ran

    emerge -uND

it's been almost a month since then and the problem didn't happen. I guess one of the updates fixed the problem.
