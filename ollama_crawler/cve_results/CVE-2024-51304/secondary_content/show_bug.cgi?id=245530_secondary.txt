Description

I've removed kerberos from targets/desktop/make.defaults as such the reasons for it being in there need to be addressed. As pointed out by nightmorph on the ML, it was added for gnome-extra/evolution-data-server for the LiveCDs. Gnome and Release Engineering please decide if you want to add it to IUSE defaults for that ebuild.

Releng only cares as far as packages building with the default USE. It only mattered to us in the first place because some package (probably evolution) failed to build complaining about some other package (probably evolution-data-server) not being built with some USE that it needed.

So if no one cares then this can be closed.

I believe I pointed that one out (too). We (at least I) are not interested in USE defaulting kerberos for evolution-data-server and evolution, because the amount of users of evolution-exchange is small compared to evolution and especially evolution-data-server (GNOME desktop without evolution needs it too).

I don't believe the GNOME team is interested in IUSE defaulting it for the above given reason.

It still complains, and with USE=kerberose removed from desktop profile will fail in the middle of the build on the built_with_use check.
