Description


Albert Zeyer





          2008-05-26 13:56:52 UTC
        

The WM_STATE_DEMANDS_ATTENTION is set for applications which want to notify the user about an update, for example Pidgin does set it when a new message arrive.

The gnome-panel flashes the task a few time in the panel in such a case and leaves it with blue background after. This is not redrawn though, if something is moved over it and gnome-panel redraws this part after, it's normal again (but only the redrawn part, the other part is still blue).

Happens for me often and looks always a bit strange and wrong.

Look at "Buddy-Liste" in the panel.

(Btw., I mixed it up, it's not blue but gray.)

hum, we probably need more infos about the theme and engine you are using.
One strange thing is that you're not supposed to be able to put something over the panels so the application or the WM you are using is probably buggy for not respecting the  WM hints anyway.

I am using Metacity with default settings.

To reproduce the bug, I tried to get a tooltip over the part (and a tooltip message window is (and should be) over the panel).

How much CPU and memory are being consumed when you are able to reproduce it? I can only reproduce when, for example, some swap is being used and a lot of CPU is being consumed

The procedure I described to reproduce the bug works always. In general, you have to try to get a window (for example a tooltip) over the greyed task. I think it only works when it has already stopped flashing because while flashing, it redraws always the whole thing.

However, the bug also occurs in other situations, for example when some new tasks occurs in the list and the system is lagging a lot because of huge load. I saw the bug firstly in such a situation and then tried to reproduce it later.

I think the bug is more or less clear: Gnome-Panel redraws the part of the task in the panel when it has to redraw it (when another window was over this part) but just draws it with default color. It does not remember at this point that the tasks should be drawn in dark grey.

How can I get it stop flashing? I always get it flashing, then, I can only reproduce when my system is under heavy load Thanks for info :-)

I don't know if it is always like this, but in most (all?) situations, the tasks flashes for a while (some seconds) and then keeps staying dark gray.

I have just tried and, even waiting for flash to stop, I am not able to reproduce :-/ (I have tried with Clearlooks and Industrial), Have you tried with a new created user account?

I used to see this bug sometimes, but it has indeed been a while since I've actually seen it. Let's just assume this bug is fixed :)

Please don't hesitate to reopen this bug if you can still reproduce with newer versions of gnome-panel.

Thanks
