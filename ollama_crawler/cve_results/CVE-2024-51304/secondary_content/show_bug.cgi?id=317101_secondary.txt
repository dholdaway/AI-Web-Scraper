Description


Juergen Rose





          2010-04-25 10:52:23 UTC
        

Sending local mails fails with:
root@condor:/root(83)# mail root@localhost

Subject: test
test
Cc: 
mail: /usr/sbin/sendmail: No such file or directory
Can't send mail: sendmail process failed with error code 1

There is really no /usr/sbin/sendmail but /usr/sbin/sendmail.sendmail:
root@condor:/root(88)# ll /usr/sbin/sendmail*         
-r-xr-s--x 1 root smmsp 716024 Jan  5 23:02 /usr/sbin/sendmail.sendmail*

And sendmail.sendmail is configured as sendmail program /etc/mail/mailer.conf:
root@condor:/root(85)# grep "^sendmail" /etc/mail/mailer.conf 
sendmail        /usr/sbin/sendmail.sendmail

Sendmail is running:
root@condor:/root(84)# /etc/init.d/sendmail status
 * status: started
root@condor:/root(87)# ps -ef | grep sendmail
root     10096 23822  0 12:47 pts/2    00:00:00 grep --colour=auto sendmail
root     19319     1  0 10:29 ?        00:00:00 sendmail: accepting connections                
smmsp    19322     1  0 10:29 ?        00:00:00 sendmail: Queue runner@00:30:00 for /var/spool/clientmqueue

Why mail want to use /usr/sbin/sendmail and not /usr/sbin/sendmail.sendmail?

Reproducible: Always

I guess that's a runtime configuration issue, then? If you have suggestions on how to improve how we inform users about that, please reopen.
