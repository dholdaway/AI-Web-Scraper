The kwallet migrationagent starts when booting up my system. However the old kde4 wallets are not migrated. In my logs I find the following information.

kwalletd5[9903]: Migration agent starting...
kwalletd5[9903]: Migration wizard returned an error or has been canceled. The migration agent will resume upon next daemon start
kwalletd5[9903]: Migration agent stop.

Not very useful to me.
I didn't mistype the password, as that gives an error on the screen.
Any idea what could be wrong?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start kde
2.type password of old wallet when requested
3.

Which version of kde-frameworks/kwallet is installed?

5.21.0 (latest stable in portage)

This sounds like the upstream bug in $URL and should fixed in 5.23 (our next stable candidate).

By now upgraded to 5.23.0.

Now have this in my logs:
kwalletd5[1051]: Migration agent starting...
kwalletd5[1051]: Migration failed.
kwalletd5[1051]: Migration wizard returned an error or has been canceled. The migration agent will resume upon next daemon start
kwalletd5[1051]: Migration agent stop.

Seems the next stable candidate doesn't solve the issue.

Can you confirm that the old kwalletd (kde-apps/kwalletd) is available and running during the migration?

I can confirm that the old kwalletd did run during the migration.
I can not reproduce it anymore as I decided to open both wallets (old and new) and manually copy over the data to the new wallet.

Thanks, closing then.
