Please add ~amd64 tag to p7zip-4.39.

p7zip-4.39 builds cleaner than current stable for amd64 (4.20), and it is stable for x86 and ppc.  It works fine for me, and would probably be a good candidate for the next stable amd64 version.

Not sure why it wasn't already marked - might have been bug 135417

emerge.info to be attached.

Why don't you use 4.42 which is already keyworded?

Because I was hoping it would be marked stable, eventually.  The current stable (p7zip) is broken for gcc 4.1.1, but not for this version.  Other packages have it marked stable, so unless there are amd issues (and it appears there are not), then it could be quickly marked stable.  This way, a gcc 4.1.x issue gets taken care as well.

I suppose I should have been bold and asked for stable amd64, since I'm not sure who would test this over 4.42

I guess I'm supposed to reopen the bug, since I provided the info...

Well, we'll stabilize 4.42 when Bug 137579 is fixed. Doesn't make sense to ~arch keyword an older ebuild, wouldn't make stabilization on amd64 faster anyway.
