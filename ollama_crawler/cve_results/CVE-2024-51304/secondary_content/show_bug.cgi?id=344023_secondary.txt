The package dev-php/pear-1.9.1 doesn't work with the new slotted php dev-lang/php-5.3.3-r3. The pear or pecl command cannot find the correct php executable.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge pear
2. eselect php set cli php5.3
3. pear

Actual Results:  
Sorry for the German translation.

/usr/bin/pear: Zeile 28: /usr/lib/php5/bin/php: Datei oder Verzeichnis nicht gefunden
/usr/bin/pear: Zeile 28: exec: /usr/lib/php5/bin/php: Kann nicht ausführen: Datei oder Verzeichnis nicht gefunden

Expected Results:  
Show the pear commands

Please make sure that you have upgraded PEAR-PEAR to version 1.9.1-r3. It should work then.

Please reopen/comment if upgrading to PEAR-PEAR-1.9.1-r3 doesn't work for you.

I've made a mental note to mention that in the docs.
