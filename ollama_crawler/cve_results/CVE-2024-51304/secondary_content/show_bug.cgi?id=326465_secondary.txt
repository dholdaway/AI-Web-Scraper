At most of the time when I login into GNOME gsd(gnome-settings-daemon) does not run. This disables some of the appearance properties being applied to the GNOME session. With the gsd not running no wallpaper is displayed at all nor the icons.
When trying to launch gnome-appearance-properties the gnome-session would crash with X.

Does this still occur on a new created user account?

Actually I have another account on the same machine and the problem doesn't occour, I haven't thought about that, thanks Pacho. Do you know which .file is responsible for that?

Sadly, it's usually difficult to investigate what old configuration cause problems like this. I suggest you to to check ~/.xsession-errors file just after getting the failure as it could contain some interesting information. 

You can also try to copy configuration directories from your broken account to the new one trying to find offending one (directories like .gconf, .gnome2, .nautilus...)

This bug has to be closed then, feel free to reopen if you are able to reproduce on a new created user account following some steps (that gnome tools allow to follow, I mean, not simply copying offending file created by some old tool to account working properly). You can also try to find help at forums.gentoo.org

Good luck!
