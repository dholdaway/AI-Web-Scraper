The lang-smalltalk test relies on behaviour of gnu-smalltalk which seems to have changed between 2.1 and 2.2, namely that the -Q (--no-messages) option does /not/ suppress the "Loading package" message when loading a package.

Created attachment 130836 [details, diff]
gettext-0.16-smalltalk-tests.patch

Since gnu-smalltalk-2.1.12 is still in the tree, the patch increases the requirement to versions with the new behaviour (otherwise the test is skipped).

This is fixed in 0.17, so I'll assume we don't care about older versions.
