Created attachment 688551 [details]
build.log.xz

build log and emerge --info (compressed because it exceeds attachment limit, use 'xzless' to read it)

Unfortunately, I am completely unable to reproduce this, I *think* the problem is here:

project-config.jam:10: syntax error at keyword in
Performing configuration checks

My *guess* is that it is generating a bad configuration somehow, which is triggering boost to try to install to /usr/local. I am not sure what could be causing it to generate a bad configuration.

Are there any sort of special environment variables set on these hosts that the build system might be detecting and changing it's behaviour from?

Would it be possible to get a copy of 
/var/tmp/portage/sys-cluster/ceph-15.2.9/work/ceph-15.2.9/src/boost/project-config.jam
