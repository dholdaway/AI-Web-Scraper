Dispatch-conf, merge mode, russian help translation. 'l' and 'r' command descriptions are the same!

Reproducible: Always

We don't have any russian translations, so I guess it's some third party tool (Zac mentioned sdiff) you're talking about.

I sounds like some issue with the merge program.  See '/etc/dispatch-conf.conf'.

Sorry for wrong bug placement. It is really third party tool 'sdiff' and incorrect translation located in diffutils.mo.  Will try to submit bugreport to upstream.
