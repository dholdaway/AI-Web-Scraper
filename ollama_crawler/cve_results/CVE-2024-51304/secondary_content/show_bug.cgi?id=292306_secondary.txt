lxml-2.2.3 has the same problem.

Confirmed dev-python/lxml-2.2.2 depends on >=dev-python/setuptools-0.6_rc5 and the versioning of the setuptools ebuilds now follows the Major.Minor.Revision pattern.

If we edit the ebuild and change the DEPEND line to ">=dev-python/setuptools-0.6.5" it works ok (note: setuptools 0.6.5 is masked).

Here I've attached a small patch for the ebuild to work.

Patch for the ebuild.

It's obviously wrong.

Can you reproduce this bug with a different version of dev-python/setuptools?

If you unmask setuptools it builds fine.

OK. I'm closing this bug.
