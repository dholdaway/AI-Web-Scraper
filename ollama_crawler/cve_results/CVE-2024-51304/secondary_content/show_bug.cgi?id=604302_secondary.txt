Unfortunately, this is going to be somewhat a problem for awhile until everyone gets transitioned from the old split twisted packaging to the new single pkg twisted.

I would encourage you to open bugs for any pkgs you have installed that only depend on the older split twisted pkg.  It seems pkg maintainers have been slow to add the new twisted dep to the pkgs they maintain.  

If you prefer the new twisted even for those pkgs. You will have to add package.provided entries for the various split twisted-* pkgs that your system has installed.

I was thinking of starting a tracking bug listing all pkgs that need their twisted deps updated, but I have been busy, plus I am already several versions behind for the new twisted version bumps due to changes and test failures.

Portage no longer complains about the conflict, closing.
