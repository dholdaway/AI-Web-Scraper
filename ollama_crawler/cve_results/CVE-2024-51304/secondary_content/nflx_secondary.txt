Exhibit 99.1 January 23, 2024Fellow shareholders,Summary:•We’ve just ended our first year with Ted and Greg as co-CEOs and, under their leadership, Netflix achieved the key financial objectives we set at the start of 2023. We’ve: ◦Accelerated our growth, exiting the year with 12% revenue growth, up from 6% in 2022; ◦Grown our FY23 operating margin to 21% from 18% in 2022, ahead of our 20% target;  ◦Increased our free cash flow to $6.9B for 2023. •The year has shown the need for Netflix to balance consistency and continuous improvement with adaptability. In 2024, we see big opportunities to: ◦Increase our value to members by further improving the core (series and film), while broadening our offering (games, live and sports-adjacent programming); ◦Tap into a significant new long term revenue and profit pool by scaling our ads business; ◦Deepen our connection with fans through our marketing, consumer products and innovative new live experiences.  •We believe there is plenty of room for growth ahead as streaming expands, and our north star remains the same: to thrill members with our entertainment. If we can continue to improve Netflix faster than the competition, we’ll have an increasingly valuable business – for consumers, creators and shareholders.Our summary results, and forecast for Q1, are below.

 Inside Netflix Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
However, these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately $1 billion to $4 billion over the next three years, with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months.



 Other - Other   Highlight
Actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
The increase in cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 was due to a $171 million increase in content amortization relating to our existing and new content, coupled with a $376 million increase in other cost of revenues primarily due to an increase in expenses directly associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of content.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
We do not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes.

 Other - Other   Highlight
The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments.
