 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASECompany ContactInvestors: Jim Zeumer(404) 978-6434     Email: jim.zeumer@pultegroup.comPULTEGROUP REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS•Net Income of $3.28 Per Share •Net New Orders Increased 57% to 6,214 Homes•Closings of 7,615 Homes Drove Home Sale Revenues of $4.2 Billion•Home Sale Gross Margin of 28.9%•Unit Backlog of 12,146 Homes with a Value of $7.3 Billion•Repurchased 3.6 Million Common Shares in the Quarter for $300 Million•Year End Cash Balance of $1.8 Billion and a Debt-to-Capital Ratio of 15.9%•Announces $1.5 Billion Increase to Share Repurchase Authorization ATLANTA – January 30, 2024 - PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE: PHM) announced today financial results for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023. For the quarter, the Company reported net income of $711 million, or $3.28 per share, compared to prior year reported net income of $882 million, or $3.85 per share. “PulteGroup’s strong fourth quarter financial results complete a record setting year, while the 57% increase in net new orders provides tremendous momentum heading into 2024,” said Ryan Marshall, PulteGroup President and CEO. “For the full year, PulteGroup generated nearly $16 billion in revenues and net income of $2.6 billion, while delivering a return on equity* of 27.0% and returning over $1.1 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends.“As the fourth quarter progressed, we experienced a significant increase in buyer activity as interest rates moved lower, resulting in December being the highest sales month of the quarter.  With expectations for interest rates to remain lower in 2024, we are optimistic that improved affordability dynamics will continue attracting buyers into the market.“After multiple years of variable macroeconomic activity, expectations are that 2024 can be a year of increased homebuying demand given a strong job market, lower interest rates and a limited inventory of existing homes. With a ready supply of homes and lots, I believe PulteGroup is extremely well positioned to capitalize on such market conditions as we seek to grow our business, while delivering strong cash flow and high returns.”Fourth Quarter ResultsFor the fourth quarter, home sale revenues totaled $4.2 billion, compared with $5.0 billion in the prior year. Revenues in the quarter reflect closings of 7,615 homes at an average sales price of $547,000. Closings in the fourth quarter of 2022 totaled 8,848 homes at an average sales price of $561,000. 1The following information was filed by Pultegroup Inc (PHM) on Tuesday, January 30, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.

 Inside Pultegroup Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
However, production cycle times remain elevated versus our historical norms as the availability of certain materials and construction labor remain challenged along with ongoing, though lessened, delays in municipal approvals and inspections.



 Other - Other   Highlight
However, in the event of an extended economic slowdown that leads to moderate or significant decreases in the price of new homes in certain geographic or buyer submarkets, we could have a larger number of communities that begin to approach these levels such that more detailed impairment analyses would be necessary, and the resulting impairments could be material.

 Other - Other   Highlight
The demand for new homes declined beginning in mid-2022 as the Federal Reserve repeatedly increased benchmark interest rates in response to inflation, which, in turn, drove national mortgage and other interest rates higher and negatively impacted home affordability and consumer sentiment.

 Financial - Debt   Highlight
If a court were to find that the incurrence of a guarantee was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, the court could void the payment obligations under that guarantee, could subordinate that guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of the Guarantor or could require the holders of the senior notes to repay any amounts received with respect to that guarantee.

 Legal - Other   Highlight
Changes in the frequency and timing of reported claims and estimates of specific claim values can impact the underlying inputs and trends utilized in the actuarial analyses, which could have a material impact on the recorded reserves.
