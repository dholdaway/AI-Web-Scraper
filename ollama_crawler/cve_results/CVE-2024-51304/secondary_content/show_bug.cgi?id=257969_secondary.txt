Description

crossdev adds/changes lines in /etc/portage/package.use.  It is my understanding (and my strong preference) that ebuilds shouldn't mess with /etc/portage/package.* files directly, since the purpose of those files is *human* specification of per-package options.  Surely there is a more proper way to specify the options that crossdev wants when emerging components (such as USE=blah emerge foo).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. crossdev -t avr --without-headers

Actual Results:  
Lines appear in /etc/portage/package.use:

cross-2.18-r3/binutils -selinux
cross-avr/avr-libc -selinux
cross-avr/binutils -selinux
cross-avr/gcc -boundschecking -d -fortran -gtk -gcj -libffi -mudflap -objc -objc++ -objc-gc -openmp -selinux -boundschecking -d -fortran -gtk -gcj -libffi -mudflap -objc -objc++ -objc-gc -openmp nocxx

Expected Results:  
No changes to /etc/portage/package.* files is expected.

That is not the case. The crossdev ebuild installs a script which you then use as root to alter some configuration files that affect sys-apps/portage.

You're looking for a --pretend option, I guess.

crossdev isnt an ebuild and so gets to tamper all it likes

the changes are a lot more sane if you use a dir and use sep files in /etc/portage/package.use/ ...
