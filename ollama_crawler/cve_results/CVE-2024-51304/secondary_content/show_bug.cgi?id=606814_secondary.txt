Interesting!  I wonder what way I could have find that package myself.

I think it would be cool to help users find that new package (and to ease upgrading LaTeX to 2016 as a result).  How about

 * a hollow dev-texlive/texlive-mathextra-2006
   depending on dev-texlive/texlive-mathscience-2016 or

 * a portage news item?

What do you think?

it is pulled by app-text/texlive[science]

we wont be adding transitionary packages or do a news item every time there is a package renaming / merge in texlive; 2016 was low with only one, usually it is more like 3 or 4

One Tex news item per year iteration seems totally worth keeping many LaTeX users out of upgrading frustration.  My update to LaTex 2016 was no fun at all, to say the least and, as you can see, I did not find that replacement package.
Please consider a news item for the 2017 round next time.  I'll join you writing it, if you want.

The point of the app-text/texlive ebuild is to have people set useflags there for what they want and have portage do the rest. Putting dev-texlive/* packages in world will almost surely cause frustration at some point.

If there is anything that can be improved on app-text/texlive, please share it!

It is painful because the upgrade path is utterly broken and requires too many !! blockers sadly.

Per the above, portage should find it for you :)
