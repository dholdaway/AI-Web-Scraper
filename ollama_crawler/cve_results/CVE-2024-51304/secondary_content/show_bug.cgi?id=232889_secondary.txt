Description

gpsd provides a generic TCP server for reading out GPS data from devices.
According to the documentation and the developers in IRC there are among other two command line options:
-N Output logs to stdout instead of syslog
-b prevent a firmwarebug for Holux devices that can freez them

The first one is not so important, but -b is pretty critical for users with Holux devices (cheap things <.<). The firmware can in certain cases 'freeze' and since there is an built-in battery, the GPS Mouse is technically dead unless you physically open it to remove the battery and shorten the memory.

The Gentoo ebuilds
gpsd-2.34, 2.36 and 2.37
all state that they do not know the -N or -b option.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. run 'gpsd -b' pr 'gpsd -N'

Actual Results:  
"gpsd: invalid option -- b"

Expected Results:  
No error

Oh, resetting the device by just turning it on/off (maybe twice) also works. So it does not brick my GPS mouse... which makes it less problematic =)

Are you sure you have the right version of gpsd?  The older gpsdrive used to provide an old fork of gpsd, so please make sure which versions of what that you have installed or are invoking from the command line.

The current ~gpsd-2.38 has the following commandline options:

usage: gpsd [-b] [-n] [-N] [-D n] [-F sockfile] [-P pidfile] [-S port] [-h] device...
  Options include: 
  -b                        = bluetooth-safe: open data sources read-only
  -n                        = don't wait for client connects to poll GPS
  -N                        = don't go into background
  -F sockfile               = specify control socket location
  -P pidfile                = set file to record process ID 
  -D integer (default 0)    = set debug level 
  -S integer (default 2947) = set port for daemon 
  -h                        = help message 
  -V                        = emit version and exit.
