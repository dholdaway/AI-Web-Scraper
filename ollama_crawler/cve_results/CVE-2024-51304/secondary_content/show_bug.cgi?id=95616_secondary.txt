Description

I had a kde 3.4.0 installation and i emerged the 3.4.1, first kdelibs, then  
other parts. i also unmerged some kde 3.3 packages that had been lefover when  
upgrading to 3.4.0.  
After doing this kde failed to retrieve mails saying it could not start the  
pop3 process.   
I tried manually compiling kdepim from the distfiles directory with no  
improvement, reinstaling kdelibs 3.4.0 didnt work either, I also tried with 
and without zeroconf use variable (that is the only use variable that had 
changed from the 3.4 to 3.4.1 installations  
Problem was solved after installing with  konstruct making it download source 
directly from kde, i used default konstruct configuration except for the 
prefix which i set to the /usr/kde/3.4 dir 
this makes me think it is an ebuild problem. 

Reproducible: Didn't try
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
2.
3.



Expected Results:  
portage should install a kde 3.4.1 that works as well as if compiling with 
kde.org source  

Dont know if might be related, probably not by I mention it, neither the 3.4.1 
or the previous 3.4.0 kde installations where able to show devices in 
konqueror (protocol not supported), however this still doesnt work after using 
kompare, but kompare didnt quite finish installing kde because of disk 
problems , but the part it installed fixed kmail problem

Probably there was some problem with kio_pop3, which comes from the kdebase 
package. Unfortunately, since we cannot reproduce it, nobody else reported it 
and you overwrote your kde installation with something else, there's no way to 
say what it was. 
 
Please reopen if you find a way to reproduce it. 
 
btw: the devices problem is unrelated: see bug 81522.
