emerge compresses the file /usr/share/info/dir to dir.gz.

the info mode of emacs requires the uncompressed dir file to display the info files in /usr/share/info

(at least on my machine)

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. emacs M+x info (doesn't work)
2. gzcat /usr/share/info/dir.gz >/usr/share/info/dir
3. emacs M+x info (works)
4. emerge -u world
5. = 1.



Expected Results:  
emerge shouldn't compress the dir file

Is this an emacs bug or should portage not be doing this?

Emacs (and probably XEmacs and SXEmacs) doesn't support dir.gz.

well, no package should install /usr/share/info/dir{,.gz} which means this is
portage territory

which portage version do you encounter this problem with? I can't reproduce it with 2.1 and the code doesn't look like it would gzip the dir file.
