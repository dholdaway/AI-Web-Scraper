 Inside Mongodb, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 M & A - Other   Highlight
In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date.



 Other - Other   Highlight
Adverse macroeconomic conditions include slower or negative economic growth, higher inflation and higher interest rates.

 Other - Other   Highlight
The annual limitation, should we undergo an ownership change, may result in the expiration of U.S. federal or state net operating losses and credits before utilization; however we do not expect any such limitation to be material.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, sales commission and benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
The increase in sales and marketing expense included $55.9 million from higher personnel costs and stock-based compensation, driven by an increase in our sales and marketing headcount to 2,338 as of January 31, 2024 from 2,249 as of January 31, 2023, which includes non-quota-carrying hires in sales operations, customer success and marketing.
