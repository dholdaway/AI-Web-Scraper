Description

After updating Firefox from 2.0.0.16 to the current 2.0.0.17 yesterday I can't use the passwords stored in Firefox anymore. Also I can't seem to save new passwords. 
After going back to 2.0.0.16 the passwords are back again, updating again to 2.0.0.17 and passwords are gone again.
The behaviour sounds identical to a problem reported with Firefox 3.0.2 that was fixed with 3.0.3 (http://support.mozilla.com/de/kb/cannot+use+or+save+passwords+after+upgrading+Firefox). 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.update Firefox from 2.0.0.16 to 2.0.0.17
2.start Firefox
3.go to Security/Show passwords

Actual Results:  
An empty list is shown. 

Expected Results:  
With 2.0.0.16 Firefox asks for my master password and thenm shows a list of web sites and usernames.

Not sure if this is a linux or gentoo only problem. I was using Firefox 2.0.0.16 on a windows machine and updated it to 2.0.0.17 without problems, all passwords were still there.

Yeah, i had the same issue with thunderbird...

Are we talking about -bin or not bin?

Sorry for not mentioning this. No -bin, I'm compiling from sources (www-client/mozilla-firefox-2.0.0.17).

From https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=451155#c17 : 
> relnote: passwords entries of this type created in the broken builds (3.0,

You should try to check the charset of the file signons.txt in your firefox profile (don't forget to make a backup).

See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=454708 comments #25 and #26 for details.

Thanks for the links, however

- I don't have notepad.exe on my machine and probably never will ;-)

- when I open signons2.txt in kwrite and check for the coding it already says UTF8. Saving it again doesn't change a single bit.

I updated to 2.0.0.17 again, removed signons2.txt completely and restarted Firefox. I was able to save passwords, but signons2.txt wasn't created and after restarting Firefox the previously entered password wasn't remembered.

So it seems mmy problem is not related to signons2.txt only :-(.

I now removed my profile completely and started from scratch. Password saving works again, although it still doesn't read my old signons2.txt. Seems I lost them completely :-((.

I will now try to rebuild my configuration (setup, addons, bookmarks, etc.) and then see which passwords I can remember/restore...

You should try to save signons2.txt in iso-8859-1 and then go back to UTF8.

As I said before even Firefox 2.0.0.17 didn't save any passwords when starting it with _no_ signons2.txt.

So I reinstalled 2.0.0.16, made screenshots of all sites, usernames and passwords, removed my profile and updated to 2.0.0.17.

I'm now going to visit all sites, log on and save the passwords.
