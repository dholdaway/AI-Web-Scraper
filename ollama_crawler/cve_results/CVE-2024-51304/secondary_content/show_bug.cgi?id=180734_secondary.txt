When I emerged thunderbird-bin, I was unable to start it because of a missing libstdc++.so.5.  I checked that I had it and emerged libstdc++-v3 (the compatability version) and it worked.  This library should be made a dependency of thunderbird-bin.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Emerge thunderbird-bin
2.Run thunderbrid-bin at command line.
3.Emerge libstdc++-v3
4.Run thunderbird-bin again.

Actual Results:  
I was able to run thunderbird-bin after the emerge of libstdc++-v3.

Except that it already depends on virtual/libstdc++ on x86 and emul-linux-x86-compat on amd64.
