The none of the mirrors for this the "et-linux-2.60.x86.run" file currently resolve. I found a FreeBSD.org link that worked:

ftp://ftp13.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/distfiles/et-linux-2.60.x86.run

It emerges, so I assume the checksum for this file matched.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge games-fps/enemy-territory

I tried a few online ping tools and even a few anonymous proxies

http://just-ping.com/index.php?vh=ftp.planetmirror.com&c=&s=ping!
http://network-tools.com/default.asp?prog=ping&host=ftp.planetmirror.com

http://anonymouse.org/cgi-bin/anon-www.cgi/http://ftp.planetmirror.com
http://proxify.com/p/011110A0000110/http:=2f=2fftp.planetmirror.com=2f

None of them work, so it's not just me.

Yes, it's just you.  Keep trying.  It continues to work fine for various mirrors for me.

ftp.planetmirror.com still doesn't work for me but it did finally start resolving ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com. I tried a dozen times today and it suddenly started working. I wonder if it stopped using the mirror://3dgamers/ SRC_URI and jumped down to the next option which now does work.

I don't like the WORKSFORME resolution btw, as it was premature since it definitely did not work for me earlier.
