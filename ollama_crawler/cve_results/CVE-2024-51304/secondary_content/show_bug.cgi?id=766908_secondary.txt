From the eclass documentation you get an impression that 
  LUA_REQ_USE="deprecated(+)"

would always be used, but this doesn't seem to be the case.
  emerge: there are no ebuilds built with USE flags to satisfy "dev-lang/luajit:=[deprecated]".

You can get past this error by specifying 
  LUA_REQ_USE="deprecated(+)"
in your ebuild, as instructed by conikost, but I have a feeling this should work from eclass's side. It may be better fixed early before all ebuilds need local hacks.

I don't think I agree with this. The documentation says LUA_REQ_USE specifies (emphasis mine) "USE flags *required* to be enabled on the chosen Lua implementations", and defaulting to (+) would IMHO go against the above.

What you want here is lua_gen_impl_dep().

I see, there is a nice example, so I guess, we can close here?

Btbh, LUA_REQ_USE="deprecated(+)" looks somehow better for me :-)

Sure sure, it doesn't seem like anyone else is hitting this problem.
