Our fourth quarter acquisition of CoolTera and our continued commitment to supporting our customers reinforce our strong position in liquid cooling for high density compute applications driven by AI demand. With our ability to develop and deliver solutions across the entire thermal and power technology spectrum and customize at scale, our unparalleled service organization, our strong partnerships with leading industry players and our deep customer relationships, Vertiv is uniquely positioned for leadership in a strong and accelerating market.”Dave Cote, Vertiv’s Executive Chairman, added: “In his first year as CEO, Gio and his team have put Vertiv on a firm footing, achieving improved performance across all financial metrics, including profitability and strong adjusted free cash flow which supports acceleration of our long-term capital deployment framework.

 Inside Vertiv Holdings Co's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
In the event that the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from our estimates and assumptions due to changes or future events such as tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans, the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material effect on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings (Loss) and Consolidated Balance Sheets.



 Other - Other   Highlight
•Artificial Intelligence ("AI"): Increased maturity and adoption of AI and high-performance compute is currently impacting the data center industry driving technology innovation and could lead to increased demand.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
If actual results differ from our estimates made in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally impact earnings.
