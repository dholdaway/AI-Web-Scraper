Latest stable smokeping in portage is 2.2.4, latest upstream 2.2.x is 2.2.7 from 11/2007.

Please bump ebuild for people who want to stay on legacy 2.2.x

Luca I never used 2.2.x version and I don't have time to test if that ancient version works with new software. If you need that old versions, please, create ebuild, test it and attach diff to this bug. Personally I'm going to stabilize 2.4.x.
