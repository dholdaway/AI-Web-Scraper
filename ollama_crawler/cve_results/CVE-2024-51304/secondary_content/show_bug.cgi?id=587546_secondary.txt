cat /var/tmp/portage/media-video/mpv*/temp/build.log

Hello, pardon the horribly written summary.

I am trying to build mpv (0.9.2-r1 or 0.18.0 doesn't matter, both fail) and I get errors right away. This might be due to me using grsecurity with CONFIG_PAX_MPROTECT enabled as certain python errors inevitably occur with that feature enabled. Errors are in attachment.

On a side note, I suggest putting a .py file extension to waf so users don't need to open it to see what type of file it is.

emerge --info and build.log files of 0.9.2-r1, 0.17.0-r5, and 0.18.0 attached, thank you.

My assumption was right, CONFIG_PAX_MPROTECT is the culprit. Disabling it works fine.
