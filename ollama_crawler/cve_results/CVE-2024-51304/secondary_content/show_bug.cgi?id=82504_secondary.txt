Not sure about that but when libiconv and gettext are fixed in portage, irssi can be merged with the normal official ebuild (and glib2).
See bug #84683

gettext and libiconv are in main portage.
glib2 in overlay works out of the box (and i hope soon the one in portage will be enough)

irssi works fine here.
