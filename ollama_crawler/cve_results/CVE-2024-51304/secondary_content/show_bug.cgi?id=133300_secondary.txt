I have two gentoo boxes (let's call them box1 and box2). Box1 has rxvt-unicode installed, box2 does not. Now when I do this...

box1 $ ssh box2
box2 $ screen
Cannot find terminfo entry for 'rxvt-unicode'.

Umm... that's not right. IMHO the default terminfo database (or whatever screen is using) should contain entries for at least all terminals in portage.

rxvt-unicode installs its own terminfo (likewise eterm etc.), so you'd get just collisions. Use scp to copy it to the boxes where you need it.

Why not take /usr/share/terminfo/r/rxvt-unicode out of x11-terms/rxvt-unicode and put it into sys-libs/ncurses?

I personally see this as a temporary workaround, not a clean solution.  I don't think many users will know to do this.  Even if they did, things get slightly more complicated if they don't have root access on the remote box.

I personally feel that operations as simple and common as sshing to a remote box should simply work -- no futzing necessary.
