I am following the instructions for installation.

in between echo startkde > ~/.xinitrc and startx, you either need to define a path, or replace this with echo /usr/kde/<version>/bin/startkde > ~/.xinitrc .  by itself, startkde is not found by xinit.

kde should always also define /usr/kde/current/ to be a link to whatever the version is, but this is another issue altogether.

sincerely,

/iaw

hi;

thank you for your reaction..
tough i can quiet understand why 
"echo startkde > ~/.xinitrc" doens't work

this should be "echo exec startkde > ~/.xinitrc"
like we mentioned in www.gentoo.org/doc/en/kde-config.xml#doc_chap2_sect5

greetings,
diox

I know.  but I believe the directory is not part of the X path, unless you set it (not mentioned).  somewhere, there needs to be a way to find the full path, I believe.

Maybe your PATH has been broken ? You can set it on the way we do here : http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=2&chap=5#doc_chap3

CAUTION: you *should* really think about where you want your path to be!
the information about path is on the same page (at the top)

I have just tested it and in my KDE 3.5.3 it works just fine (without exec too). If there's a bug denying some versions of KDE being added to the $PATH, please file it to the KDE team to be fixed as soon as possible. 

Thanks for reporting, but it has to be closed.
