See title. I firstly compiled subversion with perl-bindings but it didn't run, complaining about missing symbols in swig. After adding perl to the useflags of dev-lang/swig and recompiling both, it worked.

Reproducible: Always

Could you post the exact error?
SWIG itself doesn't provide any symbols. It has no libraries:
$ qlist swig | grep lib
$ qlist swig | grep so
$

Hmm, you are right. I can't reproduce it. So, I'd rather change this one to "dev-util/subversion" needs two compile runs for the Perl Bindings to work (actually, it needs two successful ones and my first one wasn't. Without changing anything, it worked at the second try).
