The bugsgoactivity.php script is very useful, but the information of the very last activity (whereas activity is any sign of life) is very valuable for me, so please include that functionality :)

Thanks in advance and best regards,
Stefan


P.S. Sorry to abuse the security component for this, had no clue where to put it.
