The ebuild does not add mimelnks to the kde folder, making the "project save" function unusable. Should copy vnd.kde.kdenlive.* in /usr/kde/3.5/share/mimelnk/applications

Reproducible: Always

No, it shouldn't install mimelinks in the KDE install path. Are they installed in /usr/share/mimelnk/applications/ ?

Yes they are there indeed, but as I found out the folder is not readable by users

#ls /usr/share/mimelnk/ -ld
drwx------ 4 root root 104 2007-05-01 01:03 /usr/share/mimelnk/

Is it how it's supposed to be?

Obviously not; fix the permissions and it will work.

# ls -ld /usr/share/mimelnk/
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 80 2006-03-14 14:31 /usr/share/mimelnk/
