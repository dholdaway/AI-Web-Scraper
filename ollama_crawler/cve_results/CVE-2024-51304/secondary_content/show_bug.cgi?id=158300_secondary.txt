net-wireless/ipw3945-1.1.3 fails to compile with the following:

/var/tmp/portage/net-wireless/ipw3945-1.1.3/work/ipw3945-1.1.3/ipw3945.c:9624: error: too many arguments to function 'ieee80211_tx_frame'

I did not change anything in the kernel between ipw3945 versions. My current kernel is suspend2-sources 2.6.18 on a 100% ~x86 system.

Please let me know if I can provide any additional information.

suspend2-sources is not a supported kernel...

Either try to use >sys-kernel/suspend2-sources-2.6.18 or try to verify this with gentoo-sources / vanilla-sources.

I did not know it was an unsupported kernel. Now I do. =)

Not a bug because ipw3945 works with the newest gentoo-sources.
