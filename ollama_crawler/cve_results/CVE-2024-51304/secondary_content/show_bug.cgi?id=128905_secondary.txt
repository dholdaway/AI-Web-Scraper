Description

Starting up Kontact 3.5.2 causes a segfault when the main window comes up, after it has accessed the KDE Wallet. I emerged the KDE PIM suite using the kdepim-meta ebuild.

Backtrace:

I also expierenced this behaviour several times.
For me a temporary solution is to delete the Archive directory of akregator '~/.kde3.5/share/apps/akregator/Archive'. After that kontact starts up fine.

Regards,
Ruben

Curiously, PIM now works absolutely fine for me. Haven't changed anything manually, as far as I know. Perhaps the archive was deleted somehow.  Thanks anyway.

Alastair, a backtrace without debugging symbols is pretty useless. In future build the application which crashes and it's dependencies as needed with 

USE=debug FEATURES=nostrip 

and -fomit-frame-pointer removed from your C[XX]FLAGS



As the issue seemed to be fixed in between...
