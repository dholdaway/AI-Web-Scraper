 Inside Teleflex Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
The ultimate outcome of these examinations could result in increases or decreases to our recorded tax liabilities, which would affect our financial results.



 Other - Other   Highlight
In assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we evaluate positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events, including results of operations and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Subject to certain exceptions, we are required to maintain a maximum total net leverage ratio of 4.50 to 1.00.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
For the year ended December 31, 2023, gross margin increased 50 basis points, or 0.9%, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to price increases, benefits from cost improvement initiatives and lower logistics and distribution related costs, partially offset by continued cost inflation from macro-economic factors, specifically with respect to raw materials, and an unfavorable impact on manufacturing productivity due to constraints in raw material supply.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Although the long term impact on bariatric procedures from GLP-1 products is uncertain, to the extent GLP-1 products reduce the long term demand for bariatrics surgery procedures and cause their prevalence to differ significantly from management’s expectations, we ultimately may find it necessary to recognize future impairment charges with respect to the related assets, which could be material.
