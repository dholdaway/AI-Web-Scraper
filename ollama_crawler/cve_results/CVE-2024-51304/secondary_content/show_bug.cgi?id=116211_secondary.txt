fglrx driver - required libstdc++.so.5

Just installed a new system from stage one, its updated to gcc 3.4.4 and what not which doesn't have libstdc++.so.5

http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-2970910.html#2970910

Needed to emerge sys-libs/libstdc++-v3 which fixed the errors

I don't understand what are you requesting here, ati-drivers depend on libstdc++-v3 if gcc-3.3 is not installed - see the ebuild.

|| ( sys-libs/libstdc++-v3 =sys-devel/gcc-3.3* )"

IT didn't pull it in for me, having jumped straight to gcc 3.4 when i installed, then installed ati drivers aftewards.

I don't pretend to understand ebuilds... but to me i'd read that as install libstdc++ if gcc equals 3.3, not if it does not (i.e. > ) 3.3
