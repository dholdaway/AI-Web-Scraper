(“Clean Harbors”) (NYSE: CLH), the leading provider of environmental and industrial services throughout North America, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023.“Our Environmental Services (ES) segment capped a year of record growth with an outstanding fourth quarter,” said Mike Battles, Co-Chief Executive Officer. “Demand for our ES services remained robust, as steady volumes, healthy project flow and continued customer interest in our service offerings drove favorable pricing. Our Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions (SKSS) segment fell short of our expectations in Q4, as market conditions for base oil deteriorated late in the year. From a safety perspective, we concluded 2023 with an excellent fourth-quarter Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR), enabling us to far exceed our annual goal and achieve the best safety year in our history.”Fourth-Quarter ResultsRevenues grew 5% to $1.34 billion compared with $1.28 billion in the same period of 2022. Income from operations increased by 16% to $147.3 million compared with $127.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.Net income was $98.3 million, or $1.81 per diluted share compared with $82.5 million, or $1.52 per diluted share, for the same period in 2022. Adjusted net income in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $98.7 million, or $1.82 per diluted share, compared with $78.5 million, or $1.44 per diluted share in the prior year period. (See reconciliation tables below).Adjusted EBITDA (see description below) grew 14% to $254.9 million compared with $224.2 million in the same period of 2022.Clean Harbors • 42 Longwater Drive • PO Box 9149 • Norwell, Massachusetts 02061-9149 • 800.282.0058 • www.cleanharbors.comThe following information was filed by Clean Harbors Inc (CLH) on Wednesday, February 21, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.

 Inside Clean Harbors Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
These factors, among others, could significantly impact the impairment analysis and may result in future goodwill or asset impairment charges that, if incurred, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.



 Legal - Other   Highlight
Events not anticipated (such as future changes in environmental laws and regulations) could require that payments to satisfy our environmental liabilities be made earlier or in greater amounts than currently anticipated, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Remedial liabilities are inherently difficult to estimate and there is a risk that the actual quantities of contaminants could differ from the results of the site investigation, which could materially impact the amount of our liability.

 Other - Other   Highlight
However, if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from the amounts recorded.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Legal liabilities are typically comprised of litigation matters that involve potential liability for certain aspects of environmental cleanup and can include third-party claims for property damage or bodily injury allegedly arising from or caused by exposure to hazardous substances originating from our activities or operations or, in certain cases, from the action or inaction of other persons or companies.
