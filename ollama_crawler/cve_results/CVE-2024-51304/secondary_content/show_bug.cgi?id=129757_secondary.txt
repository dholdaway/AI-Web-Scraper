Description

When I had libgnomeprintui-2.10.2, I couldn't emerge (update) librsvg to 2.12.7 (neither to 2.14.2; from 2.9.5) - "/usr/lib/libgnomeprintui-2-2.so: undefined reference to `gp_gc_set_data'" occured during linking. The problem disappeared when updated libgnomeprintui to 2.12.1.

IMHO, librsvg-2.12.7.ebuild and librsvg-2.14.2.ebuild should be updated, RDEPEND shall include >=libgnomeprintui-2.12.1. I don't know if it's depend on USE (e.g. +gnome).

Regards.
M.

afaik gp_* comes from the gnome-print, which is a gnome1 lib. I don't really see how this could happen. The fact that you recompiled (updated) libgnomeprintui probably fixed the incorrect linking, but if you remerge libgnomeprintui-2.10.2, can you reproduce the linking problem ?

You are right. When I came back to libgnomeprintui-2.10.2, I could re-emerge librsvg-2.12.7 without the problem.

Given there are no further reports and it is not consistently reproducable, closing.

thanks for the report.
