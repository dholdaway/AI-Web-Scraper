 Inside Global Net Lease, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Debt   Highlight
Interest rate increases could increase the interest expense on our floating rate debt or any new debt and we are constantly evaluating the use of hedging strategies to mitigate this risk.



 Financial - Debt   Highlight
Such letter of credit is recalculated and increased (but never decreased) every three-month period until such time as the borrowers demonstrate compliance with the debt service coverage ratio required by the loan for a period of two consecutive calendar quarters.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Set forth below is a summary of the significant accounting estimates and accounting policies that management believes are important to the preparation of our financial statements.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Under lease accounting rules, we are required to assess, based on credit risk only, if it is probable that we will collect virtually all of the lease payments at lease commencement date and we must continue to reassess collectability periodically thereafter based on new facts and circumstances affecting the credit risk of the tenant.

 Other - Other   Highlight
