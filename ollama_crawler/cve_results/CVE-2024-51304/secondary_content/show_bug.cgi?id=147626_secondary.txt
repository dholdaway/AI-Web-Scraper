Description

I can get the gentoo and emergence splash themes to boot with the appropriate splash screens, but both the 2006.1 and 2006.0 result in following error on boot:

  Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)

Here's another error I get when I try to force the splash_manager to use one of the livecd builds:

  root# splash_manager --theme=livecd-2006.1 --cmd=set --tty=1
  Not a JPEG File: starts with 0x89 0x50

and upon further looking, there is no *.jpg files in the /etc/splash/livecd-2006.1/images/ directory! There are jpg files in the /etc/splash/emergence/images and /etc/splash/gentoo/images directories, so what happened between then and 2006.0 and 2006.1?

Also, let's try doing a demo:

  root# splash_manager -c demo -t livecd-2006.1 -m s --steps=100
  Not a JPEG file: starts with 0x89 0x50

Again, emergence and gentoo work fine, but the livecd themes are not working at all. I'm going to try to convert the PNG files to JPEG's and put them in the directories to see if that fixes the issue, but if anyone has anything to add on how to go about fixing this, anything would be of great help.

Okay, I've officially determined what was going on. I didn't have "png" set in my USE flags, and since I realized that there were no JPG images in the livecd diretories, I figured that might be what happened to it. Thus, as soon as I added png to my USE flags and recompiled splash utils, it worked!
