Hmm, I was unable to reproduce this problem. I see you have the 'debug' flag
turned on. Does gg2 provide any useful information? Is there a specific event
that seems to be causing the crash? Have you tried merging it with 'nostrip' in
features and running gg2 under gdb?

gnugadu 2.2.8 is old, close?

Please reopen if the problem persists with gnugadu-2.3.0.
