Description

i have all of my music files stored on a vfat partition: /mnt/drive_c/Music

when i click the "add to playlist" or the eject button, and i go to browse through my collection, i cannot go into any of the artist folders. xmms exists and crashes, reports "segmentation fault".  i can go this far: /mnt/drive_c/Music/Aphex Twin/, but if i try to go into any of the subdirectories the program just crashes!

HOWEVER, when i restart xmms, the file browsing dialog is already in the "Aphex Twin" directory and i can successfully browse the albums from there and add files.  if i happen to go back to the music folder though, the same thing happens.

NOTE, also, that if i browse from /mnt/drive_c/Music to /mnt/drive_c/Music/Aphex Twin/, and then i go back to my root music directory, it displays only the files with foreign characters in them, like "Bjork" (o with umlaut two dots on top). Also, i cannot open any folders with non-english characters!

It must have something to do with filesystem/codepage discrepancy?
I also have a samba-mounted filesystem with such files and it behaves the same way.  My default character set in linux kernel is ISO8859-1. i also have support for cp437.  files do not read properly in my terminal, though? perhaps i will try to compile enabling all charsets?

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Browse from folder (using eject button or add to playlist) /mnt/drive_c/music/, where files with non-english characters reside, to a subdirectory, "Artist Name"
2.Once i am in the artist directory, and i click on a subdirectory to get to the album, "Album Name" xmms exits with segmentation fault.
3.

Actual Results:  
segmentation fault

Expected Results:  
opened "/mnt/drive_c/music/artist/album" and showed me a list of files to add to
playlist or to play.

mounted vfat, samba partitions.  permissions are correct.  only happens when
there are filenames with non-english characters in them.

Please do not directly assign bugs unless you know where they go, let bug-wranglers handle them.

What versions of xmms have this problem?  Which versions don't?
