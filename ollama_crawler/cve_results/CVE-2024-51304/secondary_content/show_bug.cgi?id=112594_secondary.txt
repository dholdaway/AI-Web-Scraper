I installed the python ide eric3 on my system. Python is 2.4.2.  
Unfortunately the debugger only works as user root, not for the normal user.  
Starting a script also only works as root. 
To correct this, I changed the owner of eric3 to $user, but this doesn't work. 
So I think the problem is on python itself or an other underlying package.

Well, I've tried with the latest version of eric3 (3.9.3) and I don't have a problem to start the debugger. Also starting a script works without problems.
