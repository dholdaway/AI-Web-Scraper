[...]Check for symbolic links
eval make -f unix/Makefile zips `cat flags`
make: illegal option -- -
usage: make [-BPSXeiknqrstv] [-C directory] [-D variable]
        [-d flags] [-E variable] [-f makefile] [-I directory]
        [-j max_jobs] [-m directory] [-V variable]
        [variable=value] [target ...]
gmake: *** [generic] Error 2

!!! ERROR: app-arch/zip-2.31-r1 failed.

Commenting MAKEFLAGS in make.conf fixes this.
