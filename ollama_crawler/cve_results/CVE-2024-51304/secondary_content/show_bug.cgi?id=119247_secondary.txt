Description


Brett Boren





          2006-01-16 17:42:03 UTC
        

when setup as an ldap client, ntpdate fails with the following message:

Error : Servname not supported for ai_socktype
16 Jan 19:38:36 ntpdate[29656]: can't find host time.nist.gov

16 Jan 19:38:36 ntpdate[29656]: no servers can be used, exiting

Switching back to a non-ldap nsswitch.conf causes ntpdate to run correctly.

Have you add ldap in hosts?

fernando ~ # cat /etc/nsswitch.conf | grep -i hosts
hosts:       files dns

I look a dns resolv problem.

looks like a configuration bug, not a bug in ntp
