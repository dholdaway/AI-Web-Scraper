Exhibit 99.1

ORLANDO, FL, February 28, 2024 - United Parks & Resorts Inc. (NYSE: PRKS), a leading theme park and entertainment company, today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023. 
Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights
•Attendance was a record 5.0 million guests, an increase of approximately 23,000 guests from the fourth quarter of 2022.

•Attendance was 21.6 million guests, a decrease of 0.3 million guests or 1.5% from fiscal 2022. 
•Total revenue was $1,726.6 million, a decrease of $4.7 million or 0.3% from fiscal 2022.

Other Highlights
•The Board of Directors voted to recommend a new $500 million share buyback authorization, subject to approval by non-Hill Path shareholders.
•During fiscal 2023, the Company repurchased 313,750 shares for an aggregate total of approximately $17.9 million. 
•During fiscal 2023, the Company came to the aid of 335 animals in need in the wild.  The total number of animals the Company has helped over its history is more than 41,000.
“We are pleased to report another quarter and fiscal year of strong financial results,” said Marc Swanson, Chief Executive Officer of United Parks & Resorts Inc. “In the fourth quarter we delivered record attendance and record in park per capita spending despite adverse weather impacts, in particular across our Florida markets during peak visitation periods and an unfavorable calendar shift in the quarter. For the full year we delivered near record results and grew our total revenue per capita for the 6th year in a row despite significant adverse weather impacts throughout the year.  We estimate that weather related and calendar shift impacts reduced attendance by approximately 75,000 visits in the fourth quarter and that weather related impacts reduced attendance by over 370,000 visits for the full year.”
“Weather aside, we continue to drive growth in total revenue per capita including growth in admissions per capita, and in-park per capita, which has increased for 15 consecutive quarters, demonstrating the effectiveness of our revenue strategies, our pricing power and the strength of consumer spending in our parks.  Also, in 2023 along with our partners we successfully opened our first SeaWorld park outside of the United States in Abu Dhabi, which has been extremely well received and is performing ahead of expectations. In addition, we made meaningful investments across our parks and business that we are confident will deliver strong returns and will be a source of growth and profitability this year and into the future,” said Marc Swanson, Chief Executive Officer of United Parks & Resorts Inc. “I want to thank our ambassadors for all their dedicated efforts in 2023.” 
"Our attendance levels for fiscal 2023 were still below levels achieved in 2019, primarily due to a decline in international and group attendance which we are confident will recover to and surpass pre-COVID levels.  We are also still more than 3 million visitors below our historical high attendance of approximately 25 million guests achieved in 2008.  Our clear opportunity to drive meaningfully more attendance to our parks combined with our demonstrated ability to continue to grow total per capita spending, manage and reduce costs and achieve strong returns on our investments give us high confidence in our ability to continue to deliver operational and financial improvements that will lead to meaningful increases in shareholder value” continued Swanson.
“We are excited about our plans for 2024, including an incredible line-up of new, one-of-a kind rides, attractions and events, improved in park venues and offerings across our parks. We are also really excited about celebrating SeaWorld Parks 60th anniversary this year which kicks off across our SeaWorld parks on March 21st and will run through the whole year. There will be even more reasons to visit our SeaWorld parks this year with special events, shows, attractions and a whole lot more. We are happy to report that our new rides and attractions are all currently scheduled to open before the peak summer season.  We are also encouraged to see 2024 bookings trending ahead of prior year for both group sales and our Discovery Cove Property. We expect meaningful growth and new records in revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for 2024,” concluded Swanson.

 Inside Seaworld Entertainment, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Any changes to the operating schedule of a park such as increasing operating days for our historically seasonal parks, could change the impact of seasonality in the future.



 Financial - Debt   Highlight
Depending on conditions in the credit and capital markets and other factors, we will, from time to time, consider other financing transactions, the proceeds of which could be used to refinance our indebtedness or for other purposes.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Changes in school calendars that impact traditional school vacation breaks and/or start dates could also impact attendance patterns.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
Through December 31, 2020, approximately $65.6 million of valuation allowances were established for some of our deferred tax assets, which, based on our analysis at the time, we believed did not meet the “more likely than not” criteria and would expire before being realized in future periods.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Certain admission products may also include bundled products at the time of purchase, such as food and beverage or merchandise items.
