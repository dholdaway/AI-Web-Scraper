 Inside Haynes International Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Effective December 31, 2007, the U.S. pension plan was amended to freeze benefits for all non-union employees in the U.S. Effective September 30, 2009, the U.K. pension plan was amended to freeze benefits for employees in that plan.



 Revenue - Product   Highlight
The global COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected this market; however, sales declines in fiscal 2020 were mitigated by the Company's market share gains as well as restocking beginning to occur in the supply chain.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
As volume continued to rise during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, incremental profitability leverage helped improve gross margins significantly when considering neutral raw material impact.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Fiscal 2023 volumes in the chemical processing industry (CPI) decreased 20.8% compared to the prior year; however, the CPI average selling price per pound increased 26.7%, resulting in flat revenue compared to the prior year.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
Gross profit in fiscal 2023 decreased compared to the prior year as gross profit in fiscal 2023 was adversely impacted by higher raw material prices included in cost of sales relative to the impact of raw material price adjustors in selling prices, which decreased gross profit.
