Description


Vladimir





          2013-07-28 09:46:22 UTC
        

I have several jabber accounts in net-im/gajim-0.15.4, and today I discovered that when I open the chat history, my nickname in it is not from the current account. So, for example, if I have the accounts "user1", "user2" and "user3", in their chat histories I would see these nicknames:
- "user1" for "user1" account
- "user3" for "user2" account
- "user1" for "user3" account
  However, all the nicknames are correct in the chat windows themselves. The problem is just in the history.

Reproducible: Always

I cannot reproduce this bug. Do you mean a history of chat for a single contact?

Please reopen if you find it's still an issue.
