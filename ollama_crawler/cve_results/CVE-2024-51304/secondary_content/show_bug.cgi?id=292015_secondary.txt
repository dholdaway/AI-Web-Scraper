/usr/lib/gcc/i686-pc-linux-gnu/4.3.4/../../../../i686-pc-linux-gnu/bin/ld: cannot find -lpthreads

This is most likely a distcc issue per above. Can you try without?

nope it isn't a distcc bug.

Behavior still is the same even if I

$ FEATURES="-distcc" emerge kgamma

The main error is that there simply is no rule to ``make install''. - But why this?
