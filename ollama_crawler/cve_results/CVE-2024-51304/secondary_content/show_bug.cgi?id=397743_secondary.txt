Description

Please add support for multiple python versions of mod_wsgi. Currently mod_wsgi only builds against the active version of python. This makes managing the installation of the package very painful if one needs to change the active version of python each time to update mod_wsgi.

I propose to add means to the www-apache/mod_wsgi ebuild to make it build different versions of itself, linked against different (installed) versions of python (e.g. a version of mod_wsgi for each installed/selected python ebuild slot).

Since a single apache instance can probably only handle one mod_wsgi module at a time, I propose that the user can choose the *.so to load in 70_mod_wsgi.conf and that the default modules/mod_wsgi.so implementation can be selected via eselect.

This sounds way complex, and I don't see much benefit. If you really want it, write some patches and I will consider it. Until then, closing this.
