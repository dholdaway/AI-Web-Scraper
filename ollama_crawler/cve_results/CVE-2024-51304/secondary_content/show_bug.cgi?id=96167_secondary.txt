games-engines/exult requires "playmidi". To fullfill requirement add media-sounds/playmidi to the requirements.

Additional info:
Without "playmidi" exult won't start; the error-message is not helpful.

works fine for me and I don't have playmidi installed.  Since you didn't really
provide enough information to help you though there's not much I can do for you.
