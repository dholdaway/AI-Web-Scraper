 Inside Manhattan Associates Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Debt   Highlight
The forecast for 2024–25 is, however, below the historical (2000–19) average of 3.8 percent, with elevated central bank policy rates to fight inflation, a withdrawal of fiscal support amid high debt weighing on economic activity, and low underlying productivity growth.



 Financial - Income   Highlight
Other (loss) income, net primarily includes interest income, foreign currency gains and losses, and other non-operating expenses.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
The effective tax rate in 2023 decreased from 2022 mainly due to a decrease of expense from a favorable tax law change allowing creditability of foreign tax offset by a decrease of net excess tax benefits on restricted stock vesting and adjustments for tax contingencies.

 Other - Other   Highlight
To the extent there are material differences between those estimates, judgments, or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected.

 M & A - Other   Highlight
Any material acquisition could result in a decrease to our working capital depending on the amount, timing, and nature of the consideration to be paid.
