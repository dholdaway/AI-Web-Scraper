profiles/base/use.mask masks input_device_synaptics and input_devices_wacom,
and there are (inconsistent) unmasks in use.mask of individual profiles.

I do not see how these are arch specific (compared to input_devices_evdev).
There is no asm and grepping for archs does not give anything relevant.
As long as you have USB you should be able to plug in and use your Wacom
tablet.

If I haven't overlooked something, please remove the entries do the
corresponding clean up in the other profiles.


Reproducible: Always

The mask is correct.

It exists due to keywording differences between x11-base/xorg-drivers and the individual x11-drivers/xf86-input-* packages.

Where the packages can be used, they are unmasked.. i.e.:
profiles/arch/amd64/use.mask:-input_devices_wacom

The wacom mask might be refined a bit more on alpha or sparc, but they are most likely rare on those arches or bugs would appear for them.

You can test the repercussions yourself by editing profiles/base/use.mask locally then going into x11-drivers/xf86-input-synaptics and running `repoman full`
