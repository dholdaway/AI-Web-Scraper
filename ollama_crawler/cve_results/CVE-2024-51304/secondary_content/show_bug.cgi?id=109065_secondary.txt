Description

The driver gets copied to the wrong location
[http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=82595].  Furthermore, the links go not
seem to get created or removed properly for libglx.so.

I got around this with 7667 by remove opengl-update, eselect-opengl, and
nvidia-glx.  Reverting to complete stock, install eselect-opengl and nvidia-glx.
 However, I have been unable to actually make all of this behave properly, and I
thought I had better file a bug report.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Unmask and install eselect w/ the opengl component
2.unmask and install nvidia-glx-7676
3.try to make nvidia binary drivers work.

Actual Results:  
Unable to find module nvidia. [X module, newbies will be mislead to think this
is a kernel or /dev management problem]  


Expected Results:  
X Startup.

remove /usr/lib/modules/extensions/libglx.a
ln -s /usr/lib/opengl/nvidia/extensions/libglx.so
/usr/lib/modules/extensions/libglx.so

cp /usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers/nvidia_drv.o /usr/lib/modules/drivers/
cp /usr/lib/xorg/libXvMCNVIDIA.so.1.0.7676 /usr/lib

ldconfig

restart X

It's working for me.  Can you please tell me the version of eselect-opengl? 
Where are the links pointing that are incorrect?

I'm assuming this might've been with an old version as it's working for me.  Please 
reopen and provide more info if it's still a problem for you. 
 
Thanks.
