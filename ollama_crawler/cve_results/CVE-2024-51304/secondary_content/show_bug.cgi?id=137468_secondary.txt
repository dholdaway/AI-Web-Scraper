Description


Joe Wells





          2006-06-21 02:15:06 UTC
        

The ebuilds for x11-libs/gtk+-2.8.Y where Y is 17, 18, or 19 all use
"inherit virtualx".  Thus, whenever "X" is in USE, they depend on
x11-base/xorg-server.  However, they don't actually use the features
of virtualx unless "test" is in FEATURES.  Thus, they should not
depend on x11-base/xorg-server in this case.

I have a machine that does not run an X server but runs X clients that
use GTK+, and so portage is now trying to pull in xorg-server even
though it is not needed (it is not used for building or running the
GTK+ library).

Can you help?

echo "x11-libs/gtk+ -X" >> /etc/portage/package.keywords. FEATURES don't turn use flags on/off, and we don't have per-package features yet.

Meh... echo "x11-libs/gtk+ -X" >> /etc/portage/package.use (not package.keywords) will obviously work better, and I need coffee.
