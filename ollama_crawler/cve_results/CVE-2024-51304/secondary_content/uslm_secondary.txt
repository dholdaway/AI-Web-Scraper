 Exhibit 99.1​UNITED STATES LIME & MINERALS, INC. — NEWS RELEASE​​​​​FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE​​Contact: Timothy W. Byrne​​​  (972) 991-8400UNITED STATES LIME & MINERALS REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2023RESULTS AND DECLARES INCREASED REGULAR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDDallas, Texas, February 2, 2024 - United States Lime & Minerals, Inc. (NASDAQ: USLM) today reported fourth quarter and full year 2023 results:  The Company’s revenues in the fourth quarter 2023 were $65.7 million, compared to $58.3 million in the fourth quarter 2022, an increase of $7.4 million, or 12.7%.  For the full year 2023, the Company’s revenues were $281.3 million, compared to $236.2 million in the full year 2022, an increase of $45.2 million, or 19.1%.  Lime and limestone revenues were $65.4 million in the fourth quarter 2023, compared to $57.8 million in the fourth quarter 2022, an increase of $7.6 million, or 13.1%.  For the full year 2023, lime and limestone revenues were $280.2 million, compared to $233.4 million in the full year 2022, an increase of $46.8 million, or 20.0%.  The increases in revenues in the fourth quarter and full year 2023, compared to the comparable 2022 periods, resulted from increases in average selling prices for the Company’s lime and limestone products, partially offset by decreased sales volumes.  The decrease in sales volumes in the fourth quarter 2023, compared to the fourth quarter 2022, was principally due to decreased demand from the Company’s industrial and construction customers, partially offset by increased demand from its roofing and oil and gas services customers.  The decrease in sales volumes in the full year 2023, compared to the full year 2022, were principally due to decreased demand from the Company’s industrial, steel, and construction customers, partially offset by increased demand from the Company’s roofing, environmental, and oil and gas services customers.The Company’s gross profit was $23.6 million in the fourth quarter 2023, compared to $16.8 million in the fourth quarter 2022, an increase of $6.8 million, or 40.4%.  The Company’s gross profit was $102.9 million in the full year 2023, compared to $70.3 million in the full year 2022, an increase of $32.5 million, or 46.2%.  The Company’s lime and limestone gross profit was $23.6 million in the fourth quarter 2023, compared to $16.6 million in the fourth quarter 2022, an increase of $7.0 million, or 41.9%. The Company’s lime and limestone gross profit in the full year 2023 was $102.9 million, compared to $69.0 million in the full year 2022, an increase of $34.0 million, or 49.2%.  The increases in gross profit in the fourth quarter and full year 2023, compared to the comparable 2022 periods, resulted primarily from the increased revenues discussed above, partially offset by increased production costs, principally from higher energy, labor, and parts and supplies costs.Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $4.6 million in the fourth quarter 2023, compared to $4.5 million in the fourth quarter 2022, an increase of $0.1 million, or 1.9%.  SG&A expenses were $17.4 million in the full year 2023, compared to $15.6 million in the full year 2022, an increase of $1.9 million, or 12.1%. The increases in SG&A expenses in the 2023 periods, compared to the comparable 2022 periods, were primarily due to increased personnel expenses.Other (income) expense, net was $2.4 million and $7.9 million in the fourth quarter and full year 2023, respectively, compared to $1.2 million and $1.8 million in the fourth quarter and full year 2022, respectively. The increases of $1.3 million and $6.2 million in other (income) expense, net, during the respective 2023 periods, compared to the comparable 2022 periods, were primarily due to higher interest rates earned on higher average balances of cash and cash equivalents. The Company reported net income of $17.0 million ($2.98 per share diluted) and $74.5 million ($13.06 per share diluted) in the fourth quarter and full year 2023, respectively, compared to $10.8 million ($1.90 per share diluted) and $45.4 million ($8.00 per share diluted) in the fourth quarter and full year 2022, respectively, reflecting increases of $6.2 million, or 57.5%, and $29.1 million, or 64.1%, respectively. “While we are pleased with our financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2023, reduced demand in the fourth quarter from our industrial and construction customers continued to generate headwinds for us. Increased demand from our roofing and oil and gas customers was an encouraging offset to overall decreases in volume,” said ​The following information was filed by United States Lime Minerals Inc (USLM) on Friday, February 2, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.

 Inside United States Lime Minerals Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Expense   Highlight
However, there can be no assurance that demand and prices for our lime and limestone products will enable us to fully utilize our additional production capacity, nor that our production will not be adversely affected by weather, maintenance, environmental, accident, cybersecurity, and other operational and construction issues; that we can successfully invest in improvements to our existing facilities and acquisitions; that our results will not be adversely affected by increases in fuel, natural gas, electricity, transportation and freight costs, taxes, or new environmental, health and safety, or other regulatory requirements; or that, with increasing competition with other lime and limestone producers, our revenues, gross profit, net income, and cash flows can be maintained or improved.



 Financial - Income   Highlight
The increase in other income, net in 2023 compared to 2022, was due to higher interest rates earned on higher average balances in our cash and cash equivalents.
