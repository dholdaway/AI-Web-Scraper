Description

          2009-09-28 07:47:26 UTC
        

after the recent update from version 2.0.1.156745-r2 to 2.0.1.156745-r3 (including vmware modules from 1.0.0.24 to 1.0.0.24-r1) i cannot (re)start my vmware-server. before updating i stopped all the virtual machines running, updated modules and server and then tried to restart vmware-server.
but i got this message:

area52 hostd # /etc/init.d/vmware restart
 * Stopping VMware autostart virtual machines:
 *   Virtual Machines                                 [ !! ]
 * Stopping VMware management services:
 *   VMware Server Host Agent                         [ !! ]
 * Stopping VMware services:
 *   VMware Authentication Daemon                     [ ok ]
 *   VM communication interface socket family:        [ ok ]
 *   Virtual machine communication interface          [ ok ]
 *   Virtual machine monitor                          [ ok ]
 *   Bridged networking on /dev/vmnet0                [ ok ]
 *   Host network detection                           [ ok ]
 *   Virtual ethernet                                 [ ok ]
 * VMware is not properly configured! See above.         

i also stopped xinetd (which starts vmware-authd), and reloaded the vmware modules vmci, vmnet and vmmon. but no success. i cannot restart vmware-server anymore. i can also not find any vmware processes on my machine.

i use kernel 2.6.30-gentoo-r5, use flag ~amd64 for vmware-server and vmware-server modules.

Please try:
$ sudo /opt/vmware/server/bin/vmware-config.pl --skip-stop-start
