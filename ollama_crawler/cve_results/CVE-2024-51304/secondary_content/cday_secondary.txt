 Inside Ceridian Hcm Holding Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 M & A - Other   Highlight
From time to time, we have made investments in businesses or acquisitions of companies.



 Revenue - Product   Highlight
The net positive cash inflow in both periods is primarily due to our growing revenue, partially offset by our operating costs, mainly, investment in our sales force to support our growth initiatives and our product development and management costs which are not eligible for capitalization.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Selling and marketing expense decreased $1.3 million, or 0.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.

 Other - Other   Highlight
As of December 31, 2023, we will continue to record a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets including state net operating loss carryovers and tax basis intangibles.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
To the extent this consideration exceeds the customer billings, a contract asset would be recognized, as professional services revenue related to implementation activities is generally recognized at the beginning of the contract.
