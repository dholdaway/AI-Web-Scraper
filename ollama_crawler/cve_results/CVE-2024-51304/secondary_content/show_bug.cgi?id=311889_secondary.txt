"emerge --update --newuse --deep --ask world" tries to install libwpg.

build of libpwg fails with info in attached log, emake failed.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.emerge --sync
2.emerge --update world
3.libwpg fails to build

Actual Results:  
error as attached log

Expected Results:  
either libwpg should not be pulled into the dependency tree, or emerge should complete successfully


"emerge --info libwpg" reports

!!! '=/media-libs/libpwg-0.1.3' is not a valid package atom.
!!! Please check ebuild(5) for full details.

and "emerge -pqv libwpg" reports

!!! '/media-libs/libpwg' is not claimed by any package.


Computer has 3GB of RAM and /var/tmp/portage is mounted in RAM (+2GB swap IIRC) all other ebuilds, including mysql build correctly.

df -h output:

Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda6              47G   43G  1.4G  97% /
udev                   10M  200K  9.9M   2% /dev

From your emerge --info:
> LANG="en_GB.UTF-8 UTF-8"

Try with only a single locale specified in the LANG environment variable.
