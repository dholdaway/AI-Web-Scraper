Description


Markus Wernig





          2016-05-09 11:23:43 UTC
        

Sorry, I can't tell which package is causing this ... (pulseaudio?)

After an ~amd64 @world update (May 8 2016) and reboot, inserting a headphone (or external speaker) into the audio jack does no longer switch from internal speaker to headphone. The sound just keeps on being played over the speakers. This had worked without problems before.

The desktop is plasma.

Side note: When attaching the headphones and switching the output device ("Connector") manually to "Headphones" (in System Settings -> Multimedia -> Audio and Video -> Audio Hardware Setup -> Device Configuration), the internal speakers are muted, but still no sound is output on the headphones or external speakers (tested with various models, all of which had worked before).

I'll gladly provide any debugging information, but for the time being I'm totally lost at where to start looking ...

Thanks for looking into this.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Insert headphone or external speaker in audio jack
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Sound keeps playing via internal speakers.

Expected Results:  
Sound should switch to headphone/external speaker, and the internal speakers should be muted.

Maybe related:

When starting media-sound/amarok, amarok's volume is automatically set to zero, regardless of what it was before amarok was closed, and without it playing any stream.
This is reported via an OSD popup.

I have a similar issue: if I plug/unplug headphones during playback then the output successfully changes. If I plug/unplug headphones when audio is paused (the player is still open) then the output is not changed.

Really curious what's the cause here.

Markus do you have the log of your update (see /var/log/emerge.log)?
Please attach the relevant part. It could help to know what packages were actually updated.

Aha! No pulseaudio in this list. However another interesting piece is gentoo-sources. I suspect it could be caused by a nasty kernel upgrade on my machine.
Did you happen to upgrade your kernel recently?

I upgraded the kernel only AFTER the problem appeared, and it does occur with both (4.5.2 and 4.5.3) kernels.

Good news - kind of.

After doing a @world update today, the problem went away.

I've attached the list of packages that were pulled in during the update, fwiw.

@Coacher: From my point of view, this is now RESOLVED WORKSFORME, but I leave that up to you.

Thank you.
This is still a problem for me though. Looks like it could be related to audio power-saving. I am closing this as it seems we have different issues after all.
