My Xorg-server crashes randomly using latest nvidia driver 190.42-r3 and KDE4.3.3 with this error message:

[...] 
Backtrace: 
0: /usr/bin/X (xorg_backtrace+0x3b) [0x80ad3db] 
1: /usr/bin/X (0x8048000+0x62cb5) [0x80aacb5] 
2: (vdso) (__kernel_rt_sigreturn+0x0) [0xb771a40c] 
Segmentation fault at address 0xde021000 

Fatal server error: 
Caught signal 11 (Segmentation fault). Server aborting 
[...]

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
I don't know how to reproduce it exactly, but I think it is using of Thunderbird, maybe every gtk app.

Created attachment 211403 [details]
nv bug report log file

I think this isn't really helpful...

Made this after xorg crash. Nvidia bug report script completed successfully.
