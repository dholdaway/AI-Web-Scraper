Please provide more output as that does not show the error at all.

Ok, im compiling qt again, i emerge --synced in the meantime, which has had the result that some other things need compiling aswell, however emerge -uN qt seems to want mysql and sqlite to be updated/rebuilt first, which wasnt the case before, maybe this is the cause of the error. I had afterall added the mysql and sqlite useflags.

More info to follow, as the compile happens.

compilation is not the problem. what seemed to be the problem is that by adding the sqlite useflag it wanted to emerge qt with sqlite support even thought the emerging of sqlite was schedule for later in that same emerge run.

I think Qt links against it's own internal copy of sqlite and not the portage supplied copy, so I don't think that's a problem.

That would still not explain why it emerged correctly after sqlite had been emerged and not before.

True, but the output you should above doesn't actually show any error, just that there was an error, so it isn't possible to tell you what went wrong.
