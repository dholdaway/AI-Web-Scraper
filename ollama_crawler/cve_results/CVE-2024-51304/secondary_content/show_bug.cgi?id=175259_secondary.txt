As the patch breaks building for others (see bug #175410) I've reverted it. Could you provide complete build log and `emerge --info`?

Sorry for bug spam - I haven't finished my coffee yet.

Well, very strange...
I did have a weird iconv.h in /usr/local/include, deleting it solved the problem. Don't know where it come from, neither why GCC used it in priority to /usr/include/iconv.h, but now it works :/
Anyway, sorry for the trouble :(

dev-libs/libiconv maybe? But it's for *BSD only. I'm closing this as WORKSFORME.
