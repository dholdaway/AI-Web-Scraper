app-emulation/virtualbox-guest-additions-3.2.6 shows this error when the init is launched:

# /etc/init.d/virtualbox-guest-additions restart
 * Caching service dependencies ...                                             [ ok ]
 * Starting VirtualBox guest additions ...
 *      Loading kernel modules and creating devices
 *      Starting the vboxadd system service
/sbin/start-stop-daemon: stat /usr/sbin/vboxadd-service: No such file or directory (No such file or directory)
 * Failed to start VirtualBox guest additions

----

this happens because the init.d try to call a non existing /usr/sbin/vboxadd-service binary, which instead is called /usr/sbin/vboxguest-service; to fix the problem just rename all instances of 'vboxadd-service' as 'vboxguest-service' inside the file '/etc/init.d/virtualbox-guest-additions'.

I hope this will be useful.

p.s.: this exact problem and its solution have just been pointed out in the report #285977

I suppose you didn't update your init scripts after you installed virtualbox-guest-additions-3.2.6
The init script is already fixed (as can be seen by looking at the file virtualbox-guest-additions-7.initd).
Please make sure to use the updated init script.
