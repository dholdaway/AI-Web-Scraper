Description


Andrea Barisani (RETIRED)






          2006-07-28 04:21:52 UTC
        

Example:

in a LDAP setup root user needs /root/.ldaprc for client side certs (they cannot
be specified globally). In a LDAP setup recent baselayouts apparently mess with
$HOME during startup and services tries to find /.ldaprc instead of /root/.ldaprc.

Without that file things like courier-imap, sendmail, openssh with ldap patch and
so on will fail to load the proper configuration and require restarting after boot
for fixage.

Copying (or linking) /root/.ldaprc to / solves the problem but it's certainly ugly.

should work fine with baselayout-1.12.x

imho, putting config files in /root/ for services is stupid in the first place
