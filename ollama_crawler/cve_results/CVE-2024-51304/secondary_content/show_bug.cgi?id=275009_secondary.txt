When configuring your kernel using `make menuconfig', it would be useful to have a way to deselect all options marked as EXPERIMENTAL. I personally deselect them in the hopes that the result will be a more stable kernel. I imagine others may feel the same way.

Perhaps this is difficult to implement. This feature would be nice, but it is by no means a necessity. I thought I'd ask, though.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
N/A

This already exists. Disable the following option:

General Setup --->
    [ ] Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers

(or: EXPERIMENTAL=n )

(This option is under "Code maturity level options" in older kernels)
