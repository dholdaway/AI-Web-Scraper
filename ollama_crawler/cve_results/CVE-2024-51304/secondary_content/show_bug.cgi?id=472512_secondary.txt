Description

Hi,

I am seeing this sometimes after I boot my system (/var/log/messages)


Jun  6 16:28:24 mchandras-linux dhcpcd[1668]: version 5.99.6 starting
Jun  6 16:28:25 mchandras-linux dhcpcd[1668]: no interfaces have a carrier
Jun  6 16:28:25 mchandras-linux dhcpcd[1668]: forked to background, child pid 1691
Jun  6 16:28:25 mchandras-linux dhcpcd[1691]: eth0: waiting for carrier
Jun  6 16:28:27 mchandras-linux dhcpcd[1691]: eth0: carrier acquired
Jun  6 16:28:27 mchandras-linux dhcpcd[1691]: eth0: sending IPv6 Router Solicitation
Jun  6 16:28:27 mchandras-linux dhcpcd[1691]: eth0: sendmsg: Cannot assign requested address
Jun  6 16:28:27 mchandras-linux dhcpcd[1691]: eth0: rebinding lease of 192.168.154.67
Jun  6 16:28:27 mchandras-linux dhcpcd[1691]: eth0: acknowledged 192.168.0.2 from 192.168.0.254
Jun  6 16:28:27 mchandras-linux dhcpcd[1691]: eth0: checking for 192.168.0.2
Jun  6 16:28:32 mchandras-linux dhcpcd[1691]: eth0: leased 192.168.0.2 for 3600 seconds
Jun  6 16:29:44 mchandras-linux dhcpcd[1691]: received SIGTERM, stopping
Jun  6 16:29:44 mchandras-linux dhcpcd[1691]: eth0: removing interface
Jun  6 16:29:44 mchandras-linux dhcpcd[1691]: exited


So what happens here is that the dhcpcd init script starts, gets an IP and then for some reasons it gets a SIGTERM signals and exists rendering the future DHCP operations useless.

I haven't tested any previous dhcpcd versions on this system as I used to had a static IP in the past.

I must say that does not happen all the time.

This is my dhcpcd.conf file

mchandras # grep -v "^#\|^$" /etc/dhcpcd.conf
hostname
duid
option domain_name_servers, domain_name, domain_search, host_name
option classless_static_routes
option ntp_servers
require dhcp_server_identifier
nohook lookup-hostname
waitip

So something sent dhcpcd a SIGTERM.
Sadly dhcpcd doesn't know which PID sent it. I suppose I could code this into a future version.

I'll go out on a limb and suggest that the Gentoo network scripts are doing this. I would suggest adding dhcpcd to a runlevel by itself and let it work in peace.

Roy

I run dhcpcd on the boot runlevel. I have not net.eth* on any runlevel apart from net.lo which is also on the boot runlevel. Should I remove net.lo as well?

Hmmmm no, don't remove net.lo

You posted a log with dhcpcd-5.99.6. Does 5.99.7 behave the same way? Do you see the same problem with dhcpcd-5.5.x or dhcpcd-5.6.x?

I have 5.99.7 installed, rebooted the box, yet the log says that 5.99.6 is starting. Not sure why...

I just downgraded to 5.6.8. I will do a couple of reboots to see if I am able to reproduce it.

I am running 5.6.8 since this morning on two separate boxes and everything seems to work fine after multiple reboots. It could be a problem with 5.99.7 or it could have been a temporary problem and caused SIGTERM to be delivered. I am not going to do more tests since these are production systems so feel free to close this bug if you want to.

The next dhcpcd release will log the PID where the signal came from, which may or may not assist in debugging this.

Thanks. Once the new release is out I will update again

Hi Markos,

Is this still an issue with 6.0.2?

Thanks,

William

Ok, I'm closing this as worksforme. Markos, if this comes up again with
6.0.5, feel free to reopen.
