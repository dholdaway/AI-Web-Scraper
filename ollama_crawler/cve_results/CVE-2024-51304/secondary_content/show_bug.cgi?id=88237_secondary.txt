Description

When emerging ghostscript-fonts-std-8.11, the emerge fails when attempting to download the package from sourceforge.

This is because the ebuild is looking for the files at /ghostscript-fonts/ when they are infact at /gs-fonts/

I attempted to edit the ebuild, but this failed as I've never done it before. So I leave it up to someone who knows what they are doing!

Reproducible: Always

You mean: gnu-gs-fonts-std ?

Otherwise, can confirm that,...
