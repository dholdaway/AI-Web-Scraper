Description

The link in the URL section of this bug pretty much explains the whole problem. The font env variables aren't set by this e-build, so each user has to figure out what's going on, find the FAQ, then set the env variables locally. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge octave  (depends on gnuplot)
2. plot some data  (in octave)
3. print("examplePlot.png", "-dpng")


Actual Results:  
Plot with no text

Expected Results:  
plot with text

I use 

export GDFONTPATH=/usr/share/fonts/freefont-ttf/
export GNUPLOT_DEFAULT_GDFONT=FreeMono

in .bashrc as a work around.

Gnuplot should fallback to its internal font. Doesn't it do that for you?

> export GDFONTPATH=/usr/share/fonts/freefont-ttf/
> export GNUPLOT_DEFAULT_GDFONT=FreeMono

I'm reluctant to add such settings since it would require additional dependencies (media-fonts/freefont-ttf for your example).

No, not for sci-visualization/gnuplot-4.2.6 anyway...Maybe we can just mark this bug as ignore and people will see the bug report and that will be enough.

Not really a fix, but I've added the following einfo message to pkg_postinst:

+   if use gd; then
+       echo
+       einfo "For font support in png/jpeg/gif output, you may have to"
+       einfo "set the GDFONTPATH and GNUPLOT_DEFAULT_GDFONT environment"
+       einfo "variables. See the FAQ file in /usr/share/doc/${PF}/"
+       einfo "for more information."
+   fi
