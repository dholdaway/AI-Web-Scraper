Basically, I think that there should be a module to properly support networkmanager in /etc/conf.d/net. There is one for wpa_supplicant and this is nice because it starts and allows for delayed loading of services once the interfaces come up. I would like something similar for networkmanager.

Currently, all the how-to's on the internet suggest effectively disabling the gentoo network scripts, which in my opinion is a bit of a hacky solution.

Thanks.

Write something?  I seriously don't quite see what you are saying, NetworkManager is meant to replace the need for the net script.  That is the whole point of it, so while you may consider it to be "hacky" that is how it is.
