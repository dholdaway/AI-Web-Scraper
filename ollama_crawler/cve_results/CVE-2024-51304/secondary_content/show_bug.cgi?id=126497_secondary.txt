Updating zip from 2.3-r4 to 2.31 I get the following message:

QA Notice: the following files contain executable stacks
 Files with executable stacks will not work properly (or at all!)
 on some architectures/operating systems.  A bug should be filed
 at http://bugs.gentoo.org/ to make sure the file is fixed.
