Mpv only ebuild for smplayer

Hello,

if I emerge smplayer-17.11.2 or higher, it installs mplayer as a dependency, even if mpv in a recent version is already installed. 

I overcome this problem by adjusting the ebuild slightly. I did this by bouncing mlayer and youtube-dl as possible dependencies, only leaving mpv.

Now it works as expected. (But the resulting ebuild is not suitable for mplayer users anymore)

King regards 
GOS

From the ebuild:
>RDEPEND="${COMMON_DEPEND}
>        || (
>                media-video/mplayer[bidi?,libass,png,X]
>                (
>                        >=media-video/mpv-0.15.0[libass,X]
>                        >=net-misc/youtube-dl-2014.11.26
>                )
>        )
>"

So this means either just mplayer, or both mpv and youtube-dl together are required.
