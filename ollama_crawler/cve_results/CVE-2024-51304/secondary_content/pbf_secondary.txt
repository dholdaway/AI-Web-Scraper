PBF Energy Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Results, Declares Dividend of $0.25 per Share and Announces Increased Share Repurchase Authorization•Fourth quarter loss from operations of $47.2 million (excluding special items, fourth quarter loss from operations of $46.1 million)•Full year income from operations of $2,951.5 million (excluding special items, full year income from operations of $2,017.6 million) •Year-ending consolidated cash balance of approximately $1.8 billion•Returned more than $180 million to stockholders through dividends and share buybacks in the fourth quarter and approximately $640 million in the year•Increased total outstanding share repurchase authorization to over $1 billion with new $750 million approvalPARSIPPANY, NJ - February 15, 2024 - PBF Energy Inc. (NYSE:PBF) today reported fourth quarter 2023 loss from operations of $47.2 million as compared to income from operations of $955.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Excluding special items, fourth quarter 2023 loss from operations was $46.1 million as compared to income from operations of $873.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The company reported fourth quarter 2023 net loss of $48.4 million and net loss attributable to PBF Energy Inc. of $48.4 million or $(0.40) per share. This compares to net income of $656.1 million, and net income attributable to PBF Energy Inc. of $637.8 million or $4.86 per share for the fourth quarter of 2022. Special items in the fourth quarter 2023 results, which increased our results by a net, after-tax benefit of $0.7 million, or $0.01 per share, primarily consisted of net changes in the fair value of contingent consideration associated with the acquisition of the Martinez refinery and related logistics assets, and a benefit related to a change in the Tax Receivable Agreement liability, offset by a decrease to our gain on formation of Saint Bernard Renewables (“SBR”) equity method investment and our share of the SBR lower-of-cost-or-market ("LCM") inventory adjustment. Adjusted fully-converted net loss for the fourth quarter 2023, excluding special items, was $49.4 million, or $(0.41) per share on a fully-exchanged, fully-diluted basis, as described below, compared to adjusted fully-converted net income of $582.9 million or $4.41 per share, for the fourth quarter 2022.PBF's President and Chief Executive Officer Matthew Lucey said, “In 2023, we completed the transformation of PBF Energy's balance sheet. Our financial discipline has put PBF on the strongest financial footing in our history as a public company. Our operations delivered our second-best financial year.” Mr. Lucey continued, “In addition to enhancing equity value by further reducing debt by approximately $700 million, we demonstrated our commitment to shareholder returns by returning approximately $640 million through dividends and share buybacks in 2023. We are pleased to announce a $750 million increase to our buyback authorization, resulting in more than $1 billion in current capacity. We remain focused on delivering value to our shareholders.” 1The following information was filed by Pbf Energy Inc. (PBF) on Thursday, February 15, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.

 Inside Pbf Energy Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Our assumptions incorporate inherent uncertainties that are at times difficult to predict and could result in impairment charges or accelerated depreciation in future periods if actual results materially differ from the estimated assumptions used.



 Financial - Income   Highlight
The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income are reduced or increased or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as our projections for future taxable income.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Additionally, further decreases in overall inventory values could result in additional charges to cost of products sold should the LCM or market inventory valuation reserve be increased.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Such a reduction to cost of products sold could be significant if inventory values return to historical cost price levels.

 Other - Other   Highlight
We continually monitor our market risk exposure for market developments that could introduce significant volatility in the financial markets.
