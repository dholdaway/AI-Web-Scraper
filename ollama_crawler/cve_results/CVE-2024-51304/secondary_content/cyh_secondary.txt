 Inside Community Health Systems Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
A number of factors could affect the future results of the Company or the healthcare industry generally and could cause the Company’s expected results to differ materially from those expressed in this Form 10-K.



 Legal - Other   Highlight
However, due to the subjective nature of this estimate and the impact that previously unforeseen shifts in actual claim experience can have, future estimates of professional liability could be adversely impacted when actual paid losses develop unexpectedly based on assumptions and settlement events that were not previously known or anticipated.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Such changes impacting the calculation of our fair value could result in a material impairment charge in the future.

 Other - Other   Highlight
However, ongoing negative economic conditions (including inflationary conditions and elevated interest rate levels) have resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruptions of financial and capital markets, which could reduce our ability to access capital and negatively affect our liquidity in the future.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Future estimates of fair value could be adversely affected if the actual outcome of one or more of the assumptions described above changes materially in the future, including as a result of any decline in or increased volatility of our stock price and the fair value of our long-term debt, lower than expected hospital volumes and/or net operating revenues, higher market interest rates, increased operating costs or other adverse impacts on our financial results.
