gnome-mplayer should support mplayer2 as i can see in the ebuild:
 || ( >=media-video/mplayer-1.0_rc4_p20100101[ass] media-video/mplayer2[ass] )
but it doesn't work.

$ gnome-mplayer  music.mp3
Error when running: Failed to execute child process "mplayer" (No such file or directory)
Error when running: Failed to execute child process "mplayer" (No such file or directory)
Error when running: Failed to execute child process "mplayer" (No such file or directory)
in media state change with state = 0
$

You need to configure the command from the GUI to use mplayer2, it's not a out of box experience. Feel free to submit patch to upstream if you think it should be.

Just as a note: I was pointed out at upstream bugtracker that installing mplayer2 as 'mplayer2' is actually a Gentoo-specific behavior.
