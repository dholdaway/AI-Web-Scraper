I had the same problem. But it works correctly if you're running gnome-settings-daemon. I think it's a problem concerning to font size configuration rather than a bug.

yeah it is a font thing... and I don't use gnome I use fluxbox. are you talking about some graphical configuration tool? I don't know how to use those. They are too GUI-fied. I prefer to open the .conf in an editor and hack away. I got it figured out. Anarchy's (Pratt) works for me solution didn't help though.
