Updating to the latest rsbac-kernel I get this error:

!!! Couldn't download 'rsbac-hardened-patches-2.6.18-1.extras.tar.bz2'. Aborting.

That file is missing from all mirror I checked.

I just checked a few random mirrors from http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/mirrors.xml and the file was there with the correct checksum.
can you tell me which mirror you are using?

Problem solved. I opened this after checking at least 10 different mirrors. Maybe they were only slow to sync.
