Seems lile ~x86 masked version is more informartive regarding this problem:

 *  '/var/tmp/portage/sci-geosciences/googleearth-5.2.1.1588/temp/build.log'
 * Wrong checksum or file size means that Google silently replaced the distfile with a newer version.
 * Note that Gentoo cannot mirror the distfiles due to license reasons, so we have to follow the bump.
 * Please file a version bump bug on http://bugs.gentoo.org (search existing bugs for googleearth first!).
 * By redigesting the file yourself, you will install a different version than the ebuild says, untested!

>>> Failed to emerge sci-geosciences/googleearth-5.2.1.1588

Shouldn't this ebuild have some kind of no-size-check/no-sha-check directive?

The distfile for 5.1 is gone and now marked as fetch restricted. You have to either obtain it somewhere, or use 5.2 or 6.0 (which are now in tree, but ~arch). I will see if 5.2 can be stabilized.

Now it works for me with ~x86 keyword.
