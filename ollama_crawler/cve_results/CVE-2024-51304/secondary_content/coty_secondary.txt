 Coty Reports Double-Digit Growth in FY24, Outpacing Beauty MarketStrong Revenue Growth Across Prestige and Consumer Beauty in FY24Solid Gross Margin Expansion Supported by Multi-Lever StrategyFY25 Guidance In-line with Medium-Term Targets, Including Expected Sequential Growth Improvement in Q1 and 1H25 NEW YORK - August 20, 2024-- Coty Inc. (NYSE: COTY) (Paris: COTY) ("Coty" or "the Company") today announced its results for the full fiscal year 2024 and the fourth quarter, ended June 30, 2024. The Company delivered its fourth year of results ahead of or in-line with expectations, while consistently executing across its strategic growth pillars.In FY24, total net revenues grew 10% on a reported and 11% on a LFL basis, at the upper end of Coty's FY24 guidance range of +9% to +11% LFL, and ahead of the global beauty market which grew approximately 9%. The Company continued to deliver balanced reported net revenue growth, including growth in both Prestige and Consumer Beauty, across all regions and in each of its core categories. In FY24, Coty delivered a healthy reported growth mix with a low-single-digit percentage volume growth and a low double-digit percentage contribution from a combination of price, mix & other. In the second half of FY24, which largely balances out the elevated comparisons in the fourth quarter, net revenues grew 4% on a reported basis and 8% on a LFL basis, with reported results supported by growth across all core categories and regions. In 4Q24, Coty's net revenues grew 1% on a reported basis and 5% on a LFL basis, which includes several percentage points of impact from lapping an elevated comparison base in the prior year as retailers restocked following supply chain shortages. The Q4 reported sales growth was supported by growth in both prestige and mass fragrances, prestige cosmetics and mass skin & body care, partially offset by a 2% FX headwind and a 2% negative impact from the divestiture of the Lacoste license. These results were at the upper end of the Company's guidance for Q4 of low-to-mid single-digits percentage growth on a LFL basis. LFL revenue growth on company-wide basis and in the Americas region includes a contribution of 1% and 2%, respectively, from Argentina, which experienced hyperinflation.In FY24, Prestige net revenues grew a strong 13% on a reported and 14% on a LFL basis. In FY24, reported net revenue growth in Prestige was fueled by growth in fragrances, cosmetics and skincare. In the second half of FY24, which largely balances out the elevated prior year comparisons in Q4, Prestige net revenues grew 4% on a reported basis and 9% on a LFL basis. This second half Prestige reported growth was fueled by growth across fragrances, cosmetics and skincare partially offset by a headwind from the divestiture of the Lacoste license and a 1% headwind from FX. In 4Q24, Prestige net revenues were flattish on a reported basis and increased 6% on a LFL basis, which included a mid-single-digit headwind from elevated comparisons tied to retailer restocking in the prior year. Prestige reported net revenue growth in Q4 was driven by growth in fragrances and cosmetics and included a 4% negative impact from the divestiture of the Lacoste license and a 2% negative impact from FX. In FY24, Consumer Beauty revenues increased 6% on both a reported basis and LFL basis, with growth in color cosmetics, mass fragrances and mass skin & body care. In the second half of FY24, Consumer Beauty net revenues increased 4% on a reported basis, supported by growth in color cosmetics, mass fragrances and mass skin & body care, and 5% on a LFL basis. In 4Q24, Consumer Beauty net revenues increased 2% on a reported basis and 4% on a LFL basis, driven by very strong double-digit growth in mass fragrance and mass skincare. All regions generated high-single-digit to double-digit percentage reported net revenue growth in FY24. Americas net revenues rose 10% as reported and 12% LFL in FY24 and 3% as reported and 8% LFL in Q4. Americas reported net revenue growth in each of these periods was driven by strong high-single-digit to double-digit percentage growth in Latin America, Canada and the Travel Retail channel. EMEA's net revenues increased 11% as reported and LFL in FY24 and 1% as reported and 5% LFL in Q4. Reported net revenue growth in EMEA in both periods was supported by growth across many European markets, African markets and the Travel Retail channel. Asia Pacific net revenues grew 9% as reported and 11% LFL in FY24, while in 4Q, net revenues declined 4% as reported and 2% LFL. Asia Pacific reported net revenue growth in FY24 was supported by double-digit percentage growth in Asia excluding China and the regional Travel Retail channel.In FY24, reported and adjusted gross margin was 64.4%, with each up 50 basis points year-over-year. 4Q24 reported gross margin of 64.2% increased 130 basis points, while adjusted gross margin of 64.2% increased by 140 basis points year-over-year. Coty's FY24 and Q4 reported gross margin improvement was fueled by supply chain savings and the benefit from pricing actions and premiumization, more than offsetting inflationary headwinds.Coty generated reported operating income of $546.7 million in FY24, up 1% year-over-year, with a reported operating margin of 8.9%. Coty's Q4 reported operating income of $34.7 million, with a reported operating margin of 1The following information was filed by Coty Inc.
