Description


Robert Kelly III





          2007-06-30 00:33:36 UTC
        

Using paludis to install cryptsetup-luks, which pulls in libgcrypt as a dependency, I found that the test suite was hanging after giving:
PASS: prime
PASS: register
When I did export SKIP_FUNCTIONS="test", I had no problem installing libgcrypt.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. paludis -i libgcrypt (or cryptsetup-luks)
2. when this hangs, kill it and try export SKIP_FUNCTIONS="test"
3. paludis -i libgcrypt will now work



Expected Results:  
the test suite should have completed successfully

Works for me.
Try to use portage, see if it helps.
Or try to gather more information.

Closing this until you have some more information.
