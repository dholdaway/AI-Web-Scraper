can not really repro ... will try to see if this is python3.8 because repro has been tried with 3.9

did this ever happen again? maybe we can close this and it was just a "hickup" of some sort

I tried hard but can not repro. There is no report for 3.1.7 so i will assume this to go away over time. Would rather make that new stable than invest more.

For now i will just close and keep 3.1.5 as is.
