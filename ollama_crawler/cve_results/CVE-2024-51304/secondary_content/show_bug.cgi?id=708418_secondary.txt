gdb says:
Reading symbols from dd...
Reading symbols from /usr/lib/debug//bin/dd.debug...
(No debugging symbols found in /usr/lib/debug//bin/dd.debug)

I never asked for this.

Okay, it works if i pass -ggdb3 in the flags. I was confused by the fact that lots of software in the tree produce debug symbols unconditionally.
