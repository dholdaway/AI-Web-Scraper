I ran

emerge vmware-player 

after that /opt/vmware/player/bin/vmware-config.pl

got a couple of errors. 

 * Starting VMware services:                                              [ ok ]
 *   Virtual machine monitor                                              [ !! ]

 * Vmware Player is installed, but it has not been (correctly) configured
 * for the running kernel.
 * Please ensure that the modules have been compiled for this kernel:
 * emerge --oneshot vmware-modules
 * Also ensure Vmware Player has been configured:
 * /opt/vmware/player/bin/vmware-config.pl
 * VMware is not properly configured! See above.                          [ !! ]

It already depends on it. You need to re-emerge vmware-modules after kernel upgrade.

this is the first time I install it and it didn't pull in the dep for app-emulation/vmware-modules.

I went into the ebuild file and didn't saw it but now I grep it and saw there is a ~ in front of it, what does that means?
