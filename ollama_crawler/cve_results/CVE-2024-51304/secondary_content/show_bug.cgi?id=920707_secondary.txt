file asked to be uploaded by the live CD

I cannot install Gentoo from the live CD, which I have burned onto a USB stick. I am booted into the rescue shell with the following error:
[!!] init (/sbin/init) not found in mounted root device (UNKNOWN)!

I created my bootable usb with this shell command:
dd if=install-amd64-minimal-20231224T164659Z.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=1M status=progress

Attached are the logs that the live CD asked me to attach to this bug report

Update: I have personally solved this by redownloading the iso and reburning it on a different usb stick.

I am not completely sure if this issue was my fault or a legitimate bug, so I will leave this report's status as unconfirmed for now.
