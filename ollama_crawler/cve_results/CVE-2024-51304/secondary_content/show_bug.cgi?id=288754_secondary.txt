ntp-client can't connect to the ntp server when openrc 0.5.1 and the new new network scripts are used.

The following solution worked for me:
/etc/conf.d/ntpd: change the last line to NTPD_OPTS="-g"
/etc/ntp.conf: add iburst to all lines defining the time servers.
rc-update del ntp-client default

I think these changes should be made the default before openrc goes stable.
Also relevant is that ntpdate is considered deprecated according to it's man page.

Reproducible: Always

Can you go back to the default settings and let me know if this is still an
issue with openrc-0.5.2-r2?

Thanks much,

William

I was unable to reproduce this with the default settings and the most current openrc.

The deprication of ntpdate is definitely something that we should look at, but I think we can use another bug for that.
