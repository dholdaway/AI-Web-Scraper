After the upgrade to tcl/tk-8.6.0 dev-vcs/git doesn't build anymore:
...

    LINK        git-citool -> git-gui

    INSTALL 644 tclIndex

Running "make V=1 lib/tclIndex" in /var/tmp/portage/dev-vcs/git-1.8.1/work/git-1.8.1/git-gui gives:

This is caused by configuring tcl with '--with-encoding=utf-8'.  It seems that this creates a broken tcl install which fails to read its own (internal) configuration:

--with-encoding=<val> sets TCL_CFGVAL_ENCODING=<val>

This is used in tclPkgConfig.c where it is passed to Tcl_RegisterConfig() which uses that encoding to decode the values in the package configuration table.  However, if the encoding is not found it completely skips reading the configuration; silently.  When this configuration isn't read, tcl has no idea where its library is located which causes everything to break.

I have confirmed that removing the '--with-encoding=utf-8' line from tcl-8.6.0.ebuild fixes tcl on my system.

Same problem. Confirmed suggested fix in comment 1 works for me.

Please use tcl-8.6.0-r1.
