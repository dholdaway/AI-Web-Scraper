Hello arches,

libpeas-1.14 introduced lua support and lua JIT. This is controlled by USE="lua" and USE="lua jit"


On alpha and sparc, there is no keywords for ['dev-lua/lgi', '>=dev-lang/luajit-2:2']

On ppc64, there is no keyword for ['>=dev-lang/luajit-2:2'].

For now, I will package.use.mask this. If you are fine with this, you can just un-CC yourself from this bug report, otherwise, please keyword the package.

For now, I have no idea how to test the feature work as I haven't seen any package requiring it yet.

We see no problem on keeping them masked if nothing else start to need it

Looks like remaining arches are ok with the use.mask
