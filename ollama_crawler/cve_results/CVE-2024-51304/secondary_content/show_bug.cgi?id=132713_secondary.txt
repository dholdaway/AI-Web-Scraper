I have a strange problem with rmagick-1.10.1.  When I emerge it, it hangs on the line with (example 113 of 178), ruby takes 100% of the cpu, and it doesn't appear to make any progress (I waited about 10 min).

Has anyone else seen this?  Could it have anything to do with the 1.10 gem already being installed?

If you can still reproduce this, please reopen with emerge info and ps aux status.
