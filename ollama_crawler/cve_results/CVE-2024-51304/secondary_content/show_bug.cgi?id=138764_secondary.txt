Description


Don Colton





          2006-07-01 13:20:35 UTC
        

I upgraded X last night by doing "emerge -uD world" after deleting the old X.  This is my first xinit since then.  I get the error message

"xterm: error while loading shared libraries: libXaw.so.8 cannot open shared object file: no such file or directory".

I can find libXaw.so.7 and .so.6 on my system, but nothing called .so.8

Workaround: rebuild xterm.  But it seems like the rebuild of xterm should have been an automatic thing with -uD world.
