The DNA-binding domain of these proteins is often evolutionarily conserved. On this basis, liver-enriched transcription factors were classified into five families. We describe here the mammalian prototype of a sixth family, which we therefore call hepatocyte nuclear factor 6 (HNF-6).

The DNA-binding domain of these proteins is often evolutionarily conserved. On this basis, liver-enriched transcription factors were classified into five families. We describe here the mammalian prototype of a sixth family, which we therefore call hepatocyte nuclear factor 6 (HNF-6). It activates the promoter of a gene involved in the control of glucose metabolism. HNF-6 contains two different DNA-binding domains. One of these corresponds to a novel type of homeodomain. The other is homologous to the Drosophila cut domain. A similar bipartite sequence is coded by the genome of Caenorhabditis elegans.National Acad SciencesShow moreShow lessSave Cite Cited by 178 Related articles All 12 versions  PrivacyTermsHelpAbout ScholarSearch help
