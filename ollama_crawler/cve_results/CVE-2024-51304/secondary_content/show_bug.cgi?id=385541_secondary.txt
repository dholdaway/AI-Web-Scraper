 *  *  *  *  * /usr/include/bits/stdio2.h:65: warning: call to __builtin___snprintf_chk will always overflow destination buffer

 * Please do not file a Gentoo bug and instead report the above QA
 * issues directly to the upstream developers of this software.
 * Homepage: http://www.freeradius.org/

Expected Results:  
Absence of QA notices

* issues directly to the upstream developers of this software
