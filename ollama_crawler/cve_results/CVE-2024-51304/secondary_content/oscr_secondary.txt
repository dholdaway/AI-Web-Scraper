(“Oscar” or the “Company”) (NYSE: OSCR), a leading healthcare technology company, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.“Oscar reported strong 2023 results with most core metrics exceeding our expectations for the full year. We delivered on our commitment for Insurance Company Adjusted EBITDA profitability and have a clear line of sight into consolidated Adjusted EBITDA profitability in 2024,” said Mark Bertolini, CEO of Oscar. “We are pleased to serve more than 1.3 million members this year and remain focused on driving long-term sustainable margin expansion.”Total Direct and Assumed Policy Premiums for 2023 were $6.6 billion, down 3% year-over-year (“YoY”), driven primarily by lower membership, partially offset by rate increases. Premiums earned of $5.7 billion for the year increased 47% YoY, driven primarily by the impact of deposit accounting for quota share reinsurance agreements, and lower risk transfer per member as a percent of premiums.Oscar’s InsuranceCo Combined Ratio, which is the sum of its Medical Loss Ratio (“MLR”) and the InsuranceCo Administrative Expense Ratio, improved 640 bps YoY to 99.5% for 2023, driven by both an improved MLR and administrative cost efficiencies. Specifically, the MLR improved 370 bps YoY to 81.6%, due to targeted rate increases and a disciplined pricing strategy and total cost of care initiatives. The InsuranceCo Administrative Expense Ratio improved 270 bps YoY to 17.9%, due to lower distribution expenses and higher net premiums as a result of lower risk transfer per member as a percent of premiums.The Adjusted Administrative Expense Ratio for 2023 improved 350 bps YoY to 21.0%, due to lower distribution expenses, higher net premiums as a result of lower risk transfer per member as a percent of premiums, and higher net investment income. The Adjusted EBITDA loss of $45 million improved by $417 million YoY, and decreased as a percentage of premiums before ceded reinsurance by 8 points as compared to the prior year. Net loss of $271 million improved by $339 million YoY and decreased as a percentage of premiums before ceded reinsurance by 7 points compared to the prior year.The Company is introducing its outlook for 2024 including two new metrics, Total Revenue and SG&A Expense Ratio. The Company anticipates Total Revenue of $8.3 billion to $8.4 billion, a Medical Loss Ratio of 80.2% to 81.2%, a SG&A Expense Ratio of 20.5% to 21.0%, and Total Company Adjusted EBITDA of $125 million to $175 million. For more information on these metrics, see the “2024 Outlook and Supplemental Information” on page 3 in this release.1The following information was filed by Oscar Health, Inc. (OSCR) on Wednesday, February 7, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.

 Inside Oscar Health, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Actual risk adjustment calculations and transfers could materially differ from our assumptions.



 Other - Other   Highlight
We regularly assess these estimates; however, actual amounts could differ from those estimates.

 Legal - Other   Highlight
In the individual and small group lines, there is a higher degree of uncertainty associated with estimates of risk transfers at the beginning of the policy year resulting from composition of the risk score being based on concurrent claim data.

 Other - Other   Highlight
An accounting policy is considered to be critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and the effect of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition, or operating performance.
