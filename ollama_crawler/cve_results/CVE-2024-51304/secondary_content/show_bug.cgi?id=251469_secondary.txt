Check the file in the URL, Firefox 3.0.4 in Gentoo fails to render it properly and only shows some rectangles. Firefox 3.0.4 on OSX and Windows work fine. Ubuntu's Firefox reportedly works fine too.

Can you also attach what do you see? Just to be sure, since on ia64 with 3.0.5 it works fine, but on x86 with 3.0.4 it doesn't...

Could you please check with 3.0.5? nightmorph also confirmed it works fine.
