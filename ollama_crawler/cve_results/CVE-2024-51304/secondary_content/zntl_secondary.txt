Exhibit 99.1Zentalis Pharmaceuticals Reports Full Year 2023 Financial Results and Operational Updates Robust azenosertib clinical development plan ongoing and on track with multiple clinical catalysts anticipated, including monotherapy and combination data readouts in gynecological and other cancer types during 2024 Strengthened management team with appointments of Diana Hausman, M.D., as Chief Medical Officer and Kyle Rasbach, Ph.D., Pharm.D., as Chief Business Officer $483 million cash balance as of December 31, 2023, with projected cash runway into 2026NEW YORK and SAN DIEGO — February 27, 2024 — Zentalis® Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ZNTL), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company discovering and developing clinically differentiated small molecule therapeutics targeting fundamental biological pathways of cancers, today announced financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023 , and highlighted recent corporate accomplishments."Zentalis is making remarkable progress in advancing our clinical development program for azenosertib, our potentially groundbreaking WEE1 inhibitor, across various tumor types," stated Kimberly Blackwell, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Zentalis. "In November 2023, we disclosed promising clinical data demonstrating the potential of azenosertib as an effective monotherapy in ovarian cancer and uterine serous carcinoma. Our team is diligently executing a clinical strategy, which is firmly on track, designed to rapidly bring this promising therapeutic option to patients with gynecological cancers that continue to have a poor prognosis based on currently available treatment options. We anticipate an exciting and data-rich period ahead during the remainder of 2024 and into 2025 where we plan to share multiple clinical datasets to help further demonstrate the potential of azenosertib in multiple cancer types as a monotherapy and in combination."Program Updates and Highlights•Azenosertib development program updates. In November 2023, the Company announced an updated analysis of the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of azenosertib as a monotherapy in solid tumors (ZN-c3-001), which continued to show anti-tumor activity with intermittent dosing. In the same population of 19 platinum resistant or refractory ovarian cancer and uterine serous carcinoma (USC) patients that were included in the data reported on June 6, 2023, the objective response rate (ORR) was 37%. Median follow-up had increased and the median progression free survival (mPFS) had increased to 6.5 months. The Company also disclosed in November 2023, that, with additional safety-evaluable patients and follow-up, azenosertib continued to demonstrate a favorable safety and tolerability profile similar to or better than approved ovarian cancer products. •Azenosertib development continues to progress across a broad array of tumor types.  Azenosertib is being evaluated in more than 10 ongoing and planned clinical trials as a monotherapy and in combinations supported by compelling scientific rationales across a broad array of tumor types, including platinum resistant ovarian cancer (PROC), platinum sensitive ovarian cancer (PROC), BRAF mutant metastatic colorectal cancer, and other solid tumors. In addition, the Company is evaluating azenosertib and its BCL-2 inhibitor in patients with relapsed or refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). The following information was filed by Zentalis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ZNTL) on Tuesday, February 27, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.
