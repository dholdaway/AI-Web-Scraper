Description

Two separate websites have a problem with no error messages as/of 3.5.8, problem did not appear in 3.5.7.  Public website is the ibm java page trying to download a java version, gets a site not found error.  Private website is a bank site when trying to make a transfer, eternal wait with no transaction.  Neither website has a problem when using firefox.  No error messages in terminal in either case. 

For the ibm website and link to download file:
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/linux/download.html
https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/iwm/web/preLogin.do?source=swg-sdk6&S_PKG=ipseries32&S_TACT=105AGX05&S_CMP=JDK
The above works in every browser but in konqueror generates the following error message:
An error occurred while loading https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/iwm/web/preLogin.do?source=swg-sdk6&S_PKG=ipseries32&S_TACT=105AGX05&S_CMP=JDK:
Could not connect to host www14.software.ibm.com.

The bank site waits around 5 minutes and then tries to open some randomly named file that doesn't exist.  I believe the two errors are related.

Reproducible: Always

Please try re-emerging kdelibs.

Why?  No effect.

Confirmed, running latest KDE related ebuilds. (kdelibs 3.5.8-r1 & konqueror 3.5.8)
This also occurs on KDE stable, so it is not a regression from 3.5.7-r3
Don't have an earlier version installed to check.

Reproducible: Always

Checking install logs, the last time I updated ibm-jdk-bin occurred after konqueror-3.5.6 and before konqueror-3.5.7.  My memory was incorrect on the version of konqueror that was installed.  The bank site did work with konqueror-3.5.7

Does this still happen for you? I can't reproduce it on the IBM page you mentioned. Works just fine for me in konqueror-3.5.8 using kdelibs-3.5.8-r2.

Still happens.  Has anything changed in the last month?  Most of the effort seems aimed at kde4, not bug fixes.

Works fine for me. The effort goes where it's needed.
