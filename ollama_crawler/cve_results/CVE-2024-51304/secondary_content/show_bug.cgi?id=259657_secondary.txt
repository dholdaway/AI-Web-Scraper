While trying to update app-portage/genlop-0.30.8-r2 I get the following:
Calculating dependencies \ * Digest verification failed:
 * /usr/portage/app-portage/genlop/genlop-0.30.8-r2.ebuild
 * Reason: Failed on RMD160 verification
 * Got: 2c44195b37badaca0ab551705f4ecb7507fc9020
 * Expected: d87a34891bbf70d8758f68af5ebeae5160353871                         ... done!


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.emerge app-portage/genlop
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
app-portage/genlop failed to build with the error:
emerge -avuD world

These are the packages that would be merged, in order:

Calculating dependencies \ * Digest verification failed:
 * /usr/portage/app-portage/genlop/genlop-0.30.8-r2.ebuild
 * Reason: Failed on RMD160 verification

Expected Results:  
app-portage/genlop should have been updated

Looks like it was already fixed -- genlop merged fine for me.
