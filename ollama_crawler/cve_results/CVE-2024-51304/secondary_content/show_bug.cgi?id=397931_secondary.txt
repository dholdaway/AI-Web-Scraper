I created an init script to call luksOpen automatically on encrypted devices. It sucks to have to do it manually after each boot. It optionally supports key files. I attached it to this bug report. Maybe it is useful for someone.

Reproducible: Always

Um, did you see /etc/conf.d/dmcrypt and the dmcrypt init script that are installed by cryptsetup? These do what you implemented and a bit more.

Ah. No, I didn't, thanks :-) And googling for „luks open init gentoo“ didn't, too.

Anyway, that makes this script obsolete, thanks.

That's where our support venues might come in handy. i.e. ask on the Forums or on IRC next time you miss a feature before reimplementing it. It might save you some time.

I'll close this bug as WORKSFORME. Thanks for your contribution. I hope it at least refreshed your shell skills. ;)
