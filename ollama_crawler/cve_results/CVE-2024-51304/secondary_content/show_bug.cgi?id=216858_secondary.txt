emerge eclipse-sdk result in a conflict between these packages.

No overlay added for java or firefox!

Well, you cant have mozilla-firefox and mozilla-firefox-bin

Im a Netbeans user (but most time im not using IDE), but if eclipse-sdk needs mozilla-firefox, you can start thinking in unmerge mozilla-firefox-bin

I fail to see the problem here. SWT needs to build against Gecko and firefox-bin does not provide the files needed to build against Gecko. As such the ebuild must depend on the from sources version that can't be installed at the same time with firefox-bin. Conflicts are an expected situation, not an error.

You can also set xulrunner USE flag for swt and install xulrunner along with firefox-bin...
