Description

After I ask on irc:

I get:

  dependency.bad                22
   app-emulation/qemu/qemu-2.0.0-r1.ebuild: DEPEND: amd64(default/linux/amd64/13.0) ['sys-infiniband/librdmacm', '>=net-fs/libnfs-1.9.3', 'sys-infiniband/librdmacm[static-libs(+)]', '>=net-fs/libnfs-1.9.3[static-libs(+)]']


I'd suggest to stable mask the use, go ahead if you think is fine.
