$ urxvt -pe tabbed -geometry 80x40
opens a terminal with 78 columns (2 columns less) than normal (without -pe tabbed)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
more easy to reproduce:
$ urxvt -pe tabbed -geometry 10x10
in the new term window
$ echo 1234567890

Actual Results:  
12345678
90

Expected Results:  
1234567890

This should be tried with "-geometry 10x10", not "-geometry 80x40"

Or else, simply "echo 12345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890"

I also have this problem when using tabbed terminals (applications complaining about a too small terminal width). Did not look into it further, as I prefer to use screen over a single urxvt for now
