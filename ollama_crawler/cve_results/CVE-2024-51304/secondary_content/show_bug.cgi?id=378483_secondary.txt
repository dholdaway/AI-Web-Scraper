Description

xen-4.1.1 & xen-tools 4.1.1 emerge readily.
On booting into the xen 4.1.1 hypervisor, attempting to boot a vm stop at seeking /dev/root on booting the vm.

Selecting a shell, ls /dev reveals absence of any /dev/xvd

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge xen-4.1.1
2. Boot into dom0
3. Attempt to start a vm.


Expected Results:  
To make the required frontend xen devices

This is found to occur with both a kernel 2.6.38 xen gentoo kernel and a kernel-3.0.0 compiled as a capable dom0.  No changes to the kernels.  

Selecting the xen-4.1.0.gz hypervisor results in effective booting of the vms.
