media-libs/esdl-1.0.1 (although a lot of errors and warnings are displayed) compiles successfully, but then fails to install with this line:

cp: cannot stat `priv/*.*': No such file or directory

The complete log + 'emerge --info' output will be attached.

Reproducible: Always

Patch to fix the Makefile

This patch fixes the Makefile by sed-ing out the lines causing trouble.
As the 'priv' subdirectory installed by these lines is empty anyways it shouldn't cause any further trouble.

cp priv/*.* /var/tmp/portage/media-libs/esdl-1.0.1/image///usr/lib/erlang/lib/esdl-1.0.1/priv
chmod 755 /var/tmp/portage/media-libs/esdl-1.0.1/image///usr/lib/erlang/lib/esdl-1.0.1/priv/*
>>> Completed installing esdl-1.0.1 into /var/tmp/portage/media-libs/esdl-1.0.1/image/

this works here, in the priv directory, I have sdl_driver.so file, so it doesn't fail here. it works to build with all USE-flags enabled and disabled, not sure what goes wrong on your box...

Can't reproduce this bug here anymore.
So I have no clue what has actually caused this.

Marking this bug as WORKSFORME.
