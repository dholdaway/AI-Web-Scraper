FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE         Financial Information Press Contact:  Vincent C. Klinges   Chief Financial Officer    American Software, Inc.  (404) 264-5477 American Software Reports Fourth Quarter  and Fiscal Year 2024 Results   Transformative Actions Taken in Fiscal 2024  Subscription Fee Growth of 8% and 10% in Q4 and Fiscal 2024  ATLANTA (June 6, 2024) American Software, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMSWA) today reported preliminary  financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024,  we divested our non-core information technology staffing firm, The Proven Method and its results are  included in discontinuing operations.   “Fiscal 2024 was a pivotal year for our company, as we divested several non-core assets, introduced  next-generation AI-first supply chain planning solutions, and reached a definitive agreement to eliminate  our dual class structure,” said Allan Dow, CEO and President of American Software. “As we enter fiscal  2025, our pipeline has expanded meaningfully, thanks in part to increasing client interest in cloud  conversions to realize the benefits of our new AI capabilities. Although we expect the rising demand for our  solutions to accelerate subscription fee growth, our fiscal 2025 guidance assumes that ongoing  macroeconomic headwinds will continue to weigh on customer spending decisions in the near-term.”  Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Outlook from Continuing Operations:  • Total revenues of $104.0 million to $108.0 million, including total recurring revenues of $87.0 million to $89.0 million. • Adjusted EBITDA of $15.0 million to $16.4 million. Key Fourth Quarter Financial Highlights from Continuing Operations:  • Subscription fees were $14.1 million for the quarter ended April 30, 2024, an 8% increase compared to $13.0 million for the same period last year. • Total revenues for the quarter ended April 30, 2024 decreased 5% to $25.4 million, compared to $26.8 million for the same period of the prior year, principally due to a decline in license fee, services and maintenance fee revenue. 
The following information was filed by American Software Inc (AMSWA) on Thursday, June 6, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.
