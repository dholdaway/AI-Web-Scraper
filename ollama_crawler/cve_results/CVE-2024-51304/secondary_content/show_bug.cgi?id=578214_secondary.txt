Hi,
when I try to update my nvidia-drivers package, the emerge process dead prematurely due to a timeout downloading nvidia-settings.tar.bz2 from the official nvidia mirrors...

I need to manually download it from http://ftp.icm.edu.pl/packages/linux-nvidia/nvidia-settings/ and to move it to the /usr/portage/distfiles/ folder before starting the emerge of the nvidia-drivers package...

Best regards

Dr. Iade Gesso (MSc & PhD in Computer Science)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Just run emerge nvidia-drivers

Hello Iade, which version(s) have you tried? I just tried 340.58 and it works ok from the ftp. Are you sure ftp is not blocked on your side?

The problem started with the 346.96-r1 version of the package... and I completely sure that the ftp protocol fully works on my side, since I use it every day for work. The problem is only with the nvidia ftp folder in which nvidia-settings-*.tar.bz2 files are stored.

By checking the SRC_URI a download link looks like the following (and it downloads ok for me):
