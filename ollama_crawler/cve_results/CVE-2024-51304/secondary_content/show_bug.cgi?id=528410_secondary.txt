typing mkpart primary ext2 1 3, as i'm following the instructions, parted creates a partition ext4 with the name 'primary', so it just names the partition instead of assigning a partition type, i'll use gdisk, or both or .  I wasn't sure to report this to you or parted peeps, i haven't used parted before, i've used fdisk so i don't know whether it behaves like this on other distros.  using just mkpart it asks for name, if just mkpart primary it doesn't ask name assumes primary is the name, and still ext4 shows instead of ext2

ah, never mind, there is no primary partitions in gpt, well there's still the misleading instructions in the install guide and gdisk itself, so delete this post

Since 3.0 parted no longer creates filesystems.

* Noteworthy changes in release 3.0 (2011-05-30) [stable]

[...]

** Changes in behavior

  Remove all FS-related (file system-related) sub-commands; these commands
  are no longer recognized because they were all dependent on parted "knowing"
  too much about file system: mkpartfs, mkfs, cp, move, check, resize.
  This change removes not just the user interface bits, but also the
  library functions and nearly all of the underlying FS-munging code.
  The code embedded in Parted by which it knew about those file systems
  was so old, unmaintainable and buggy that while seemingly drastic,
  this change is like removing a gangrenous toe.

We do keep 2.4 in the tree which does what you might have been looking for.
