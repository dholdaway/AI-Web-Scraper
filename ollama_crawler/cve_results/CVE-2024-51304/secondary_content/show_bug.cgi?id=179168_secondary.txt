Description


Sylvain Raybaud

"emerge -av kdenlive" failed during linking phase, because it couldn't find libmlt.so.0.2.2 ; just to see, I symlinked the existing libmlt.so.0.2.3 to libmlt.so.0.2.2 and re-emerged kdenlive, and then it failed at the same stage because it could find libmiracle.so.0.2.2 (also a prior installation of kdenlive wouldn't start becaused it missed this very library). I applied the same trick (I know this is no fix, only a way to see what's wrong), and then kdenlive started and emerged just fine.

Reproducible: Always

Not maintained by the KDE team. Please leave it to bug wranglers to assign bugs.

First of all: Do you still have confcache installed? Please remove it. It's broken.

I can't reproduce this problem using your USE flags. Please try running revdep-rebuild (from app-portage/gentoolkit) and afterwards re-emerge kdenlive.

If neither of the above actions help, please post the output of "emerge kdenlive -pv".

I don't.

Okay, it fixed the library problem (this one, and many other ;) )

thanks a lot, and sorry for making a fuss about nothing.

However now kdenlive compiles just fine, but crashes whenever I try to create a new project or click on the workspace monitor ; but I guess I will open a new bug for this one (except if you think the two are related in some way ?).

No matter if your reuse this bug or open a new one, please make sure to have a look at http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/qa/backtraces.xml to be able to provide a meaningful backtrace. Getting strace output isn't bad either.
