Description

          2012-12-29 10:15:36 UTC
        

sys-devel/llvm-3.2 (and also sys-devel/llvm-9999) fail to compile with the following error:

pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: docutils>=0.7

I do have dev-python/docutils-0.8.1 installed (the version marked as stable in the portage tree).


Reproducible: Always

Now it seems to work again.

docutils was problematic for some people in the past, I guess it is still true (though the error looks different). Thanks for the report, and glad that it now works for you!
