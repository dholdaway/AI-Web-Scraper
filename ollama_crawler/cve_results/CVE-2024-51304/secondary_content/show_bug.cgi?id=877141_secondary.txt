emerge --info

After updating to version 5.1.1, I started observing graphical glitches on the brush cursor and on reference images. They only appear when OpenGL acceleration is enabled. I tried running RenderDoc on it, but it also gave me an error.

Hardware: Ryzen 3800x, Radeon RX 6700xt (on Mesa 22.1.7)

Please try with latest ~arch mesa, I guess?

After upgrading to Mesa 22.2.1, the issues seem to be gone.
