There is a problem with libsigc++-2 in ardour which includes an empty file (maybe due to a API change in libsigc++). I attach a patch that solves the problem by including the correct file.

Reproducible: Always

which version of libsigc++ are you using ?

Here I have:
/usr/include/sigc++-2.0/sigc++/slot.h
with dev-libs/libsigc++-2.2.2

and ardour compiles fine.
Can you paste an error ?
