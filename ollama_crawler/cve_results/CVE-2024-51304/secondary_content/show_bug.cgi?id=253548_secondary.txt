Description

I am working on an ebuild for drm (digital radio mondiale) which needs QWT-4.

As x11-libs/qwt is slotted it is no problem to install both qwt-5 as well as qwt-4. But after the last change to qwt-4.2.0-r3 the symlink for libqwt.so to libqwt.so.4.2.0 gets dropped because of file collission with the new qwt-5 (see Bug 199232). As there is no .so file for qwt-4 anymore no apps can link to that lib.

I would suggest to readd a .so symlink for qwt-4 - maybe as libqwt-4.so. With an according patch for the apps Makefile we can then link to -lqwt-4 again.

Solved the problem with a patch to link to -l:libqwt.so.4 in configure.in

So no need to fix the ebuild. Thanks anyway.
