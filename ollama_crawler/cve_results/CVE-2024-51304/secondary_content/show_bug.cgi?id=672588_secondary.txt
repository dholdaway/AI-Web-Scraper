Description

Sort of similar to 562772 and 624956 but these ebuilds are in the overlay, and all seem to fail not because of the strong signing issue, but with an error about not finding exbuild.  exbuild is a function in the xbuild eclass in the overlay, and that eclass IS inherited in the ebuilds.

The actual failure line is:
/usr/portage/tmpdir/portage/dev-dotnet/xdt-for-monodevelop-2.8.3-r1/temp/environment: line 2207: exbuild: command not found

but the ebuild doesn't actually die until install phase, when it can't find one of the dll's it wants to install into the gac.

So two questions - why doesn't the ebuild fail if it can't find that function, and why can't it find the function?

I'll attach one of the logs for the error(s) in context.

I can now install at least one version of this from the overlay with no errors or apparent problems, so I'm going to close this as WORKSFORME (I don't see NOTABUG on the list.)  Feel free to change to FIXED if there was actually some explicit change made that I didn't notice.
