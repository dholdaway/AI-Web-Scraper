Hey there, when I try to compile kde-base/kdepim-runtime-4.8.0 it fails with the following error:

[ 24%] Building CXX object resources/kcal/CMakeFiles/akonadi_kcal_resource.dir/kcalresource.o

I've attached the complete build.log and the output of emerge --info =kde-base/kdepim-runtime-4.8.0 I'd really appreciate any help on fixing this issue.

kde-base/kdelibs (/usr/include/klocalizedstring.h)

This it seems is your 'offending' header; a core kdelib header file

maybe you he hit a race condition.  

Cannot replicate
