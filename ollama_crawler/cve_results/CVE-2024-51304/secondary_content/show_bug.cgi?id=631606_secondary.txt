Per http://bugs.openmw.org/issues/3808, games-engines/openmw does not support development versions of openscenegraph, and the 3.5.x series has transparency-rendering issues.

The old version in Portage, 3.4.0, doesn't build with recent versions of ffmpeg.  3.4.1, however, does.

Is this still an issue with current openmw?

Yes.  OpenMW still doesn't support development versions of OSG, and the transparency-rendering issue is still there.

Did you test with OSG-3.5.5?

OSG 3.5.5 fixes the specific graphical bug mentioned in the initial report, but it's also an unstable version, and not supported by OpenMW (see, for example, the comments to https://bugs.openmw.org/issues/4302).

(OSG 3.5.6, incidentally, introduces a hitbox bug: https://bugs.openmw.org/issues/3989)

If it works, we don't have a reason to re-introduce an old version of OSG that brings its own issues back with it.

File a new bug in case of issues with this current version of 3.5.5, otherwise we will see to stabilise it asap.
