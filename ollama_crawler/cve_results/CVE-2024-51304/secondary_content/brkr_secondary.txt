BILLERICA, Massachusetts – February 13, 2024 – Bruker Corporation (Nasdaq: BRKR) today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and for the full year ended December 31, 2023.
 
Bruker’s President and CEO Frank Laukien commented: “Bruker’s transformation into a fast-growth company is on track after three consecutive years of double-digit organic revenue growth. Remarkably, in 2023 our industry-leading 14.5% organic revenue growth included double-digit growth from each of our four groups. For the full year 2023, we also delivered 10.3% non-GAAP EPS growth, while investing significantly in R&D, capacity and productivity. This shows the resiliency of our innovation model and exemplifies our focus on disciplined entrepreneurialism.” 
 
Dr. Laukien continued: “Demand for our innovative and differentiated products and solutions has remained solid, as Bruker emerges as a leader in the post-genomic era – a powerful new secular growth trend. For fiscal year 2024, we again expect to achieve well above-market organic revenue and non-GAAP EPS growth.”
Fourth Quarter (Q4) 2023 Financial Results
 
Bruker’s revenues for Q4 2023 were $854.5 million, an increase of 20.6% compared to $708.4 million in Q4 2022. In Q4 2023, revenues increased 15.9% organically yoy. Growth from acquisitions was 2.7%, while foreign currency translation had a positive effect of 2.0%. 
 
Q4 2023 Bruker Scientific Instruments (BSI) revenues of $783.6 million increased 20.2% yoy, with organic revenue growth of 15.5%. Q4 2023 Bruker Energy & Supercon Technologies (BEST) revenues of $75.2 million increased 27.7% yoy, with organic revenue growth, net of intercompany eliminations, of 20.3%.
 
Q4 2023 GAAP operating income was $103.5 million, compared to $131.0 million in Q4 2022. Non-GAAP operating income was $154.5 million in Q4 2023, compared to $148.9 million in Q4 2022. Bruker’s Q4 2023 non-GAAP operating margin was 18.1%, a decrease of ~ 290 basis points from 21.0% in Q4 2022. Q4 2023 pro forma non-GAAP operating margin excluding the PhenomeX acquisition was 20.6%.
 
Q4 2023 GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) were $1.41, compared to $0.66 in Q4 2022. Q4 2023 GAAP EPS included a $0.99 per share gain on the PhenomeX acquisition1. Q4 2023 non-GAAP diluted EPS were 
[1] In Q4 2023, Bruker recorded a GAAP gain of $144.1 million, or $0.99 per share, in connection with the PhenomeX acquisition, which closed on October 2, 2023.
