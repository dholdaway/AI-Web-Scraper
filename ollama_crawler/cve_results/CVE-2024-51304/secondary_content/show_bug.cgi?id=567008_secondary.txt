Which revision of app-text/xmlto is installed?

(In reply to Michael Palimaka (kensington) from comment #1)
> Which revision of app-text/xmlto is installed?
0.0.28-r1
On this computer, xmlto-0.0.28-r1 is installed, but w3m is not installed (links is installed, and it satisfies the || dependency); if I try to re-emerge xmlto, portage does not want to emerge w3m. And xdg-utils fail. On another Gentoo box, when I emerge xmlto-0.0.28-r1, it also installes w3m, and after this xdg-utils emerges fine. Maybe, links is not a good candidate in this || dependency?

After re-emerging xmlto, the problem disappeared. Closing.
