>>> Completed installing ntfsprogs-1.12.1 into /var/tmp/portage/ntfsprogs-1.12.1/image/

--- /usr/

!!! Cannot write to '/usr/include/ntfs'.
!!! Please check permissions and directories for broken symlinks.
!!! You may start the merge process again by using ebuild:
!!! ebuild /usr/portage/sys-fs/ntfsprogs/ntfsprogs-1.12.1.ebuild merge
!!! And finish by running this: env-update

The symlink stems definitely from a previous ebuild, but look at the date... I removed the directory in /opt lately. Close as won't, if you don't want to do anything about it, I just thought it's better to have it reported.

dont know why the date matters ... but neither 1.11.2 or 1.12.1 refer to /opt at all ...

The /opt installation path and the symlink is obviously from a very old ntfsprogs version and the follwing ebuilds never failed, because I never removed /opt/linux-ntfs.
