media-tv/v4l-dvb-hg/v4l-dvb-hg-0.1-r2.ebuild allows local patches.  missing *
in for loop
-        for LOCALPATCH in ${DVB_LOCAL_PATCHES}/;
+       for LOCALPATCH in ${DVB_LOCAL_PATCHES}/*;



Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
no local patches includes

Expected Results:  
local patches included

Well, it works the way it is now:
You specify the patches in DVB_LOCAL_PATCHES, but not the directory.
For now I think it is ok, but we could convert this to DVB_LOCAL_PATCHES_DIR like it is for vdr-ebuild.

I have something like this in my make.conf:
DVB_LOCAL_PATCHES="/usr/src/vdr/dvb-patches/*.diff"
