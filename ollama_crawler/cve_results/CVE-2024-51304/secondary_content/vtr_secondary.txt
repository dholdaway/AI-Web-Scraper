 Ventas Reports 2023 Full Year Results and Provides 2024 Outlook 


CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 14, 2024--Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) (“Ventas” or the “Company”) today reported results for the full year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023. 
 CEO Remarks 
 “Ventas delivered strong growth in the fourth quarter and full year 2023, fueled by property performance. We are pleased to have achieved consecutive years of significant organic growth in our senior housing operating portfolio (“SHOP”), led
            by our U.S. communities and complemented by compounding contributions from our Outpatient Medical & Research portfolio,” said Debra A. Cafaro, Ventas Chairman and CEO. 
 “We expect unprecedented demand for senior housing in 2024 and subsequent years because of the rapidly growing senior population and the value our communities provide to residents and their families. We are focused on leveraging our
            differentiated platform to drive continued organic SHOP performance and investing in senior housing to expand our participation in the compelling multiyear growth opportunity that is underway. 
 “Accelerating demographic demand is driving advantaged growth from our portfolio. We are optimistic about the future and committed to delivering continued strong performance and value for shareholders while enabling exceptional environments
            that benefit the large and growing aging population,” Cafaro concluded.

 Inside Ventas Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
However, from time to time, we may fund the capital expenditures for our triple-net leased properties through loans or advances to the tenants, which may increase the amount of rent payable with respect to the properties in certain cases.



 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
If interest rates have risen at the time we seek to refinance our fixed rate debt, whether at maturity or otherwise, our future earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional borrowing costs.

 Other - Other   Highlight
However, an inability to access liquidity through multiple capital sources concurrently could have a material adverse effect on us.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
However, since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors deem presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves.

 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
Asset/liability management, a key element of enterprise risk management, is designed to support the achievement of our business strategy, while ensuring that we maintain appropriate and tolerable levels of market risk (primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk) and credit risk.
