 Inside Azek Co Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Profit Margin, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin We define Adjusted Gross Profit as gross profit before depreciation and amortization, business transformation costs, acquisition costs and certain other costs as described below.



 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
Our management also uses Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Profit Margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin in conjunction with other GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, including as a measure of our core operating results and the effectiveness of our business strategy, and in evaluating our financial performance.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
While raw material prices have declined during fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2022, and even though we seek to mitigate the effects of increases in raw material costs by broadening our supplier base, increasing our use of recycled material and scrap, reducing waste and exploring options for material substitution without sacrificing quality, raw material prices and shortages of raw materials similar to what we experienced in fiscal year 2022 may reemerge from time to time.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
We define Segment Adjusted EBITDA as a segments net income (loss) before income tax (benefit) expense and by adding to or subtracting therefrom interest expense, net, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation costs, asset impairment and inventory revaluation costs, business transformation costs, capital structure transaction costs, acquisition costs, initial public offering costs and certain other costs.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
The decrease was attributable to lower net sales in our Vycom and Scranton Products businesses as some of our channel partners met demand partially through inventory drawdowns which negatively impacted net sales.
