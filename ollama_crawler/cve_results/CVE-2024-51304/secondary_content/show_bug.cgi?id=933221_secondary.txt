https://www.gentoo.org/support/news-items/2022-07-29-pipewire-sound-server.html

If you enable sound-server in step 1, at some point after startup, videos on YouTube and other sites will no longer play and the sound will stop.

Once this happens, the condition will generally continue until you restart your PC.
Switching sound devices may temporarily resolve the problem.

Reproducible: Always

I think this is probably better as a support topic on the forums, IRC, or the gentoo-user ML.

Feel free to reopen if it turns out there's an issue with the packaging.
