Can we stabilize a newer rspamd?
Needed for glibc-2.34

Well, I was hesitant to propose stabilization because of #810337, which affects both 3.0 and 3.1, and #830624. Both issues are somehow addressed, therefore we probably can stabilize it. Anyway, I don't understand why >=rspamd-3.0 blocks glibc-2.34, the issue #811318 is related only to >=rspamd-3.0, because older versions (rspamd-2.7 in our case) don't use doctest and should probably work with glibc-2.34 as they are.
