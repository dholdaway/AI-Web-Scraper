Will check distfiles before building. Please do so too.

Details at:

The reason for the warning is that the site hosts malicious script content, which was most probably injected via some SQL injection vulnerability on the site. That will not compromise the security of the code we ship, as the distfiles are checked against a manifest, even if downloaded from snes9x.com.

However, maintainers should be cautious about code releases published on the site. I'm putting games@gentoo.org in cc and closing this bug since there is nothing more for us to do (except contact the site owners, which I just did).
