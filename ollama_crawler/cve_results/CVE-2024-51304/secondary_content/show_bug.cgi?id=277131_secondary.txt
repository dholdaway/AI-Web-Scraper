Webgrind is an Xdebug profiling web frontend in PHP5. It implements a subset of the features of kcachegrind and installs in seconds and works on all platforms. For quick'n'dirty optimizations it does the job. Here's a screenshot showing the output from profiling:

Reproducible: Always




Should be simple to do, don't know about Gentoo's webapp thing. I think it should have a dependency on xdebug because it takes the dir information out of xdebug's php.ini settings.
