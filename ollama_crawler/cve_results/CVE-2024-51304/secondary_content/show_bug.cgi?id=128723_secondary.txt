Description

Hi, 

I've been unable to install K3B on my system for some time and always get the error:

!!! Digest verification Failed:
!!!    /usr/portage/distfiles/k3b-0.12.14.tar.bz2
!!! Reason: Failed on MD5 verification

For the past few days, I sync portage and remove my distfiles by doing
#rm /usr/portage/distfiles/k3b-*
(to ensure I get fresh downloads) but to no avail. It seems the md5sum may be wrong in the ebuild itself.

For info, after an emerge --sync this morning, here are the content of some files on my system:
/usr/portage/app-cdr/k3b/files/digest-k3b-0.12.14
MD5 51ef4fdf98365a285489dc1e11a07a3c k3b-0.12.14.tar.bz2 4096391
MD5 43ab7d8f601b24e378991559f51a1a41 k3b-i18n-0.12.14.tar.bz2 4744451

Based on the files freshly downloaded, file sizes match:
#cd /usr/portage/distfiles/
#ls -al k3b*
-rw-rw-r--  1 root portage 4096391 Mar  8 05:33 k3b-0.12.14.tar.bz2
-rw-rw-r--  1 root portage 4744451 Mar  8 05:35 k3b-i18n-0.12.14.tar.bz2

but md5sums do not:
#md5sum k3b*
07f45ef35ae57568f5721878a4e030ec  k3b-0.12.14.tar.bz2
04bf4bee1ff67458ccab31bbfcf203a1  k3b-i18n-0.12.14.tar.bz2

Are the checksums in the ebuild wrong or are the files corrupted?

I just did some extra bits of testing: the bz2 files on my disk are corrupted and cannot be uncompressed. It looks that either the downloads went wrong or the files are corrupted on the mirrors. Considering I've been downloading the files several times via emerge, it looks like the files on the mirrors may be corrupted.

I went to download manually the files from the k3b download page (http://k3b.plainblack.com/download) and these are correct. I can now emerge successfully.

Works fine here. Reopen if you can identify the broken mirror, not much we could do otherwise...
