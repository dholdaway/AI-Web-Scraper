While emerging games-arcade/performous-1.0, the build fails during the installation with the following output:

[...]
Install the project...
/usr/bin/cmake -P cmake_install.cmake
-- Install configuration: "Gentoo"
CMake Error at lang/cmake_install.cmake:36 (file):
  file INSTALL cannot find
  "/var/tmp/portage/games-arcade/performous-1.0/work/performous-1.0_build/lang/de.mo".
Call Stack (most recent call first):

Makefile:96: recipe for target 'install' failed
make: *** [install] Error 1

[...]

In the build dir is no /var/tmp/portage/games-arcade/performous-1.0/work/performous-1.0_build/lang/de.mo but a /var/tmp/portage/games-arcade/performous-1.0/work/performous-1.0_build/lang/de/LC_MESSAGES/Performous.mo
