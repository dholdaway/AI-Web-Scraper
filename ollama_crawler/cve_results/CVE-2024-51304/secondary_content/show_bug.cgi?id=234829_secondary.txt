When I try to emerge gtkhtml-3.18.2, I get a digest verification failure:
These are the packages that would be merged, in order:

"Calculating dependencies... done!
[ebuild  NS   ] net-libs/libsoup-2.4.1  USE="ssl -debug -doc" 614 kB 
[ebuild  N    ] gnome-extra/gtkhtml-3.18.2  USE="-debug -static" 1,284 kB 

Total: 2 packages (1 new, 1 in new slot), Size of downloads: 1,897 kB

Would you like to merge these packages? [Yes/No] y
>>> Verifying ebuild Manifests...

!!! Digest verification failed:
!!! /usr/portage/gnome-extra/gtkhtml/files/gtkhtml-3.2-gi18n.patch
!!! Reason: Failed on RMD160 verification
!!! Got: 93cd5e7a7bb593c2e89c3e171d75bbb1ff564725
!!! Expected: 7685c7b603d425f47b9d3c4ef89fea7c389048a8"

Which is quite annoying since gnome 2.22 apparently became stable and since I had to unmerge blocking ebuilds, I'm left without a desktop...


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.emerge gtkhtml -av
2.
3.

Somehow deleting the directory /usr/portage/gnome-extra/gtkhtml/ and resyncing helped things out. I don't understand why, rsync didn't kick out the corrupted files by itself?

maybe a mirror was in a limbo state.
