Description

Hi,

Attached is a new ebuild for JRTPLIB. From the homepage:

The library offers support for the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP), defined
in RFC 3550. It makes it very easy to send and receive RTP packets and the RTCP
(RTP Control Protocol) functions are handled entirely internally.

I suggest this to be placed in net-libs/jrtplib

I introduced a new USE-flag (jthread) for another new package, JThread, for
which the ebuild is in bug 106976. JThread isn't needed by JRTPLIB to compile,
it only adds more functionality.

The ebuild header is missing, see
