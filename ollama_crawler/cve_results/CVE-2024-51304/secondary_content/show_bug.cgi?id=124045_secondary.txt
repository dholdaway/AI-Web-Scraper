Having emerged pax-utils-0.1.10 with libcap <1.10-r5 installed results in a failed build due to several undefined references while linking with libcap. This required version has to be added to the ebuild in portage.

Eh? 1.10-r5 is the only version in portage.

I guess this was not always the case, since I had a libcap-1.10-r4 installed - apparently not updated for a while. Well, if this 'bug' only applies to me, you can close it.
