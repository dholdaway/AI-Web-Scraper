Description

Since gtk-engines-xfce-3.0.0-rN00 supports both GTK+ 2 (-r200, pulled in by default) and GTK+ 3 (-r300, not pulled in by default), wouldn't it make sense to update the xfce-base/xfce-meta-4.10 ebuild to depend on the -r300 version if the user has gtk3 in his USE flags?

I just updated the gentoo wiki with instructions on how to manually enable gtk-engines-xfce GTK+ 3 support in the absence of this convenient feature.

See http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Xfce#Native_Xfce_theme_engine

If xfce-base/xfce4-meta, or x11-themes/gtk-engines-xfce is part of the world, and you do a upgrade with --deep, like emerge -avDNut world, the :3 SLOT gets pulled in already

And that is how I want to keep it
