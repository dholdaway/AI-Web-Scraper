build.log of the failing emerge

When rebuilding dev-util/oprofile-1.4.0 I'm getting a configuration error saying `configure: error: liberty library not found`

I'm using LTO overlay, but I think this problem is not affected by it.

Ok, so after looking at this file (thanks for the hint :) ) I've noticed that the problem actually is caused by LTO (different GCC version between dev-util/oprofile and sys-libs/binutils-libs). I fixed it by rebuilding binutils-libs.
