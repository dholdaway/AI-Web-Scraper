Description

The user has installed Gentoo from scratch using the 2005.1 Universal CD. The
system is now compiled using:
ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~x86"
in /etc/make.conf

After installing Gnome via the command:
emerge gnome -atv
the user cannot add the volume applet on a panel.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Gnome 2.12 after a fresh Gentoo installation: emerge gnome
2.Right-click on a panel and select: Add to Panel...
Actual Results:  
Volume applet is not available for the user.

Expected Results:  
Volume applet should be available in the "Add to Panel" window.

Please see bug 111295. The user understands that gstreamer is now needed for
Gnome 2.12 to build, however was the gstreamer USE flag responsible for
installing the volume applet? If so, when users upgrade to Gnome 2.12 when
marked stable, would they not lose the applet in question?

Please indicate how the user may install the volume applet if you determine this
bug to be invalid.

You can't add the volume applet unless your sound card is enabled. Is alsa set
up correctly for the sound card?

Yes, I can hear Gnome event sounds, music and videos fine.

I have just re-emerged gnome-applets for the third time, restarted the pc and
noticed that the Volume applet is now available!

Any ideas why this would happen after a fresh install?
