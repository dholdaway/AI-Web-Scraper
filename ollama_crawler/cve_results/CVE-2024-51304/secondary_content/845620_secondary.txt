Multiple RSA implementations fail to properly handle signatures	




Vulnerability Note VU#845620
Original Release Date: 2006-09-11 | Last Revised: 2007-02-08
































 












Overview

 Multiple RSA implementations fail to properly handle RSA signatures. This vulnerability may allow an attacker to forge RSA signatures.

Description
RSA signatures are used to authenticate the source of a message. To prevent RSA signatures from being forged, messages are padded with data to ensure message hashes are adequately sized. One such padding scheme is specified in the Public-Key Cryptography Standard #1 (PKCS-1), which is defined in RFC 3447. Many RSA implementations may fail to properly verify signatures. Specifically, the verifier may incorrectly parse PKCS-1 padded signatures, ignoring data at the end of a signature. If this data is ignored and a RSA key with a public exponent of three is used, it may be possible to forge the signing key's signature.Note that any application that uses RSA signatures may be affected by this vulnerability. This includes, but is not limited to, SSH, SSL, PGP, and X.509 applications. This issue is further discussed on the ietf-openpgp mailing list.
Impact
 This vulnerability may allow an attacker to forge an RSA signature.

Vendor Statement
F-Secure antivirus products are not vulnerable. The list of non-vulnerable products includes F-Secure Anti-Virus, F-Secure Internet Security, F-Secure Client Security, F-Secure Server Security, F-Secure Mobile Security, F-Secure Messaging Security Gateway, F-Secure Network Control, and all other products in F-Secure small business and corporate suites, also listed at http://www.f-secure.com/enterprises/products/.F-Secure VPN+ versions up to version 6.12 are vulnerable in installations that use PKI CA issued certificates, which use third-party generated keys. The RSA key generator in F-Secure products has never allowed the generation of RSA keys with a public exponent of 3. This means that keys created with F-Secure tools cannot be used to mount an attack against F-Secure products or other systems.The F-Secure SSH product line is exclusively distributed by Attachmate under the Reflection for Secure IT brand. Please see the vendor statement from Attachmate for more information.

Not Affected




	  
	  Notified:  September 08, 2006  Updated: September 11, 2006
            
	  

Status
Not Affected 
Vendor Statement
I do not believe that any program in the PuTTY suite is, or has ever been, vulnerable to this attack.The RSA verification code is in the function rsa2_verifysig() in our source file sshrsa.c, and a quick inspection shows clearly that it rigorously enforces that the ASN.1 data and hash value must be at the very bottom of the PKCS#1 padded integer.For good measure, our RSA key generator does not, and has never, generated keys with an exponent of 3. (This has nothing to do with whether we're vulnerable to the attack itself, of course, but it does mean we are also not generating keys which can be abused to mount the attack against other systems.)

Vendor Statement
Although cryptlib shouldn't be vulnerable to the original Bleichenbacher attack, there is ongoing discussion about further attacks that affect any RSA keys with e=3.  Because the security community currently doesn't know how serious the problem is, cryptlib users should disable the use of any RSA keys with e=3 by changing the check 'if( BN_get_word( e ) < 3 )' in initCheckRSAkey() in context/kg_rsa.c to 'if( BN_get_word( e ) < 17 )'.  Note that this will disable the use of a small number of existing keys that use e=3 (although cryptlib itself will never generate or use private keys with thisvalue), but until the exact nature of the problem is fully understood this is the only safe fix.
