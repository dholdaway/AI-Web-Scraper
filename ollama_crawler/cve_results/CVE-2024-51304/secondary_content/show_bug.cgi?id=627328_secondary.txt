I was also getting a similar error with version 2.0.8.

I found a work-around here:

https://github.com/lxc/lxc/issues/1555#issuecomment-301254419

Upstream seems to indicate we are installing newuidmap and newgidmap with incorrect permissions.

Lxc 2.0.8 works fine after I run:

sudo chmod 04755 /usr/bin/newuidmap
sudo chmod 04755 /usr/bin/newgidmap

Do you still have the same problems in newer LXC versions? Things have been working fine here and newuidmap/newgidmap have 4711 perms on my system.
