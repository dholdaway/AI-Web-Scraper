After emerging KBFX, it does not show up in the "add applet" menu.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.emerge kbfx
2.in KDE right-click on the panel
3.select "add applet to panel"

Actual Results:  
KBFX Spinx is not listed

Expected Results:  
KBFX Spinx is listed

The fix is very simple:
# dcop --all-users kicker default restart

This could be added to the end of the ebuild.

I have the same exact problem here, but using the suggested fix does NOT work for me. Instead, I had to copy libkbfxspinx.* into /usr/kde/3.5/lib/kde3 from /usr/lib and /usr/share/apps/kicker/applets/kbfxspinx.desktop to /usr/kde/3.5/share/apps/kicker/applets. Even when doing this, the menu does not have the scroll up/dn images on it.

Can't reproduce.

Since when is one allowed to close a bug simply because it works for that person? The point of a bug is that there is some unexpected condition causing it. Just because you are not encountering this condition does not mean that others aren't. This is rather ridiculous.

Glad to hear it works for one/some/most system(s). I wonder why I needed to poke dcop? I haven't made it a priority (aka I don't have time) to dig into how applets, kicker, and dcop interact, however I'd be happy to work with someone who has to actually resolve this. 

Also, why is kbfxspinx.desktop so special as to where it's .desktop file gets installed? On your working system, where is 'kbfspinx.desktop'?

I'm not convinced this bug is resolved, however I recognize the limited resources and desire to close bugs, so am opting to leave it resolved FOR NOW. 

Should anyone else experience a similar issue, PLEASE REOPEN THIS BUG.

I have the same issue - the .desktop file gets placed into /usr/share/apps/kicker/applets instead of /usr/kde/3.5/...

So this bug seems to be resolved for me with the latest kbfx e-build (0.4.9.3.1-r1) since it installs into /usr/kde/3.5/ instead of /usr/.
