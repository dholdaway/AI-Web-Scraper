See attached build log.

(Please do not complain about the need for looking at the build log until you can provide an easy way to open bugs with the correct data picked out of a tinderbox log. Thanks.)

Hi Diego,
On an ~amd64 system here, I cannot reproduce that bug. The build does not exhibit any QA warning, and the log clearly shows that {LD,C}FLAGS are appended where the sould be. Any hint on what I should do to reproduce ?

Rechecked, can't reproduce. But I replaced the workaround by a patch and added verbosity flags showing that our LDFLAGS get respected.
