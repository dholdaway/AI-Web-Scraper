hi,

i just added xinerama use flag to thunderbird, since i installed a twinview second monitor. 
in the same time i had to switch to beryl, since metacity did not maximize to one screen only.
and i just noticed thunderbird and even evolution starts with a black window.
the titlebar and the window border are visible and showing the number of mails in my inbox. when i hover over items in the black screen i see my cursor change to text or finger, so the objects are there, and hopefully active.
i started thunderbird with -options and the options window appeared fine.

i checked my mailbox, thunderbird moved new mails from new to cur.
thunderbird started about 10 times black.
now, i changed nothing, but started typing this report and downloading thunderbird-2.0a1-source.tar.bz2, and i just started again thunderbird, and it shows up ok, no black window.

Stick xinerama into /etc/make.conf and run emerge -NuDav world; adding xinerama flag to thunderbird _only_ asks for trouble.

that's the way i did.
anyways, i finished now upgrading to mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-2.0_alpha1, and i have not experienced the problem yet.
