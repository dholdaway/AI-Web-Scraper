Description


August Hörandl

At the end of march ist was possible to fetch stage3-x86-uclibc-2008.0.tar.bz2 and portage-20090330.tar.bz2 and update the system - just one block (sys-apps/mktemp had to be unmerged by hand).

On July, 9th we get (the same stage3 and emerge --sync):
one block (sys-apps/mktemp) and a lot of failures

* The following 5 packages have failed to build or install:
*
*      ('ebuild', '/', 'sys-devel/gcc-4.3.2-r3', 'merge')
*      ('ebuild', '/', 'sys-fs/udev-141', 'merge')
*      ('ebuild', '/', 'sys-apps/util-linux-2.14.2', 'merge')
*      ('ebuild', '/', 'sys-apps/shadow-4.1.2.2', 'merge')
*      ('ebuild', '/', 'dev-db/libdbi-drivers-0.8.3', 'merge')

And this is form updating the base system only. Other packages won't compile either: e.g iptables

Is uclibc is still supported? Why aren't there any new stageX-files, building them regulary would show all of the above errors? 

Reproducible: Always

The problem you ask is a bit complex. The root problem is there is no clean upgrade path from 0.9.28 to current.  Current uClibc will fail with gcc-4.4.0
uClibc requires gcc-4.x now.
Hardened still uses gcc-3.x now.

However the uClibc tinderbox is kept up to date in ~arch.

But yep. uClibc is starting to die off. There seems to be a lack of interest from devs/users.
