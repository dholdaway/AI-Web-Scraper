These neurons display a well-defined organization with respect to their afferent innervation. Nociceptive afferents innervate lamina I and II, while cutaneous mechanosensory afferents primarily innervate sensory interneurons that are located in lamina III–IV. In this study, we outline a combinatorial transcription factor code that defines nine different inhibitory and excitatory interneuron populations in laminae III–IV of the postnatal cord. This transcription factor code reveals a high degree of molecular diversity in the neurons that make up laminae III–IV, and it lays the foundation for systematically analyzing and manipulating these different neuronal populations to assess their function. In addition, we find that many of the transcription factors that are expressed in the dorsal spinal cord at early postnatal times continue to be expressed in the adult, raising questions about their function in mature neurons and opening the door to their genetic manipulation in adult animals.PLOSShow moreShow lessSave Cite Cited by 71 Related articles All 16 versions  Cached PrivacyTermsHelpAbout ScholarSearch help
