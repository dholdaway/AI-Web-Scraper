into linux-gazette-all ebuild does not install vol 02 to 08, and emerge --depclean try always to uninstal these vols.

RDEPEND=$(eval echo =app-doc/linux-gazette-{0{1,9},{10..${PV}}})
===============================================^================
should be:
RDEPEND=$(eval echo =app-doc/linux-gazette-{0{1..9},{10..${PV}}})
===============================================^^================

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.emerge linux-gazette-all
2.emerge --depclean
3.
Actual Results:  
does not instal vols 02 to 08 and --depclean
tries to uninstall linux-gazette 02 to 08

Expected Results:  
should install all vols of linux-gazette and --depclean
should not bring to uninstall any of linux-gazette vols

nothing serious, just annoying.

the dep is correct.  packages 02 to 08 are not real packages.  01 provides them.
