Description


Daniel Plaza





          2008-07-20 19:04:33 UTC
        

The plugin fails to load with this error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "trayicon.py", line 17, in <module>
    import _trayicon as trayicon
ImportError: No module named _trayicon

The problem is that the python module egg.trayicon is not found. dev-python/gnome-python-extras contains this module and should be added as dependency.

Reproducible: Always

The problem is dev-python/gnome-python-extras will pull you half the Gnome packages as dependencies.

It's strange you don't have _trayicon on your system, which is part of the quodlibet package. I have it here: /usr/lib64/quodlibet/_trayicon.so.

_trayicon does not handle icon transparency correctly though, so you'll have the background displayed around the icon.

egg.trayicon is deprecated as well, I just spent about 2 hours replacing it with gtk.StatusIcon. I should get in contact with quodlibet developers to make an update. I'm inexperienced in this direction though, it might take some time.

Or should I make some kind of a patch and post it here?

This will be fixed soon.

It would be best if you could file a bug on the quodlibet bug system and post a link to that bug here.

I've removed gnome-python-extras and the problem is only the transparency. So, the dependency isn't necesary.
