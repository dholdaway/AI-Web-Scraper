Description

          2022-12-03 09:23:26 UTC
        

normal 'emerge -u' upgrade from 3.44.4-r3 to 3.44.4-r4 fails for missing patch.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.emerge -u evolution
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
 * ERROR: mail-client/evolution-3.44.4-r4::gentoo failed (prepare phase):
 *   patch -p1  failed with /var/tmp/portage/mail-client/evolution-3.44.4-r4/files/3.44.4-I-2001-Mail-Update-preview-s-iframe-height-to-match-.patch


Expected Results:  
emerge succeeds

this seems to have been caused since https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=883399 as i have mail-client/evolution-3.44.4-r3 installed

seems to have self-resolved after re-running eix-sync (eg emerge --sync)

...confusing since syncing portage is what seems to have introduced the problem...
