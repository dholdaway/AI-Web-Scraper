Hiya,

So gnuplot-py features a test.py file in the same directory as the setup.py file.  Unfortunately the latest distutils now imports from the test module, and the local test.py takes precedence in the namespace, and everything breaks.

A quick fix is simply to move the file, but I've attached a patch that moves the file and also changes all references to the file in the documentation.

This seems to be resolved in the final python 2.6 release. Please re-open if you can reproduce.

Thanks, Mike.
