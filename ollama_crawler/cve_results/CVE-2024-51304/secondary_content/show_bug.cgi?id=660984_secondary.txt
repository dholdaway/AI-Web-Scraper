Description

          2018-07-12 07:43:19 UTC
        

example output:

kuzetsa@a910231c ~ $ eselect rc show
Status of init scripts in runlevel "default"
/opt/redacted/usr/share/eselect/modules/rc.eselect: line 70: service_stopping: command not found
/opt/redacted/usr/share/eselect/modules/rc.eselect: line 70: service_starting: command not found
/opt/redacted/usr/share/eselect/modules/rc.eselect: line 70: service_inactive: command not found
/opt/redacted/usr/share/eselect/modules/rc.eselect: line 70: service_started: command not found
/opt/redacted/usr/share/eselect/modules/rc.eselect: line 70: service_stopped: command not found

(hardcoded) workaround / troubleshooting remedy by updating line:

local PATH=/lib/rc/bin:/lib64/rc/bin:${PATH} # path to service_* commands

to contain the prefix path:

/opt/redacted

Looks like the bug is not reproducible with OpenRC 0.42.1.
