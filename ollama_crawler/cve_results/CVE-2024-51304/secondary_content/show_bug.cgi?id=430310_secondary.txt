emerge --info

PC freezes when screen enters energy saver mode. The only way to resume is to hard reboot the machine.

As a walk around, I restored the system to its previous state. In settings dialog of xscreensaver, I clicked on Advanced Tab and unchecked box in Gestion d'alimentation de l'écran (upper right panel).

I also noticed kind of latency when typing or moving around in browser (google-chrome). That also happens when launching or closing an application (e.g. Terminal)

Does downgrading to 5.18 solve the issue?

That does not solve the issue.

As with 5.19 when I launch xscreensaver from Settings, application window pops up and PC freezes. Application window is like a blank dialog box. Just a window with its frame, no contents.

IMHO, this has something in relation with X and/or mesa.

When I'm telling that PC freezes when application window pops up, I mean that neither keyboard nor mouse is responsive, they are unavailable.

It seems that everything is now working fine. Here are different tests that I ran :

1.

xscreensaver 5.19 along with xorg-server-1.12-3 + xorg-x11-7,4-r2 + mesa-8.0.4

2.

xscreensaver 5.19 along with xorg-server-1.12.99.904 + xorg-x11-7.4-r2 + mesa-8.0.4

3.

xscreensaver 5.19 along with xorg-server-1.12.3 + xorg-x11-7.4-r2 + mesa-8.1_rel_pre20120724

4. 

xscreensaver 5.19 along with mesa-8.1_rel_pre20120724 + xorg-x11-7.4-r2 + xorg-server-1-12.99.904

At time of submitting my configuration is like the one in #4 and all is ok. All tested environments are saved and can be restored anytime (rsync).

All related drivers were rebuild after upgrade to xorg-server-1-12.99.904.

If you think that this bug be close, please do so.  Thanks.
