Description

3.0.5 moved conf file from /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf to /etc/vsftpd.conf and
this broke our app which generates /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf changes

Moving to /etc/vsftp.conf will break backwards compatibility.
I wonder if vsftpd can support /etc/conf.d/vsftpd where one can write
  VSFTPD_OPTS=/etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf
to restore old behaviour?

Sorry, but it really should never have been installed in /etc/vsftpd/ in the first place. The upstream default is /etc/vsftpd.conf.

To override the default config path, you can set command_args in /etc/conf.d/vsftpd.

> command_args="/etc/vsftpd.conf"

Sure.

Ah, didn't know I already could do that. Thanks
