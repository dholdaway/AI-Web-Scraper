 Inside Pilgrims Pride Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including changes in assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies.



 Other - Other   Highlight
In 2023, we experienced an increase in long-term treasury rates that management determined could negatively affect discount rates, which are used in estimating the fair value of the reporting units.

 Other - Other   Highlight
However, the percentage of additional payment cannot be accurately estimated as of the time the issuance of these Financial Statements, particularly due to the fact that the impact of Pillar 2 will be based on 2024 results, which cannot yet be known.

 Other - Other   Highlight
The mortality assumption reflects experience from representative populations, based on the Pri-2012 Private Retirement Plans Mortality Table Report issued by the Society of Actuaries (“SOA”) in October 2019 and the Mortality Improvement Scale MP-2021 Report issued by the SOA in October 2021.
