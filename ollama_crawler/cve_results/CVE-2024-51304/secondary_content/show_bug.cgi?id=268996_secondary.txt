bootchartd spams the terminal repeatedly during boot if said boot takes longer than normal due to FSCK.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. have a filesystem that needs checking on boot
2. have bootchart installed and enabled
3. reboot

Actual Results:  
/sbin/bootchartd: line 112: echo: write error: no space left on device
/sbin/bootchartd: line 116: echo: write error: no space left on device
repeats ad nauseum to the tune of two or three a second.

Expected Results:  
"bootchartd: boot taking too long, disabling bootchart"

You know...there is a configuration option for this.

%% grep -A2 tmpfs /etc/bootchartd.conf
# tmpfs size
# (32 MB should suffice for ~20 minutes worth of log data, but YMMV)
TMPFS_SIZE=32m

why is this invalid?  regardless of the option, the program should not spam the console repeatedly during boot.

It is invalid because there is a configuration option to not "spam" the console. In other words, easily preventable when properly setup by the end user.

If you still think it is a bug, it should be taken upstream. Regardless, I will pass this on to the java team which maintains this package for review

thank you, that's a little better than "it's your fault, get lost".

Works for me as it is. Of course, patches welcome to reopen the bug.
