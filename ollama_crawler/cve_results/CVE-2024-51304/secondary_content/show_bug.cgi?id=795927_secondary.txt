Possible context of error(s):

Package 'fontconfig', required by 'pango', not found
configure: error: Package requirements (gtk+-3.0 >= 3.0.0 glib-2.0) were not met:

I don't see how this can happen. pango unconditionally depends on fontconfig, and fontconfig doesn't appear to have been installed in your logs, even though pango was.
