Description

          2005-11-01 13:48:00 UTC
        

if I uncomment the PORT_LOGDIR=/var/log/portage, emerge doesn't work.
it stops at begin of work, after MD5sum. top shows python2.4 in waiting state.

this is the directory in /var/log:
drwxrws---  2 portage  portage     512 Nov  1 16:51 portage/

note that the directory permission will be reset every time I launch emerge

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. uncomment PORT_LOGDIR=/var/log/portage, in make.conf
2. mkdir /var/log/portage
3. chown portage:portage /var/log/portage
4. emerge <any-package>, or emerge -C <any-package>

Can you confirm this with newer versions of portage?

Can't reproduce here, maybe fixed with recent portages.
