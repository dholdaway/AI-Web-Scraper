Description

          2009-02-26 09:39:53 UTC
        

I download a file.
I try to open it from the download manager (right-click on the file, and "Open"). Nothing happens.
If I run firefox from a terminal, I see this error : 
Error: Couldn't open file 'file:///tmp/<filename>'
If I paste the 'file:///tmp/<filename>' url in the address bar, the associated application pops up.

Happens with all kind of files

The option "Open containing folder" doesn't work either.

I run a fluxbox desktop, maybe firefox doesn't integrate well with it...



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. On a gentoo without gnome and kde, but with fluxbox
2. Launch firefox
3. Download a file
4. Open the Download manager
5. Right-click on the file, choose Open

Actual Results:  
Error : Can't open file://<filename>

Expected Results:  
Firefox should, eihter fire the associated application or at least ask what application should be used to open the file.

xdg-open correctly opens the file.
USE flags : dbus ipv6 java linguas_fr mozdevelop startup-notification xulrunner 
As a side note, the option "Open containing folder", should pop-up a file manager or at least ask for one.

I suppose this short comment was meant to say try to emerge mozilla-firefox-bin...
I did that and it works.

Now the bug remains for the mozilla-firefox ebuild, and it's not that great for a gentoo distribution...

Try emerging mozilla-firefox with USE="gnome"

Nice catch ! It works !

However I find confusing the fact that I have to emerge firefox with the gnome keyword when I don't want gnome installed.

A warning when emerging without the gnome keyword would be nice...
