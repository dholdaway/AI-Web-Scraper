When I executed krita after emerging it raised this error : 
 
 koffice (lib kofficecore): ERROR: Couldn't find the native MimeType in krita's desktop file. Check your installation ! 
 
 
 I've just found on the web that just after running kbuildsycoca, krita is working fine. Maybe It could be included in the ebuild in a post-instal script if it's needed.

Please, don't restrict bugs without any reason. Leave those checkboxes alone.

kbuildsycoca runs happen on every un-/merge. Can't reproduce, no other reports. If this problem should crop up again, reopen please.
