$summary

Also, this was the behaviour in KDE 4.9.x and in 4.10.x changed, so can we get back the fancy names again?

And a "descriptive" snapshot attached.

Where does that screenshot come from? It looks and behaves differently than my application launcher.

KSysGuard was changed upstream[1] (by a very familiar name :)) to be more compliant[2] with the desktop entry spec. It is also now more consistent with other KDE SC applications.

I am not sure about KInfoCenter as I cannot locate any commits changing the Name key in years.

Now that you mentioned it, I checked on a stable 4.9.x environment and you're right, it's still KInfoCenter there.

Any chance we can hack those .desktop files to be more user-friendly? [1] seems a user-unfriendly commit to me...
Something like:
- KInfoCenter:
- * Name: Info Center
- * GenericName: KInfoCenter
- KSysGuard:
- * Name: System Monitor
- * GenericName: KSysGuard

That way, IMO, it won't lead to confusion nor be problematic as it was stated in [2].

And answering your question, I'm using the Lancelot launcher (which can be added through the widgets).

Doing this would be contrary to the desktop entry spec[1] which states:

Name	Specific name of the application, for example "Mozilla".
GenericName	Generic name of the application, for example "Web Browser".

Since the behaviour you are expecting is present in the standard launcher, I assume this is a lancelot-specific issue.

It turns out there is a configuration option[1] to toggle this behaviour.

Look in Lancelot settings -> Menu -> Applications.
