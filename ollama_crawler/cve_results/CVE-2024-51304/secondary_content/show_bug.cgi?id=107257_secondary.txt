it'd be good if eclean had an option to protect currently installed and newer
versions of packages. this way you won't have not-yet-installed packages
deleted. currently, this can be done by protecting by file's age

This appears to be implemented:

with nmap 4.50 (stable) installed I downloaded 4.52 and 4.53. So I have all three versions in distfiles. The execution of eclean below produced to candidates for deletion.

server1 bin # eclean -p distfiles
 * Building file list for distfiles cleaning...
 * Your distfiles directory was already clean.

mint bin # ll /usr/portage/distfiles/nmap*
-rw-rw-r-- 1 portage portage 2156077 2006-12-07 23:03 /usr/portage/distfiles/nmap-4.20.tar.bz2
-rw-rw-r-- 1 portage portage 3128562 2008-01-18 07:51 /usr/portage/distfiles/nmap-4.50.tar.bz2
-rw-rw-r-- 1 portage portage 3147364 2008-01-22 21:05 /usr/portage/distfiles/nmap-4.52.tar.bz2
-rw-rw-r-- 1 portage portage 3145948 2008-01-22 21:07 /usr/portage/distfiles/nmap-4.53.tar.bz2
mint bin #

Am I mistaken?

Mike, I think you're referring to distfiles, whereas the O.P. seems to be about packages.

However, I did a test and I'm pretty sure it is implemented in the case of currently installed packages.

I'll test higher-version-than-installed packages and get back.

The following appears to prove that this enhancement has been put into effect.

(test) black ~ # qlist -IvC baselayout
sys-apps/baselayout-1.12.10-r5
(test) black ~ # echo /usr/portage/packages/All/baselayout-1.12.1*
/usr/portage/packages/All/baselayout-1.12.10-r5.tbz2 /usr/portage/packages/All/baselayout-1.12.11.1.tbz2
(test) black ~ # eclean -p packages | grep baselayout
(test) black ~ #

I think this bug can be closed.

This appears to be working now. Please reopen if that is not the case.
