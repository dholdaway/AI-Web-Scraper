That latest torrents that we are providing a tracker for are 2008.0-r1. Let's consider deprecating this service.

Alternatively, we could use torrents for historical releases only as there has been a recent uptick in random requests.

I think there is value for the big LiveCD/DVD releases still, but it does need a full revamp.

Not going to kill it, the LiveDVD releases are on there. But it does need a revamp (out of the scope of this bug).
