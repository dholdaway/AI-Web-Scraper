It would be quite nice if /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia.conf contained the correct path to the README file, which is /usr/share/doc/nvidia-drivers-195.36.24/README.bz and not /usr/share/doc/nvidia-drivers-195.36.24/README.  I know this is trivial, but the fix is equally so.

It's based on the ecompress format used by Portage, it might as well be .xz, .lzma, .gz or something else based on the PORTAGE_COMPRESS variable which you can change yourself. More over, not everyone is using Portage as package manager.

This has been discussed few times already, and the consesus was that we don't need to cater people with the specific compression suffix for documentations.
