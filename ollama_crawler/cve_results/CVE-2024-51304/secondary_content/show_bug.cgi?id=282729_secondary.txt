each xm command generates warnings caused by new versions of sha and set classes in python 2.6.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install python 2.6 or update to this version (use python-updater)
2. install xen-tools 3.3.1/3.4.0
3. use xm utility

So just use 3.4.1.

this is not an option IMHO. 

xen-3.4 did not properly work with xen-sources-2.6.21. there are several systems which have problems with newer xen-kernels. as far as xen-tools-3.3/3.4.0 are in portage they should also support newer python versions or the dependencies needs to be updated.

Hello!

I see these deprecation messages when emerging app-emulation/xen-tools-4.0.0:

 * 
 * Deprecation Warning: Not passing of paths to python_mod_optimize() is deprecated and will be
 * disallowed on 2010-09-01. Call python_mod_optimize() with paths to Python modules.
 * The ebuild needs to be fixed. Please report a bug, if it has not been already reported.
 *
