 Inside Slm Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Revenue - Product   Highlight
These gains and losses, recorded in “Gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities, net,” are primarily caused by interest rate volatility and changing credit spreads during the period as well as the volume and term of derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment.



 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Management overlays increased in 2022 due to several factors, including additional provisions for our expectation of higher future loan losses related to the previously announced credit administration practices changes we implemented in 2021, “gap year” loans, a shortage and lack of tenured collections staff, and other operational challenges we experienced in 2022.

 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
Cash flows on derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are not recorded in interest income and interest expense; they are recorded in non-interest income: “Gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities, net.”

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
When interest rates rise, the yield on our interest-earning assets typically increases faster than our cost of funds.
