Hi! If I remove my existing cups config and upgrade to cups-1.2.6 from cups-1.1.x
and start the kcontrol printer module, I get the error message:

"Unable to retrieve the printer list. Error message received from manager:
Connection to CUPS server failed. Check that the CUPS server is correctly installed and running. Error: the IPP request failed for an unknown reason."

I'll append my working cups-1.1.x cupsd config file. I'll try to find out the reason and report back.

Can you confirm that downgrading cups fixes the problem?

Better not. Downgrading breaks stuff. Finding out what is broken is generally a better idea. It works for me to see the list of my remote machine here.

After a bit of searching, I found this lengthy KDE bug discussion:
http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115891
Long story short: kdeprint doesn't like a empty printer list in conjunction with cups-1.2.x. There's a patch against kdeprint attached. There is also some IPP over sockets problem, but I didn't dig into this. For now I use as a workaround a fresh cups config along with my old printers.conf and it works fine.

will close as worksforme(you) then. I hope upstream will fix it in their next version.

You sure that this is a good idea? Everyone starting from scratch and using KDE will run into this problem.
