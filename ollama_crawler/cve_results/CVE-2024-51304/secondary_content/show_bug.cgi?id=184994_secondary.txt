you probably need more ram or remove -pipe as the error:

xgcc: Internal error: Killed (program cc1)

means the kernel killed the program

also check `dmesg` to see if anything interesting is in there

I checked dmesg, and i saw that my system has not swap memory (I made the partition, but i forgot to make mkswap -c /dev/sda2)
