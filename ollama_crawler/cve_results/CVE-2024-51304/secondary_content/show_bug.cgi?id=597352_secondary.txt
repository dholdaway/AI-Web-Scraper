Since the first time i've used Git Cola up until now, the application icon for Git Cola is missing. It is not working in XFCE Menu or in any of the docks i've used. You can see an icon in XFCE Panel if program is running but its not showing otherwise. There is a git-cola.svg in /usr/share/git-cola/icons/git-cola.svg but somehow i think this is not correct. Is this upstream releated or could this be fixed with the ebuild?

Could be that your XFCE installation doesn't have SVG icon support.
Please make sure that you have 'svg' USE enabled for related XFCE packages, e.g. xfce4-meta.

I have svg enabled in every package possible. I can see every icon except for git-cola. I could help tracking the problem but i don't really know where to start. Where would an application icon usually be? I see allot of icons in /usr/share/icons but not git-cola.

I am not sure if anyone from Gentoo fixed it or it was fixed by upstream. Icons are showing up now everywhere for the first time ever! Thanks allot! This can be closed i think.
