Description


Göktürk Yüksek







          2015-08-25 05:20:00 UTC
        

As an example: bug 558406 has been assigned to me, however I haven't received any notifications about this. I normally receive emails when I'm on the CC list. I don't seem to be the only person suffering from this per discussions on #gentoo-proxy-maint.

I clicked 'Enable All Mail' on bugzilla email preferences just to be sure but it hasn't had any effects. I am not sure if this is a particular problem for proxy-maintainers or any non-dev users in general.


Reproducible: Always

Just an update: Even for this bug, which I've created, I did not receive notification emails until I've manually added myself to the CC list.

Proxy maintainers don't have any special status in bugz, and I just got email on my test account.

Filing a new test bug for you:
Bug 558652 has been added to the database
Email sent to:
gokturk@binghamton.edu
Excluding:
a3li@gentoo.org

assigning it to me:
Email sent to:
gokturk@binghamton.edu, alex@a3li.li

and back to you: (ditto)

Checking the mail server logs, you get all email sent to you from my test.

Can you attach a screenshot of your email preferences?

Note the last two rows. You are NOT getting ANY email if a) you make the change (that explains comment #3); or b) the bug is in UNCONFIRMED state (as was bug 558406).

Reopen if this still happens despite fixing the overrides as explained above.
