Korea business results that contributed $0.47 and $0.45, respectively•Full-year 2023 cash from operations was $1,057 million, up from $152 million in 2022 •The Company expects its full-year 2024 outlook for reported EPS to be in the range of $10.20 to $11.15 and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $9.15 to $9.85, reflecting the impact of the S. Korea business divestitureWESTCHESTER, Ill., February 6, 2024 – Ingredion Incorporated (NYSE: INGR), a leading global provider of ingredient solutions to the food and beverage manufacturing industry, today reported results for the fourth quarter of 2023 and full-year 2023. The results, reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022 and full-year 2023 and 2022, include items that are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures that the Company presents.“Our business performed exceptionally well and remained resilient throughout 2023, delivering more than 20% operating income growth for both the fourth quarter and full year. Our targeted pricing actions and proactive cost savings initiatives helped overcome inflation and raw material volatility, leading to a sixth consecutive, quarter-over-quarter expansion of gross margin. Additionally, cash from operations exceeded $1 billion dollars, and we returned $295 million dollars to shareholders in the year,” said Jim Zallie, Ingredion’s president and CEO. “We continue to make significant progress strengthening our diversified and balanced portfolio of ingredients and solutions. Specialty ingredients grew mid-single digits, despite volume headwinds as customers destocked and managed inventories lower. In the second half of 2023, we saw a steady recovery of volumes as customer demand strengthened. Throughout the year, our teams demonstrated agility and operational excellence as they continued to balance production schedules and optimize inventory levels at year end.“As we look ahead to 2024, we are confident that the reorganization of our business operations will better align our resources and capabilities with customers’ needs to better target growth opportunities. We are well positioned to deliver profitable growth and margin expansion, as well as generate strong cash flow. We believe our Driving Growth Roadmap continues to guide long-term value creation for our shareholders as we deepen our customer relationships, and drive innovation and operational excellence to win in the marketplace,” Zallie concluded. *Adjusted diluted earnings per share (“adjusted EPS”), adjusted operating income and adjusted effective income tax rate are non-GAAP financial measures. See section II of the Supplemental Financial Information entitled “Non-GAAP Information” following the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this news release for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.The following information was filed by Ingredion Inc (INGR) on Tuesday, February 6, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.
