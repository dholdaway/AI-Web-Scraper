Let's see:

 - autoconf called in src_compile (by rox.eclass (!!!));
 - sandbox violation on /usr (!!!);
 - package simply doesn't build.

what the!

I'll be fixing this soon, I promise!  Patches appreciated.

WFM...

Based on your build-log this looks to be a problem with your rox-base/rox-clib install.  Can you please attach /var/db/pkg/rox-base/rox-clib-2.1.10/CONTENTS 

I'd suggest re-installing rox-base/rox-clib (reserve the build log in case this fails again), and then try rox-base/pager a second time.  If this fails a second time, I'd be very interested in the build log of rox-base/rox-clib.

Okay rebuilding rox-clib helped, thanks Jim :)

There is still something fundamentally wrong with the fact that it broke, but… up to you whether to keep this as a reminder or close it :)

I agree that there was something fundamentally wrong, but I can't begin to imagine what....  I'd still love to see the CONTENTS of the previous (broken) rox-clib, but if it's not around any more that's okay.

If you can't find it, I'll just close this since I don't think I have enough evidence right now to begin to understand what went wrong.

Let's close this then, I'll just open another for the autoconf to track that down; I wouldn't count excessively about transient problems on the tinderbox because they often tend to be almost unreproducible (I have no way to tell with absolute certainty what the heck was merged at the time the package was built).
