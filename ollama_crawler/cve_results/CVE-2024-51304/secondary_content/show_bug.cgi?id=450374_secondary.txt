I want to contribute to gentoo wiki, but i can't write new articles of good quality (i am not native english speaker). But i can translate articles to Russian. Why, while all gentoo.org is multilingual, wiki is only english still?

Reproducible: Always

BTW, if this is not a right place to file a bug about wiki, point me, where to start.

Translation is still being evaluated and will be enabled in due course. We don't need this bug, thus closing.
