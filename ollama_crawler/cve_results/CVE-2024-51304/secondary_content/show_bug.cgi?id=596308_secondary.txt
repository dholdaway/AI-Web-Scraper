When gstreamer 1.8.3 went stable, media-plugins/gst-plugins-srtp-1.8.3 did not.
Is this a mistake?
Also, media-plugins/gst-plugins-meta lacks a srtp USE flag

No, it is new and currently has no user in tree that I know of.
This is similar to the 3 other new plugins that were added with 1.8.3 bump.
If this is a request to have it stable because you need it for something then just say so.

we will try to stabilize it in a future round and, that way, it will have enough time for testing (and we also don't push to much work to arch teams ;)
