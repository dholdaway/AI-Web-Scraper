Abstract
The Oct-2 transcription factor is expressed predominantly in B lymphocytes and has been shown previously to be important for
                     the terminal phase of B-cell differentiation in mice. A number of genes specifically expressed in B cells contain Oct-2-binding
                     sites in their regulatory regions. However, the analysis of expression levels of these genes in Oct-2-deficient B cells revealed
                     that they were unaffected. Hence, there were no genes known that critically depend on Oct-2 for their expression. To understand
                     the molecular basis for the Oct-2 effect on B-cell development, we searched for Oct-2 target genes by subtractive cDNA cloning.
                     We show here that expression of the murine CD36 gene in B cells and macrophages requires a functional Oct-2 protein. Nuclear
                     run-on experiments demonstrate that this gene is regulated transcriptionally by Oct-2. Moreover, CD36 levels correlated with
                     the levels of Oct-2 expression in several mouse B-cell and macrophage cell lines. Finally, compared to wild-type and heterozygous
                     mice, CD36 mRNA levels were markedly reduced in spleens and B-cell-enriched splenocyte fractions from oct-2-/- mice. The data
                     identify CD36 as the first target gene critically dependent on Oct-2 for its expression. Because CD36 expression is also dependent
                     on Oct-2 in vivo, it is a candidate gene through which Oct-2 could affect B-cell differentiation.
