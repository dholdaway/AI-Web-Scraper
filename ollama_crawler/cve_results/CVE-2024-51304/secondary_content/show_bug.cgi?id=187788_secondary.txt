www-client/mozilla-firefox-2.0.0.6 forgets history on a newly opened window.

steps to reproduce:
1. Open a link in a new window.
2. Click on any link on the page in the new window.
3. "Back" button stays grayed out, so is the context-menu "back".

Nope, cannot reproduce. Try with a clean profile and without any plugins

Odd thing is, I wasn't able reproduce this either if I start with a fresh profile and even installed the plugins. Even more peculiar is that I've two other machines that exhibit this bug right now with 2.0.0.6. Mark as heisenbug?

Looks like that. If you find out a way to reproduce, it needs to go upstream anyway.
