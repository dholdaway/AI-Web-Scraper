 Inside Charter Communications, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” which describe important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations and non-historical information contained herein.



 Financial - Debt   Highlight
Risk Factors — The agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity.”

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Advertising sales revenues decreased $331 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the corresponding period in 2022 primarily due to a decrease in political revenue.

 Other - Other   Highlight
In determining our tax provision for financial reporting purposes, we establish a reserve for uncertain tax positions unless such positions are determined to be “more likely than not” of being sustained upon examination, based on their technical merits.

 Financial - Debt   Highlight
Net cash used in financing activities decreased $2.5 billion during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to a decrease in the purchase of treasury stock and noncontrolling interest partly offset by a decrease in the amount by which borrowings of long-term debt exceeded repayments.
