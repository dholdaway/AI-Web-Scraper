Net income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $15.0 million, down $4.5 million or 23.3% compared to the $19.5 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2022.  Contributing to the lower quarterly results were increased funding costs and increased operating expenses, which included costs related to three branch closures during the fourth quarter of 2023 as well as personnel-related charges.For the year ended December 31, 2023, diluted earnings per share of $0.66 were down 88.8% compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.   Net income for 2023 was $9.5 million, a decrease of $75.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.  Significant contributors to the year-over-year decrease in net income included a previously announced after-tax loss of $52.9 million, or $3.69 loss per diluted share, related to the sale of $510.5 million of available-for-sale debt securities, increased funding costs and an increase in operating expenses. The sale of securities and subsequent reinvestment in the second and third quarters of 2023 is favorably impacting securities revenue as the securities sold had an average yield of 0.86%, while the proceeds of the sale were largely reinvested into securities with an estimated yield of approximately 5.09%.  Average yields on securities for the fourth quarter of 2023 were 2.33%, compared to 1.59% for the third quarter of 2023, and 1.44% for the fourth quarter of 2022.    Tompkins President and CEO, Stephen Romaine, commented, "In the fourth quarter we continued to execute on strategic initiatives and are pleased to announce our expanded presence in Syracuse with the grand opening of our City Center office.  For the quarter we saw positive momentum with our net interest margin expanding, strong quarterly loan growth driving full year loan growth of 6.4%, signs of stabilization in our deposit base and The following information was filed by Tompkins Financial Corp (TMP) on Friday, January 26, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.

 Inside Tompkins Financial Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
Management considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance to be a critical accounting policy, given the inherent uncertainty in evaluating the levels of the allowance required to cover credit losses in the portfolio and the material effect that assumptions could have on the Company’s results of operations.



 Other - Other   Highlight
Changes in the circumstances considered when determining management's estimates and assumptions could result in changes in those estimates and assumptions, which could result in adjustment of the allowance for credit losses in future periods.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operation and financial condition.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Under this accounting guidance, the allowance for credit losses represents a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of certain financial assets, including loans and leases, to present the net amount expected to be collected at the balance sheet date.

 Other - Other   Highlight
There are uncertainties inherent in making these estimates and assumptions, which could materially affect the Company’s results of operations and financial position.
