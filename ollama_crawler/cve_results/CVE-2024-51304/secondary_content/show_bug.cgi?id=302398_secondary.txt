Description

Milkytracker fails to build on an amd64 Funtoo install. Alsa and Jack useflags are both set, and those are all that appear to be available for it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. (May or may not be necessary) Enable alsa and jack USE flags.
2. emerge media-sound/milkytracker-0.90.80

Actual Results:  
Eventually, a number of undefined reference warnings show up, and a message stating "ld returned 1 exit status" is printed to the console, followed by "emake failed."

Expected Results:  
Milkytracker should have compiled and installed normally.

As a quick update to this, as of my latest emerge --sync, the package is building correctly with no change to use flags.
