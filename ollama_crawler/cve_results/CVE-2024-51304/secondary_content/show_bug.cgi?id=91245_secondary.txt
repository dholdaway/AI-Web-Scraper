Description

There's a directory on the jabberd2 tarball called tools which contains some useful things, for example, SQL commands to initialize the tables for jabberd2 in various RDBMS.
It'd be nice if that directory gets copied to somewhere on the system, like /usr/share/docs/jabberd2.../tools/ or something like that.

Reproducible: Always

It's copied in /usr/share/doc/jabberd-2.0.8-r1/tools by default. You can patch
the ebuild with the following patch to have a symlink in /etc/jabbed to
/usr/share/doc/${jabber_version}/tools.

As stated in comment #1 - it's already there.
