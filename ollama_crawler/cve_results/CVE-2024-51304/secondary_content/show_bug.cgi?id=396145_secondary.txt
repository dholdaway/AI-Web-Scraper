net-dialup/ppp already ships with /etc/modprobe.d/ppp.conf for required module aliases, it's not required to duplicate this in /etc/modprobe.d/aliases.conf.

Actually the kernel modules provides these alias and they're indexed in the optimized index /lib/modules/`uname -r`/modules.alias.bin used by modprobe. If possible do not provide these replicas (should I fill a bug to net-dialup/ppp as well?)



Reproducible: Always

i doubt the kernel has always provided these things, and having the aliases duplicated causes no harm, so i'm not inclined to "fix" things

Well, the kernel provides this for a LONG time, likely since .modinfo section started to carry "alias" fields, maybe before that during ".modalias" days as well.

Indeed there is no harm, in the sense bad things will happen, but the fix is super-simple and I wonder why not take it? Just delete the ppp lines and you're good to go.

This will avoid some crap into modprobe lookups. Not an amazing impact, for sure, but if it could be easily avoided, why not?
