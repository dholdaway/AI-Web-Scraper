seems to be due to this:
[rospack] Warning: cannot create rospack cache directory /var/lib/portage/home/.ros: boost::filesystem::create_directory: Permission denied: "/var/lib/portage/home/.ros"
[rospack] Warning: cannot create rospack cache directory /var/lib/portage/home/.ros: boost::filesystem::create_directory: Permission denied: "/var/lib/portage/home/.ros"


did you mess the permissions there ?
