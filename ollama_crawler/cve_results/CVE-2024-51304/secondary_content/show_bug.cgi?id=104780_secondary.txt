Many net-im, jabber related, ebuilds will be changed to reflect new directory
schema introduced by net-im/jabber-base. This change need to be documented as
location of user data will be changed, location of logs and pids some scripts
depend on will be changed etc. This is workplace for document that will describe
all these changes and will be eventually presented to GWN readers or will be
linked from einfo from affected packages. Something similar was done when there
was apache change, please see:

I'm CC'ing the current maintainer for jabber-base. Once things are more
concrete, we can work out something for the users.

Humpback, what say?

Two years out of date, and jabber seems stable enough. Clooooosing.
