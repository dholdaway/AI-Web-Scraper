Description

          2010-01-31 13:58:39 UTC
        

tfoerste@n22 ~ $ xboard -size Medium
X Error of failed request:  BadName (named color or font does not exist)
  Major opcode of failed request:  45 (X_OpenFont)
  Serial number of failed request:  20
  Current serial number in output stream:  21

"Small" and "Big" however works. I do not have a xorg.conf anymore (w/ an xorg.conf I've to set at least the basi font path and "Medium" would work too).


Reproducible: Always

pick a font from:

for d in $(xset q | sed -n '/^Font Path:/{n;s/,/ /g;p;q}'); do cat $d/fonts.dir; done | awk '{ print $2 }'

and pass it to xboard with -font

You're probably just missing the default font, but you can use whatever one you want.

resync, then emerge xboard again and restart your X server to make sure it's picking up the font.

Worked fine here with only these fonts installed, 

media-fonts/corefonts-1-r4
media-fonts/dejavu-2.30
media-fonts/encodings-1.0.3-r1
media-fonts/font-adobe-100dpi-1.0.1
media-fonts/font-alias-1.0.2
media-fonts/font-cursor-misc-1.0.1
media-fonts/font-misc-misc-1.1.0
media-fonts/freefont-ttf-20090104
media-fonts/gnu-gs-fonts-std-8.11

Having either one of media-fonts/font-adobe-75dpi or media-fonts/font-adobe-100dpi works
