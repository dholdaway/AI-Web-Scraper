Rogers Corporation Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 ResultsNavigating Challenging Environment With Focus On ExecutionChandler, Arizona, February 21, 2024: Rogers Corporation (NYSE:ROG) today announced financial results for the full year and fourth quarter of 2023."We made significant progress this past year as we drove structural cost improvements, secured new design wins, generated solid free cash flow, and invested in targeted capacity expansions to drive future growth,” stated Colin Gouveia, Rogers' President and CEO. "In the fourth quarter, the macroeconomic headwinds we faced throughout 2023 persisted, resulting in further inventory destocking by customers and softness in many end markets. The lower sales volumes, especially in industrial and portable electronics markets, more than offset our cost improvements in the quarter and resulted in lower gross margins. Looking ahead, we anticipate the demand environment will remain challenging in the first quarter, but that we will begin to see some improvement midyear. We will continue to navigate the dynamic conditions with a clear focus on executing our strategy and managing what is within our control."Financial OverviewGAAP ResultsQ4 2023Q3 2023Q4 202220232022Net Sales ($M)$204.6$229.1$223.7$908.4$971.2Gross Margin32.9%35.1%31.8%33.8%33.1%Operating Margin14.9%11.8%37.0%9.4%14.9%Net Income (Loss) ($M)$23.2$19.0$67.3$56.6$116.6Net Income (Loss) Margin11.3%8.3%30.1%6.2%12.0%Diluted Earnings Per Share$1.24$1.02$3.58$3.03$6.15Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities ($M)$71.9$42.0$127.6$131.4$129.5Non-GAAP Results1Q4 2023Q3 2023Q4 202220232022Adjusted Operating Margin6.3%14.3%9.3%11.2%11.7%Adjusted Net Income ($M)$11.3$23.2$19.5$70.7$93.0Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share$0.60$1.24$1.04$3.78$4.91Adjusted EBITDA ($M)$23.4$45.4$27.8$147.7$160.2Adjusted EBITDA Margin11.4%19.8%12.5%16.3%16.5%Free Cash Flow ($M)$49.4$35.3$97.8$74.4$12.7Net Sales by Operating Segment (dollars in millions)Q4 2023Q3 2023Q4 202220232022Advanced Electronics Solutions (AES)$117.3$126.4$125.3$509.7$530.2Elastomeric Material Solutions (EMS)$83.4$98.0$93.7$379.0$420.0Other$3.9$4.8$4.7$19.7$21.01 - A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in the schedules included below                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1The following information was filed by Rogers Corp (ROG) on Wednesday, February 21, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.
