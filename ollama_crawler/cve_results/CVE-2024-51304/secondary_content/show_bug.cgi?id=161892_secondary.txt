Description


Pablo Trabajos

When eagle is started there are no windows decorations, when the button is pressed on the taskbar it doesn't bring it to the front, can't resize it and can't move it with ALT+click. I.e.: it is unmanaged by window manager (xfwm4).

I'm using xfce4-4.3.99.2-r1.

These are the dependant libs:
sci-electronics/eagle-4.16_p1:
                    sys-libs/glibc           sys-libs/glibc-2.4-r4
                    x11-libs/libX11          x11-libs/libX11-1.1.1
                    x11-libs/libXau          x11-libs/libXau-1.0.2
                    x11-libs/libXdmcp        x11-libs/libXdmcp-1.0.1
                    x11-libs/libXext         x11-libs/libXext-1.0.1

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open eagle
2.See that there are no borders, check you can't move it with Alt+Click...
3.Also, windows appear on taskbar but you can't bring them to front or back.

Actual Results:  
Windows are unmanaged by window manager.

Expected Results:  
Screen managed by window manager (window decorations, moveable windows, etc).

1- I realize my arch is not keyworded. But it works perfectly and should be arched for amd64. Problem is that I won't bother to do it because of this problem. Please understand I shouldn't submit a bug for an unkeyworded app yet I can't keyword it amd64 because of the bug... If this is not the correct procedure, my apologies.

2- Eagle was working fine some days ago but I don't know what did I change... I haven't updated the WM.

3- I get window decorations with beryl but the whole window is like a negative (I don't have the negative plugin activated). I only say this because ir may be related and help track the bug. Or maybe not. I don't really use beryl...

Here is a screenshot:

Forgot to say the eagle version is 4.16_p1.

It works fine with kahakai.  As this isn't an open source app, I'm not entirely sure what I can do about this.  Any suggestions?

Works perfectly with fvwm.

Maybe something nonstandard is happening? I can only suggest you contact cadsoft about the problem, they seem to be friendly.

Have you asked other xfce users/devs about this?  I imagine it was the first place you tried, but any information would be helpful.  I would think they'd have better debugging procedures since they know the wm better.

I did. And their understanding is that is not a xfwm4 (xfce4 WM) issue. I told them that you were running other WM and they replied that if you'r running (for example) fvwm or kahakai it was impossible that beryl was running too, since you can't have two WM runing at once. And I think they are right, unless I'm mising something.

The troubleshoot should be centered around beryl, so it would be more useful if people try eagle with beryl and see if they get white windows. Post versions also. I just tried eagle-4.16_p1 + beryl-0.2.1 and still fails.

Huh? Of course neither of us is running beryl, we are running our WM's. Unless you are trying to run beryl with xfce's WM still running (??), which is of course impossible.

Sorry. I somewhat mixed the two sides of this problem: one was a problem with beryl (which persists), the other with xfwm4 (which is gone). I'm sorry for the confusion on my last comment.

xfwm4 now manages the decoration. I did a lot of updates recently (x libs, x server, and more) and it's fixed. I suspect the bug was at xserver side but I can't pinpoint it.

The beryl issue is still there, and since the xfwm4 issue is gone there is no reason to think the two are related (I did when I started this thread). And it's not really that important.

By my side you can close this bug as resolved.

Thanks for the info.  I originally didn't separate the two issues and now I'm curious how it runs under beryl.  If I can reproduce it, I'll keep the issue open.  Feel free to remove yourself from the CC list, but if I make progress on this issue, I'll update here.

I will stay in the CC list.See how on the screenshot the window body is very pale and a bit pink. Also is remarkable how the inner working area appears transparent when it should be black and opaque (I configured beryl so focused windows are fully opaque).

I have it installed on an amd64 machine and am using beryl with it.  The wm decorates it, but I am noticing the inside is a little translucent.  I found a decent wiki at http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beryl that assisted me in getting my window decorations to work in the first place.  Does any of it (i.e. the nvidia part) apply to you?

Perhaps http://www.cadsoft.de/faq.htm#17040701 will help here (from bug 188368, comment 7).

Just going through old bugs...is this still an issue with the latest stable eagle?

Seems this bug is very old and out of date.
