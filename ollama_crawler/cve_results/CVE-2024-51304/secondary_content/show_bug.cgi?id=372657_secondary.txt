Description

got tired to see all the

Gtk-Message: Failed to load module "canberra-gtk-module": libcanberra-gtk-module.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

and similar warnings ... simply adding 

echo "GTK_MODULE=/usr/lib64/gtk-2.0/modules/" > /etc/env.d/51gtk2 

prevents this. so why not do this when emerging gtk?



Reproducible: Always

Because we are unable to reproduce that messages

hmmm, i've seen this on more then one Gentoo machines, so i thought everyone would. because i can't think of another way to isolate the cause but do a fresh install, i'll mark this as resolved/worksforme until i can provide a valid way for you to reproduce. hope you're ok with that ;).
