Afrezza® net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 increased $3.5 million, or 29%, compared to the same period in 2022 as a result of higher product demand and higher price (including a decrease in gross-to-net adjustments as a percentage of gross sales). V-Go® net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased $0.7 million, or 13%, compared to the same period in 2022 as a result of lower product demand and an increase in rebates (as a percentage of gross sales). Collaborations and services revenue increased $7.7 million, or 81%, compared to the same period in 2022 primarily attributable to an increase in manufacturing Tyvaso DPI for United Therapeutics ("UT"). Royalties related to Tyvaso DPI for the fourth quarter of 2023 increased $12.0 million, or 132%, primarily as a result of increased patient demand. 
Commercial product gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 70% compared to 77% for the same period in 2022. The decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to an increase in cost of goods sold for Afrezza due to the timing of the capitalization of costs to inventory and lower net revenue for V-Go.
