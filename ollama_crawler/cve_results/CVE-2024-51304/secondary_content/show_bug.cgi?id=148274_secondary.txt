Description

If I remove ati-drivers from my system, 'eselect opengl set xorg-x11' runs. If I merge ati-drivers, 'eselect opengl set ati' is run. The problem is that if I upgrade ati-drivers, when the old version is autocleaned, eselect goes back to xorg at the end. If I don't catch it, I will when my CPU hits 100%.

The request is that if ati-drivers is being cleaned as a result of an upgrade, do not revert to xorg-x11.

Assigning to herd, maintainer is apparently MIA.

I have never seen this happen. Also the affected version is not included, nor is emerge --info. Closing WORKSFORME, please reopen if this is still a problem and include more information (log, affected version, emerge --info).
