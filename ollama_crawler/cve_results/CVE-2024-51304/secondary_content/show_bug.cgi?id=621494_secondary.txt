Description

I used a manual (tlmgr) installation of texlive-2016 on gentoo linux, after removing this and installing the texlive-2017 from the distribution I get

` Package pgf Error: Driver file ``pgfsys-luatex.def'' not found.. ...{Driver file ``\pgfsysdriver'' not found.}}`

as described in https://sourceforge.net/p/pgf/bugs/384/ 
Minimal working example:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\makeatletter\show\Gin@driver
\usepackage{tikz}
\begin{document}
\end{document}

Was this bug fixed in the tlmgr-texlive-2016 and made it back into the distribution texlive-2017?

find /usr -name "pgfsys-luatex.de‌​f"

could not find a matching file. 
other systems install it to
/usr/local/texlive/2017/texmf-dist/tex/generic/pgf/systemlayer/pgfsys-luatex.de‌​f

http://www.portagefilelist.de/
could not locate it too.

I have /usr/share/texmf-site/tex/generic/pgf/systemlayer/pgfsys-luatex.def here

maybe your pgf install is broken ?

Can find the package now with pfl. 
merged dev-tex/pgf-3.0.1-r1 and it works now. 
must have been a problem on my system. Sorry for the noise.
