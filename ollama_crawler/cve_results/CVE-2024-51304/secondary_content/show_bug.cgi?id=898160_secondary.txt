Emerge output

When updating media-libs/gegl earlier than dev-python/setuptools-67.2.0-r1, the configure phase fails with 

meson.build:28:0: ERROR: <PythonExternalProgram 'python3' -> ['/usr/bin/python3.10']> is not a valid python or it is missing distutils


A re-run of emerge resulted in the opposite sequence and compilation passes.

The build log got overwritten during the successfull build.

I suspect you just happened to have a bad version of setuptools installed.

Please re-open if you can provide exact steps to reproduce the issue and a build log to go with them.
