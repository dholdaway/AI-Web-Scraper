 Inside American International Group Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Reinsurance Optimization: Strategically partner with reinsurers to effectively manage exposure to losses arising from frequency of large catastrophic events and severity from individual risk losses.



 Legal - Other   Highlight
North America Commercial remains in a firm market amidst a backdrop of increasing claims severity due to elevated economic and social inflation, as well as a higher frequency and severity of natural catastrophe losses over recent years.

 M & A - Other   Highlight
These investment contracts do not have mortality or morbidity risk and are similar to GICs.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
In response to consumer needs and a changing interest rate environment, our Life Insurance product portfolio will continue to promote products with less long-duration interest rate risk and mitigate exposure to products that have long-duration interest rate risk through sales levels and hedging strategies.
