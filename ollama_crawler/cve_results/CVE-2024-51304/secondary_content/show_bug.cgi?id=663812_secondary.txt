Instead of typing out,

--[[User:Rage|Rage]] ([[User talk:Rage|talk]]) 00:00, 00 Month Year (UTC)

Just write,

{{Signed|Rage}}

I'm not sure how/if mediawiki would be able to automatically insert the date dynamically but this would be really nice for discussion pages.

There is already a shortcut for this..

It is:  --~~~~

There is a signature icon on the editor as well that does this.

Many Talk pages are getting reminders to add this.
