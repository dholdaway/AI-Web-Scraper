We ramped our CTO2Grow initiatives to improve the competitiveness of our businesses and help offset continued weakness in our end-markets,” said Emile Chammas, SEE’s Interim Co-CEO and COO. “Our transformation will continue in 2024 with an enhanced focus on restoring underlying fundamentals in our core businesses so we are well positioned to capitalize on growth when our end-markets fully recover.”“We delivered strong free cash flow in the fourth quarter and made significant progress in deleveraging our balance sheet,” said Dustin Semach, SEE’s Interim Co-CEO and CFO. “Our 2024 outlook reflects end-markets that are showing signs of stabilization with limited visibility to any near-term catalysts but we expect our end-markets to recover in the second half.  We continue to be focused on transforming the business, improving fundamentals, and strengthening our balance sheet.""The CEO search process is well underway and we are targeting to complete over the coming months," said Henry Keizer, SEE's Board Chairman. "The Board has tremendous confidence in Emile and Dustin and fully supports the transformation they are driving at SEE."Unless otherwise stated, all results compare fourth quarter 2023 results to fourth quarter 2022 results from continuing operations. Year-over-year financial discussions present operating results from continuing operations as reported. Year-over-year comparisons are also made on an organic basis and constant dollar basis, which are non-U.S. GAAP measures. Organic refers to changes in unit volume and price performance and excludes acquisitions in the first year after closing, divestiture activity and the impact of currency translation. Constant dollar refers to changes in net sales and earnings, excluding the impact of currency translation. Additionally, non-U.S. GAAP adjusted financial measures, such as Adjusted Earnings Before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA"), Adjusted Net Earnings, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share ("Adjusted EPS") and Adjusted Tax Rate, exclude the impact of specified items ("Special Items"), such as restructuring charges, restructuring associated costs, amortization of  | 2415 Cascade Pointe Blvd. | Charlotte, NC 28208                    1The following information was filed by Sealed Air Corpde (SEE) on Tuesday, February 27, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.

 Inside Sealed Air Corpde's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Income   Highlight
If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets.



 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
We reported a net increase in our valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2023 of $26 million, primarily driven by increases in foreign net operating losses and amounts recorded in purchase accounting on Liquibox attributes.
