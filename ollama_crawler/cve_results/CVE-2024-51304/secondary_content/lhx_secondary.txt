Our agility and innovation continue to resonate with customers, enabling us to broaden our capabilities into high-growth markets,” said Christopher E.

These actions are strengthening and better aligning our portfolio with the Department of Defense and U.S. allied partner priorities."Kubasik continued, “We are confident on achieving the financial framework that we shared in early December at our investor day, while we execute on our 2024-2026 capital allocation priorities of reducing leverage and returning excess cash to shareholders. Entering 2024, we remain focused on driving towards the $1 billion cost savings target from our LHX NeXt program to enable operational improvements, margin expansion and free cash flow growth.”PAGE 1 1Key terms and Non-GAAP measures - see definitions at the end of this earnings releaseThe following information was filed by L3harris Technologies, Inc.
