 Inside Atmos Energy Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Expense   Highlight
The amounts expected to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations.Discontinuing the application of this method of accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities or changes in the accounting for our various regulatory mechanisms could significantly increase our operating expenses as fewer costs would likely be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet, which could reduce our net income.



 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Partially offset by: a $33.1 million increase in operating expenses primarily attributable to increased depreciation expense and property taxes associated with increased capital investments, employee-related costs, and pipeline inspection activities.

 Financial - Dividend   Highlight
Additionally, cash dividends increased due to an 8.8 percent increase in our dividend rate and an increase in shares outstanding.
