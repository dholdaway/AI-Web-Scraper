I'm writing an ebuild for an OSL-3.0 program, but only OSL-1.1, 2.0, and 2.1 are currently in portage.

That doesn't really make sense as long as no ebuild in the official tree actually uses it. Also, you can put the new license in the licenses/ subdirectory of your local overlay and it should work fine.

That sounds reasonable.
