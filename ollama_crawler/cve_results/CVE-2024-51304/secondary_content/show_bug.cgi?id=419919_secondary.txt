Given that the error message looks random:
{standard input}: Assembler messages:
{standard input}:367967: Warning: end of file not at end of a line; newline in
serted
{standard input}:369318: Error: unknown pseudo-op: `.cfi_de'
{standard input}: Error: open CFI at the end of file; missing .cfi_endproc dir
ective
x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-g++: Internal error: Killed (program cc1plus)

running out of disk space / memory seems most likely reason.

On unrelated note: while in this case it didn't matter, zip is a *very* poor choice of compression format.

Check dmesg for signs of the OOM killer.

Try dropping -pipe from CFLAGS, and if that does not help, replace -O2 with -O1.

In any case, this is not a gnuradio bug.

It was a memory problem. Increased memory to 1024 MB and it compiled.
