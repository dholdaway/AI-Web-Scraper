19 Feb 2011; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> libtool-2.4-r1.ebuild:
  Block even newer versions of automake #355551 by Tim Yamin.

latest change with libtool breaks automake, since aspell is one of few applications wanting old automake i made my own ebuild without WANT_AUTOMAKE="1.10" and it compiles fine.

Reproducible: Always

It seems like they fixed libtool... however it still seems like automake 1.10 is not needed to compile aspell and 1.11 works fine.

Thank you for report! sys-devel/automake-1.10 is not that old. Also build does not fail here. That said, although I don't see need to drop this line in existing automake ebuild I'm going to drop it in newest. BTW, next time, please, always attach full build log. Resolving as worksforme as this ebuild really works for me :)
