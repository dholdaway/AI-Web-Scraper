The bug is from 2.27.57-r1.

I had to go back to 2.27.57 since I had the same error message when trying to synchronize between two 2.27.57-r1 amd64!
(I have absolutely no problem with 2.27.57 amd64)

there is an elog at the end of the merge:

* Unison now uses SLOTs, so you can specify servercmd=/usr/bin/unison-2.27
* in your profile files to access exactly this version over ssh.
* Or you can use 'eselect unison' to set the version.

did you try one of those ?
eselect unison will restore the old name
