When slocate-2.7-r7 (and presumably -r8) is emerged on a system without
/etc/cron.daily present, its makefile calls install-cron.sh instead of copying
/etc/cron.daily/slocate. This script in turn attempts to modify /etc/crontab
without obeying DESTDIR, causing a sandbox violation.

Patch to force /etc/cron.daily behaviour

Patch to ignore absence of /etc/cron.daily and always install
/etc/cron.daily/slocate.
