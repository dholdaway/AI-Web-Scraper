It is sad to read that you have problems with the software. The situation seems to be a bit more complicate and requires some analysis.
We can not help you efficiently via bug tracker. The bug tracker aims rather on specific problems in .ebuilds and less on individual systems. 

I have had very good experience on the gentoo IRC [1] with questions like this. Of course there are also forums and mailing lists [2,3].
I hope you understand, that I will close the bug here therefore and wish you good luck on one of the mentioned channels [4].
Please reopen the ticket in order to provide an indication for an specific error in an ebuild or any gentoo related product.
