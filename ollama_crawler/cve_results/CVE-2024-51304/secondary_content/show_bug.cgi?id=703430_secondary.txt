Description

Hello,
I have configured one of our servers as a Gentoo mirror (only *rsync for now*). 
I would be glad to make a helpful contribution to the Gentoo project, so If a mirror in Frankfurt is not needed, please let me know. If you think that a full mirror would be a good idea (or not), please, let me know too.

Some data:

 Sponsor Name:CSC (Center for Scientific Computing), Goethe Universitaet Frankfurt
     Location:Frankfurt am Main (Germany)
    Bandwidth:932 Mbits/sec
Admin Contact:palao@csc.uni-frankfurt.de

The mirror can be accessed via the following IP addresses:

IPv4:141.2.212.194
IPv6:fe80::5652:8dff:fe02:d4c2

There is a limit on concurrent connections [amount/no]: 20

Additional comments: I'm open to suggestions/changes

Best regards

We have enough rsync mirrors in Europe, but thanks for your inquiry!
If we need capacity in the future we will reach out.
