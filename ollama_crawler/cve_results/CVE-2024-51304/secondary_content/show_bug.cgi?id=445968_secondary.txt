I talked to WilliamH yesterday about the /run path being prefixed which resulted in the commit in url field.

As with the other prefix runlevel bug, I believe having fixed now, it seems a system boots up the installed runlevels, but it won't boot or recognize additional runlevels set or installed, eg udev in sysinit, dbus, or any runlevel in default.

rc-status also doens't report the added runlevels. It only shows the installed standard ones, which are started.
I suppose the /run issue wasn't entirely fixed.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. compile with prefix=/usr
2. additionally apply patch for missing runlevels.
3.
Actual Results:  
no additionally added runlevels started at boot.

If I manually start up udev and udev-mount and eg dbus and xdm, rc-status won't show them.

Expected Results:  
I am not sure if it is related to the runlevel bug44588.

I am running archlinux.

I am sorry again, I believe this report can be closed.

The system got slightly messed up with runscript name spaces.

Bug445888 can also be closed, I will post a new patch.

So, the prefix issues seem to be now resolved.

The system boots fine after correcting the already present runlevels' name spaces which still pointed to #!/sbin/runscript.

I am closing this per comment #2.
If there is still an issue, please feel free to reopen.

Thanks,

William
