Vulnerabilities

				All vulnerabilities in the NVD have been assigned a CVE identifier and thus, abide by the 
				definition below.
			

				CVE defines a vulnerability as:
			


					"A weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, 
					when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Mitigation 
					of the vulnerabilities in this context typically involves coding changes, but could also include 
					specification changes or even specification deprecations (e.g., removal of affected protocols or 
					functionality in their entirety)."
				


				The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Program’s primary purpose is to uniquely identify 
				vulnerabilities and to associate specific versions of code bases (e.g., software and shared libraries) to those 
				vulnerabilities. The use of CVEs ensures that two or more parties can confidently refer to a CVE identifier (ID) 
				when discussing or sharing information about a unique vulnerability. For detailed information regarding CVE please
				refer to https://cve.org/ or the CNA Rules at 
				https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/AllResources/CNARules.
