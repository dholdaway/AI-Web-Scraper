Description


Erik Quaeghebeur





          2017-03-04 20:44:55 UTC
        

Doing a world update pulled in dev-python/cvxopt-1.1.9, which failed as follows:

---
[...]
sphinx-build -b html -d build/doctrees   source build/html
Running Sphinx v1.3.1

Extension error:
Could not import extension sphinx.ext.imgmath (exception: No module named 'sphinx.ext.imgmath')
make: *** [Makefile:30: html] Error 1
make: Leaving directory '/var/tmp/portage/dev-python/cvxopt-1.1.9/work/cvxopt-1.1.9/doc'
 * ERROR: dev-python/cvxopt-1.1.9::gentoo failed (compile phase):
 *   emake failed
[...]
---

Perhaps some missing dependency?

Works with sphinx 1.4.4, presumably will work with 1.5.x. The dependency to sphinx should be raised to a minimal version I guess.
