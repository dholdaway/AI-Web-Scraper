Description

Issue: dev-libs/apache-arrow-11.0.0-r2 leaves trace of segfault in dmesg.
Discovered on: amd64 (internal ref: ci)

NOTE:
To reproduce this issue:
1) Install the package with FEATURES=test
2) Check dmesg output with: dmesg -T | grep -E '( segfault | traps:| audit:)'

This type of report comes from a check that is a bit outside of the tinderbox, that's the reason because build.log was not provided (however in cases like these the build.log doesn't help much) but if you need further help to diagnose this issue feel free to ask.

In any case I'm providing what I can see via dmesg.

The test that raise that segfault is testing that the program exit when provided with abnormal input.
So this is wanted
