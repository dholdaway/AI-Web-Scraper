The source package https://dev.gentoo.org/~floppym/dist/${PN}/${P}-gentoo.tar.gz contains a soft-link to /usr/share/automake/COPYING which is very likely to not exists on the installing system. So no licensing information gets installed (and thus nothing is accompanying the installed code, violating §3 GPLv2)

Reproducible: Always

Note that we don't in general install licence files as part of individual packages because we use the LICENSE field instead (and it's part of the repo).

As per https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/License_groups/BINARY-REDISTRIBUTABLE that is a more global and severe defect then, as that makes the result of those packages non-redistributable.

That's not the same as an "explicit inclusion requirement". See the extensive discussion in bug 782841.

AFAICS, the only file licensed under GPL-2+ is missing, and it is neither used nor being installed. Therefore it doesn't belong to the "corresponding source", which means that GPL-2+ should not be listed in the ebuild's LICENSE variable.
https://projects.gentoo.org/qa/policy-guide/other-metadata.html#pg0704

install-sh is under a MIT/X11 license (and is used during build). So the ebuild should be updated to have:

LICENSE="FDL-1.1+ MIT"

Thank you for pointing to https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=782841 , that has been an interesting read indeed. Although I may be in disagreement over some finer points raised there, the issue I raised here seems to be already resolved by the aforementioned ticket.

Should I open a new ticket for the missed MIT license?
