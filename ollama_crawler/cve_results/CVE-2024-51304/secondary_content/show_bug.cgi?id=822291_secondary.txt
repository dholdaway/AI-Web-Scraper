The current stable version also blocks the update of lld.
Thunderbird 78 is also EOL https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Mozilla_Thunderbird

There will be no more releases and they canceled the last expected patch.

So is urgent to stabilize release 91 please!

91 is still being worked on, please give it a bit more time (it's available in ~unstable).

78.13.0 compiles fine for me on a stable system. Please always first disable ccache and sccache when facing build issues. Then try re-building your llvm-rust toolchain if there are mismatches there :\
