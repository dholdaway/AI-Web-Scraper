Description

on boot while trying to mount my lvm i got a message saying
it cant find library libgpm.so ( of course it is in /usr/lib which is on a lv )
so it cannot mount all the fs on my lv ( /usr /tmp /var and /home )
/ and /boot are standard partition

SOLUTION : static link the library in sys-fs/lvm2
echo "sys-fs/lvm2 static" >> /etc/portage/package.use
emerge lvm2

static linking could also be mandatory in the ebuild


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.standard install with /usr on lvm 
2.emerge lvm2
3.reboot 

Actual Results:  
failed to mount all fs on lv

There's already a warning in the lvm2 guide:

"""
Warning: The LVM2 available on the 2005.0 installation CDs is erroneously linked dynamically against a library (libgpm) which resides in /usr. This means you cannot have your /usr in an LVM environment as well. Either install the latest version or version 2.0.33 (not -r1) which are built statically.
