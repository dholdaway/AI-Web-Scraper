I had to drop
epatch "${FILESDIR}"/${PN}-1.5.23b-aixrtl.patch
from sys-devel/libtool-1.5.26.ebuild

(just wondered that libtool-1.5.26 is out)

(In reply to comment #0)
> epatch "${FILESDIR}"/${PN}-1.5.23b-aixrtl.patch

This patched always enabled creating lib.so outside lib.a, independent of having '-brtl' in LDFLAGS.
But the problem is that I've not seen any kind of 'soname'-feature with lib.so.
This only is possible somehow with lib.so inside lib.a.

Because of this I've thought of dropping this patch, but keep runtime-linking (-brtl) enabled in ld-wrapper, as this also works with lib.so inside lib.a.

does this mean we can close this bug because dropping the patch matches your initial intentions to do so?

Ok, lets do so, until it (hopefully not) turns out it doesn't work.
