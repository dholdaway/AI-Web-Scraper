Exhibit 99.1Harte Hanks Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2023 Full-Year Results Project "Elevate" Sales and Marketing Transformation Revamped for Strategic Growth;Anticipate approximately $6 Million in 2024 Cost Reductions, $16 Million over Two Years;Ends Year with $18 Million of Cash and No DebtChelmsford, Massachusetts – March 14, 2024 - Harte Hanks, Inc. (NASDAQ: HHS), a leading global customer experience company focused on bringing companies closer to customers for over 100 years, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023.Kirk Davis, Chief Executive Officer, said: "Project Elevate, the outcome of a comprehensive review of our business in collaboration with newly hired executive sales leadership and respected consultants, is designed to modernize our go-to-market strategy, invest in lead generation, and enable organic growth.  We have added two experienced sales leaders in Kelly Waller, our new SVP of sales and marketing, and Ron Lee, our new SVP of sales services.  These two accomplished sales executives are the ideal people to drive the key components of our organic growth initiatives forward.  More recently, we added additional experienced personnel to lead international sales expansion, grow our newly created partner network, and form our company’s first inside sales division.  These talented people are in place, and we are rapidly improving our marketing programs, value proposition, and pipeline formulation to effectively capitalize on our core competencies and key differentiators.""Over the next few quarters, we will be expanding our enterprise-wide revenue pipeline, participating in numerous high-profile events that facilitate one-to-one meetings with decision makers, and growing a robust partnership network," continued Davis.  "These initiatives are bolstered by a revised incentive structure for our sales team, better alignment between business units, and a clear focus on the SMB and mid-market segments.  We expect these changes will drive consistent pipeline growth and enhance our sales performance over the course of the year.  We’ve accomplished an end-to-end transformation of our sales and marketing strategy and structure, and the team is now in place to drive organic growth.""Simultaneously, we are taking steps, in collaboration with the Kearney Organization, to optimize our cost structure to enable us to invest in sales and marketing without depleting our cash reserves," continued Davis.  "We have identified costs we can eliminate totaling approximately $16 million over next two years with $6 million of savings expected in 2024.  David Fisher, our new Chief Transformation Officer, is working closely with David Garrison, our new Chief Financial Officer, to execute these important changes.""I believe the opportunity for Harte Hanks is significant," concluded Davis.  "Our solutions meet the current and expected needs of customers, and we drive tangible value for clients and their customers.  We can deliver organic growth, expanding the number of logos we work with and deepening our relationship with these customers over time.  We are confident that we can streamline our organization to expand profitability and cash generation as we grow.  The benefits of Project Elevate are expected to become evident in the second half of 2024 and into 2025."
