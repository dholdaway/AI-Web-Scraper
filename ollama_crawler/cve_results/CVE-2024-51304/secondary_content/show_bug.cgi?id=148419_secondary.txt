Please, test that the patch supplied works correctly (test all kmplayer functionalities) when using mplayer-bin under amd64.

I have reported upstream that these harcoded mplayer entries are becoming annoying. Hope they do something about it.

Nevermind, upstream confirmed that mplayer can be set from within the configuration menu from this version and on.

Do the amd64 users still want this patch on this version or should I drop it and add an einfo?

Can you guys still try that the feature works correctly before I perform any change?

------- Additional Comment #2 From Koos Vriezen  2006-09-20 23:18 -------
Have you tried the MPlayer config tab in kmplayer's configure dialog? As of this 0.9.3 release, you should be able to set MPlayer's binary name (and even it's complete path)

Ioannis, can you just go on with the change? I haven't tested it (load of kde deps) but if it doesn't work out, we'll soon notice it. It is testing after all, users can expect minor breakage :)

It's already in the tree. I just wanted to be sure that it worked for everyone. If no one has complained to the moment, maybe things are alright anyway.

MEMORANDUM: Do not create mplayer-bin patch for amd64 on next version.

Sure?

kmplayer-0.9.3.ebuild:

src_unpack() {
    kde_src_unpack

    if use mplayer && use amd64 && ! has_version media-video/mplayer; then
        epatch "${FILESDIR}/${P}-use32bitbin.diff"
    fi
}

I was thinking in allowing the patch in there, but if you insist... :)
