Trying to update coreutils via emerge with FEATURES="${FEATURES} collision-protect" in /etc/make.conf reports the following

existing file /usr/bin/uname is not owned by this package
* This package is blocked because it wants to overwrite
* files belonging to other packages (see messages above).
* If you have no clue what this is all about report it
* as a bug for this package on http://bugs.gentoo.org

package sys-apps/coretutils-6.9-r1 NOT merged

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge -u coreutils
Actual Results:  
coreutils NOT merged

Expected Results:  
coreutils should not report a collision
coreutils should be updated

equery belongs /usr/bin/uname
does not state the package owning the file

/usr/bin/uname is a symlink pointing to /bin/uname
this looks like coreutils 6.9-r1 wants to install uname in /usr/bin by default

Then delete it and move on; no way to fix collisions with orphaned stuff.
