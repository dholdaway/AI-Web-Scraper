Description

The problem: with hplip installed and udev used (pretty standard setup), the /dev/usb/lp0 device is mode 660, owned by root:plugdev. This plugdev is troublesome, because it should be lp to allow printing by cups. This is what hplip's 70-hpmud.rules file was intended for, but it's ineffective.

Solution: will attach a proposed patch which fixes the problem on my system.

70-hpmud.rules.patch

This is a patch against /etc/udev/rules.d/70-hpmud.rules, which is part of net-print/hplip-2.8.6b, the current stable version for amd64.

Let's close it for now and I can reopen in case I detect it again. It's on a machine I don't have remote access to, and rarely access physically.
