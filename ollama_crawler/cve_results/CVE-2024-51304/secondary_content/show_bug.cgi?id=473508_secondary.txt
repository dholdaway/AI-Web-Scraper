E-mail received from William Sutton:

"""
Code Listing 2.15

wget ftp://distfiles.gentoo.org/pub/gentoo/releases/x86/current-stage3/stage3-i686-*.tar.bz2

needs to become

wget ftp://distfiles.gentoo.org/pub/gentoo/releases/x86/current-iso/stage3-i686-*.tar.bz2

apparently they changed the directory structure....
"""

Reproducible: Always
