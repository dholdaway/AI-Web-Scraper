This is not a  bug so nothing is going to be provided for that.  What would like to see is an enhancement to portage for cleaning. Currently the only tool that cleans the system well is  yacleaner, although it is abandoned it seems and third party. Gentoo needs a  command and a script  to clean everything for  example.

# yacleaner --ask --delete --verbose  all

These are the old files that I would delete:

  [ binpkg ]
  [ dist ]      ORBit-0.5.17.tar.bz2  1.1M
  [ dist ]      gnome-libs-1.4.2.tar.bz2  2.8M
  [ dist ]      libgphoto2-2.1.6.tar.gz  3.1M
  [ dist ]      nano-1.3.12.tar.gz  1.2M
  [ dist ]      thunderbird-1.5.0.8-source.tar.bz2  35M
  [ log ]          so and so 
  [ worktmp ]      so and so 

  [ total ]              +42 M

Do you want me to delete these old files? [Yes/No] y

>>> Waiting 5 seconds before starting...
>>> (Control-C + Enter to abort)...
>>> Cleaning in 5 4 3 2 1 

>>> Deleting old files...

 * /usr/portage/packages was already clean.
 * /usr/portage/distfiles cleaned.
 * The $PORT_LOGDIR variable is not set.
 * /var/tmp/portage was already clean.

See  this is  great in terms  for the user?

The current  "clean" leaves lots to be desired.  The script above does not touch the "latest zip, tar, gzip etc  files .

Otherwise great work  what makes  gentoo gentoo.

Use eclean-{dist,pkg} from gentoolkit for cleaning binpkgs/distfiles. For the rest, there's plenty of solutions you can stick into cron; app-admin/tmpwatch even includes a sample cronjob to wipe /tmp, /var/tmp/portage etc.
