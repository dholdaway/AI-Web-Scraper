Description

I've installed roxterm-1.2* and that worked without problem on ppc.  So far, roxterm-1.3.1 also works without problem on ppc.  I have been using many of the packages intended for rox with no problem on ppc.  I would suggest adding the ~ppc arch in addition to x86 and amd64. 

Reproducible: Always
