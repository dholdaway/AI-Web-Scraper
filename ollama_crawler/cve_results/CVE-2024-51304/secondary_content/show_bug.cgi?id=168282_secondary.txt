equery does not show package installed in $ROOT when package with the same name is not installed in /


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. ROOT=/image emerge openssh
install openssh (or other package that is not installed in main system to $ROOT)

Actual Results:  
# ROOT=/image equery l openssh
package is not shown
# ROOT=/image equery l coreutils 
(or other package that is installed in both / and $ROOT)
equery shows package properly


Expected Results:  
# ROOT=/image equery l openssh
should show installed openssh package
