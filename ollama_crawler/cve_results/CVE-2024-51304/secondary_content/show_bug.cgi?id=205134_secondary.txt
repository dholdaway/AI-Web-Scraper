games-emulation/mednafen will fail to build if sys-libs/ncurses was emerge'd with the 'unicode' flag off.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge sys-libs/ncurses with -unicode
2. emerge games-emulation/mednafen

Actual Results:  
The mednafen build fails when attempting to link with the 'ncursesw' library. This library is unavailable.

Expected Results:  
Successful build.

We'll pick this up later with use-based deps.

curses isn't used by mednafen, at least in the latest version.  Builds fine with ncurses built with or without unicode.
