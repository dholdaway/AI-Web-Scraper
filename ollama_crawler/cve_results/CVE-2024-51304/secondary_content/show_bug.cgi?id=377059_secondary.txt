I just can't add an attachment. After trying, supplying the file, description and other inputs, I press Submit and get this error:
You must enter a description for the attachment.
in red background.

I'm trying to attach a file to bug #377053.

Sorry but I can't reproduce that. Please attach a screenshot when this is still an issue.

Bug too old to be reproduced again. I should have had the vision to upload it somewhere and post the link with a screenshot of the form. Anyways, thanks for the feedback.
