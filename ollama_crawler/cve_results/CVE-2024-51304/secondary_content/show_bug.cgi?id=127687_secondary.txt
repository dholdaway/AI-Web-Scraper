there is no gizmo package in the tree.. beside that, media-libs/tiff is already in emul-baselibs:

I actually know that Simon. I am supposed to bring it to the tree.
sam ~ # tar tvfj /usr/portage/distfiles/emul-linux-x86-baselibs-2.5.tar.bz2 |grep tiff
-rwxr-xr-x root/root    327180 2005-12-05 16:46:50 emul/linux/x86/usr/lib/libtiff.so.3.7.3
lrwxrwxrwx root/root         0 2005-09-06 15:41:23 emul/linux/x86/usr/lib/libtiff.so -> libtiff.so.3.7.3
-rwxr-xr-x root/root      8052 2005-12-05 16:47:01 emul/linux/x86/usr/lib/libtiffxx.so.3.7.3
lrwxrwxrwx root/root         0 2005-09-06 15:41:23 emul/linux/x86/usr/lib/libtiff.so.3 -> libtiff.so.3.7.3
lrwxrwxrwx root/root         0 2005-09-06 15:41:31 emul/linux/x86/usr/lib/libtiffxx.so.3 -> libtiffxx.so.3.7.3
lrwxrwxrwx root/root         0 2005-09-06 15:41:31 emul/linux/x86/usr/lib/libtiffxx.so -> libtiffxx.so.3.7.3


and for gizmo:

sam ~ # ldd /usr/bin/gizmo |grep tiff
	libtiff.so.4 => not found

i see... you could have mentioned before that you just need a different version :P

i'm still being dumb: according to the ebuild attached to bug 103587, gizmo requires >=media-libs/tiff-3. That dependency is met with 3.7.3. I even merged the ~amd64 3.7.4, but it doesn't provide a *.so.4 either. What version of tiff do you actually want? 3.7.4 is the most recent in the tree, btw.

From what i could find[1] some distros started naming libtiff greater that 3.6.1 as version 4.

But the number of still missing libs is way to big to solve
humpback@sam /opt/gizmo $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=".:/emul/linux/x86/usr/lib/:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"  ldd ./gizmo |grep found
	libgconf-2.so.4 => not found
	libORBit-2.so.0 => not found
	libglade-2.0.so.0 => not found
	libxml2.so.2 => not found
	libexpat.so.1 => not found
	libdns_sd.so => not found
	libexpat.so.1 => not found
	libcurl.so.3 => not found

many (all?) of these libs are provided by the emul-libs, check http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/base/amd64/emul/content.xml

i assume you have them installed...

I've created a new gizmo ebuild, but I'm missing libgconf-2.so.4 from any emul-linux-x86*.  Is there some reason this isn't shipped in apps-emulation/emul-linux-x86-gtklibs?

This is the only missing library.
