Description

When USE="sqlite" is enabled and an attempt is made to emerge qt, the build will fail during the 
compilation.  This is true for at least 3.3.4r3.  I didn't try the other versions yet, but will attempt to install 
Qt-4.0.0 later for development purposes.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. USE="sqlite" emerge qt
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Build fails during compile.  I then emerged sqlite3 seperately and emerged qt again, build still failed.

Expected Results:  
Qt should have compiled cleanly with either the builtin Qt Sqlite module, or with the installed sqlite library, 
if exists.  Maybe it wants the old version of sqlite installed first?  This might go back to the other "bug" of 
portage to need dependency ranges.

We need some error messages... Post/attach and reopen.

originally, I decided I didn't need sqlite in Qt, so I compiled without it with USE="-sqlite" emerge qt.  That 
fixed my problem.  When I went back to get the error results, I unmerged Qt, then just did 'emerge qt'.  
Portage then emerged unixODBC and then Qt.  When I unmerged Qt to re-install it (I wanted to get the 
error), it merged without problems.  So it seems that when I was emerging KDE, it didn't decide that I 
needed unixODBC before Qt, but when I emerged Qt alone, it went ahead and installed it.  I know that it is 
vague, but I can't reproduce.  Perhaps if I unmerged unixODBC and Qt, it might fail again.  I really need to 
finish compiling KDE though.

Closing until there's a way to reproduce it...
