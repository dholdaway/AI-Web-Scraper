Smells to me like a circular dependency problem due to what metacity-2.13.x RDEPEND wasn't installed before gnome-python-desktop

Not sure if this bug was ever closed out, but I also had a problem with gnome-python this morning.

I needed to reinstall gentoo recently, and I eventually got around to emerging gnome.  It inevitably didn't completely compile.  Eventually (sorry I don't have more info on hand), I discovered the failure in "emerge gnome" was at "gnome-python".  I also noticed gnome-python was trying to compile before python was.  Emerging python first solved the gnome-python problem.


This install was using the March 10 stage3 and portage tarball, although I ran "emerge --sync" and "emerge portage" immediatly.  The current version of portage on my machine is "2.1.2.7" (from "emerge -pv portage".  No USE flags or LINGUAS are enabled).  Since I see it above, my MAKEOPTS="-j3".  This is on an Athlon dual core 64 bit machine.

gnome-python-2.16.2
python-2.4.4-r4

This bug is now over a year old.  If this is still reprodicible, please reopen.  Marking as WORKSFORME as I cant see a circular depend.
