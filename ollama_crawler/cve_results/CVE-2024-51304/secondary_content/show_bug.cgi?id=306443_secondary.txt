I have used an old stage3 with glibc-2.9
installed the binary multilib glibc-2.9
tried to compile multilib gcc

and I get this error

checking for suffix of object files... configure: error: cannot compute suffix of object files: cannot compile

As Tiago already explained you through mail, this is pretty much unsupported.

Nevertheless an user asked for an updated stage3 and i did one last month: http://dev.gentoo.org/~armin76/stage3-sparc64-20100111.tar.bz2

Nevertheless you should consider using Debian for the purpose of your machines, since thats what the farm users and admins are used to.

the reason for the old stage3 was so that i could install the pre-compiled multilib glibc with out the need to downgrade

With the following use flags "nls nptl openmp" multilib gcc434 will compile
One of the following flags "fortran gcj mudflap objc" is causing the error
I will now compile a biarch glibc210 and then work out which flag is causing the error

I'm marking this as "worksforme" on a 2008 stage3
It didn't compile on any of my more up to date systems
I havnt yet tried to recompile again on the newer systems
