looks like the point of failure is at:

  CCLD   libpolkit-gtk-1.la
/bin/grep: /usr/lib/libpixman-1.la: No such file or directory
/bin/sed: can't read /usr/lib/libpixman-1.la: No such file or directory
libtool: link: `/usr/lib/libpixman-1.la' is not a valid libtool archive


pixman is installed on my system, I re-emerged pixman and then polkit-gnome, but no change.

 ~ # eix pixman
[I] x11-libs/pixman
     Available versions:  0.20.2 {altivec mmx neon sse2 static-libs}
     Installed versions:  0.20.2(22:57:12 04/11/11)(-altivec -mmx -neon -sse2 -static-libs)

Have you tried "lafilefixer --justfixit" and then try to install polkit-gnome again?

If you don't have lafilefixer, emerge lafilefixer

lafilefixer was not installed, so I emerged it. then:
   
   lafilefixer --justfixit

After that, gnome-extra/polkit-gnome-0.99 successfully installed.

Thank you.
