Description

Whenever I am in Upgradable packages view and I reload database, the progress bar stops at 89% and Porthole freezes.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Show upgradable packages
2. Reload database or emerge something
3.

Actual Results:  
Porthole freezes.  It does not give any errors.


Expected Results:  
Reload database and show upgradable packages.

I reported it on Gentoo forums a while ago:
http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-302285-highlight-porthole.html
Suggested temporary solution (switch to All Packages view) does not seem to work
for me.
When I press upgrade and then NO on the message "Upgrade all
your packages in world" it freezes.
Also when I go back to "Upgradable packages" view it freezes.
It seems that Porthole can not calculate upgradable packages
twice.

Also I see that "emerge <defunct>" remains in memory (ps -A)
after an emerge. Even after emerge -p.

This problem seems to be disappeared with latest upgrade of Python.
