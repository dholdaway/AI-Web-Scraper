Screenshot of the running plasma-nm applet

I emerge plasma-meta with the networkmanager use flag, which pulled in plasma-nm:5. When I click on the applet, it doesn't show a list of networks, and also the hover text is a bit strange.

I attached a screenshot of how it looks like. There is essentially an unlabelled checkbox and a settings button which opens the connection manager. The hover text is:

Networks
<qt>Wifi: Connected to SSIDNAMEGOESHERE</qt>
