Description

The configure phase of guarddog checks for mcopidl - a configuration program
that comes with arts, and crashes if it doesn't find it.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Remove (or never install) arts from your system
2.  USE="-arts" emerge guarddog


Actual Results:  
Compile fails.

Expected Results:  
This check should never be performed if you're not using Arts.  Otherwise, arts
should be listed as a requirement for this (but it's a firewall program, so it
actually shouldn't).

Well, the configure script checks if it should search for mcopidl or not and
`USE="-arts" emerge guarddog` runs fine here.

Rusty, how exactly does it crash? Can you provide relevant output, and the 
config.log file from the workdir?

Actually, it was failing during the check for mcopidl during the configure run.

After a massive number of system changes, however, I can no longer reproduce
this bug.

It configures fine now without arts, and I have no idea why.

Neither do we :-) Please reopen if it appears again.
