We continue to expect our Free Cash Flow in the first quarter of 2024 will be negative, given the seasonality timing of our Accrued Merchant Payables as we exit the Q4 holiday season.Cautionary Disclaimer StatementThe Company intends to provide a detailed operational and financial update during its fourth quarter and full-year 2023 earnings call in March 2024. Closing procedures for the fiscal quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, are not yet complete. The updated and reaffirmed outlook (the “Outlook”) and preliminary financial information discussed in this press release are based on management’s preliminary, unaudited analysis of financial results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023.  The Outlook is an estimate based on information available to management as of the date of this release and  subject to change as a result of the completion of the Company’s standard financial and operating closing procedures and customary audit procedures. As of the date of this press release, the company has not completed its financial statement closing process for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, and the company’s independent registered accounting firm has not audited the preliminary financial data discussed in this press release.  As we complete our quarter and year end close process and finalize our financial statements for the quarter, it is possible that we may identify items that require adjustments to the Outlook and preliminary financial information set forth above, and those changes could be material.

 Inside Groupon, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
In future measurements of fair value, adverse changes in assumptions could result in impairments of goodwill or long-lived assets that would require non-cash charges to the Consolidated Statements of Operations and those charges could have a material effect on our financial condition and operating results.



 Other - Other   Highlight
However, such assumptions are inherently uncertain and actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

 Other - Other   Highlight
However, such assumptions are inherently uncertain and actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

 Other - Other   Highlight
If actual refunds or redemptions differ from our estimates, the effects could be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Legal - Other   Highlight
For example, our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where it has lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where it has higher statutory rates, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, by changes in the measurement of uncertain tax positions, by changes affecting transfer pricing or by changes in the relevant laws, regulations, principles and interpretations.
