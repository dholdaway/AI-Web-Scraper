Hi guys!
I am using this tool for my live distro. Added to default runlevel (with x-setup) it recognize anything, but doesn't update the mouse section in xorg.conf.
No problem with nvidia and monitor, but the mouse doesn't work.Both with cat /dev/input/mice and with gpm, the mouse works, but not in kde.
I am running kernel 2.6.16 and udev 090.

Thanks
Luca

Well, considering autoconfig has nothign to do with the mouse detection, I'm not sure why you think it does.  Instead, mkxf86config does all of the xorg.conf stuff.

Please post your non-working xorg.conf file as an attachment to this bug, as it works perfectly for me.

This *is* on a LiveCD, not your actual installed machine, correct?

Also, please attach /etc/sysconfig/gentoo to this bug.

No response, and it works for me perfectly on everything I've tried.
