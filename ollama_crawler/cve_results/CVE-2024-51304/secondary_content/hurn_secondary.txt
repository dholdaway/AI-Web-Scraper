 Inside Huron Consulting Group Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
However, final determinations of prior year tax positions upon settlement with the taxing authority could be materially different from estimates.



 Other - Other   Highlight
In addition, we considered various factors, including macroeconomic conditions, relevant industry and market trends for each reporting unit, and other entity-specific events, that could indicate a potential change in the fair value of our reporting units or the composition of their carrying values.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities resulting from changes in the estimates or assumptions could materially impact the financial statements.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Our utilization rate can be negatively affected by increased hiring because there is generally a transition period for new professionals that results in a temporary drop in our utilization rate.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Any significant decline in our operations could result in non-cash goodwill impairment charges.
