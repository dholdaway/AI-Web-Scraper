https://github.com/tcltk/tcl/blob/main/license.terms states "...and that this
notice is included verbatim in any distributions.". It is not included during installation and thus the result is not conforming to the license as other files refer to it by name:
"
 * Copyright (c) 1991-1994 The Regents of the University of California.
 * Copyright (c) 1994-1997 Sun Microsystems, Inc.
 *
 * See the file "license.terms" for information on usage and redistribution of
 * this file, and for a DISCLAIMER OF ALL WARRANTIES.
"



Reproducible: Always

We do include the file as licenses/tcltk in the Gentoo repository.

Not sure why "referring to it by name" would be important. These notices are only visible in the unpacked source where the file is present.

Include files (e.g. /usr/include/tcl.h) refer to the named file.

Since you already pointed to https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=782841 in https://bugs.gentoo.org/911848 I do not know if that is something that is to be fixed here. So you may resolve the ticket with WONTFIX.

Well, even if we did install it, it wouldn't be in /usr/include/license.terms. IMHO the wording of upstream's license notice is a little unfortunate, because it only makes sense in the context of the source package. 

In any case, thank you for reporting. (I'd rather see some false positive reports, than miss a real license issue.)
