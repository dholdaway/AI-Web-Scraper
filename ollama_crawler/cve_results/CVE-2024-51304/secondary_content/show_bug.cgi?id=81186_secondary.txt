When trying to install knetscan from portage i get this error:

( ... )
configure: error: The important program mcopidl was not found!
Please check whether you installed KDE correctly.
!!! ERROR: net-analyzer/knetscan-1.0 failed.
!!! Function kde_src_compile, Line 141, Exitcode 1
!!! died running ./configure, kde_src_compile:configure
( ... )

I have kde-base/kde-3.3.2 Installed, and it seems that there is no mcopidl !:(




Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge knetscan
2.
3.

The missing mcopidl comes from arts.
$ qpkg -f -v `which        mcopidl `
kde-base/arts-1.3.2 *
