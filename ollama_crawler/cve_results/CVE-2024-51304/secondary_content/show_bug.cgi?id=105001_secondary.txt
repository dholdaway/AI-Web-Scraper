currently some pre-ftpbase versions of ftp servers are listed as blocks in
DEPEND for ftpbase-0.00. But it should be no problem at all to /build/ the
package with those other servers around, as long as you don't /install/ it. If
you moved those dependencies to RDEPEND, people could make binary packages for
ftpbase and their favorite ftpd and only after all this is completed start
unmerging the old version and merging the new one, resulting in less downtime.

I know this is a minor issue, but as the fix is equally minor, maybe someone
will add this letter to the ebuild.

Not really, AFAIK. Portage treats them the same; vsftpd and proftpd has ftpbase
in RDEPEND and it does not solve anything. But yeah, technically this belongs to
RDEPEND.

Stale bug, doesn't matter at all now.
