!!! When you file a bug report, please include the following information:
GENTOO_VM=  CLASSPATH="." JAVA_HOME=""
JAVACFLAGS="-source 1.3 -target 1.3" COMPILER=""
and of course, the output of emerge --info

The error message is misleading as /etc/portage/modules is world readable.

Remove userpriv from FEATURES in make.conf, package emerges fine.

Reproducible: Always

Note: userpriv has been working with many other packages, until this one. What is it doing? 

Further tweaking shows that if I made everything under /etc/portage world readable, the package emerges fine.

depend-java-query is calling into the Portage code because it needs to handle use flags in DEPEND atoms and this does not seem to work with FEATURES="userpriv"

You need to give the portage group read permission to all the portage config files if you want to use userpriv.

Loosening the permissions for /etc/portage/modules should fixed this.
