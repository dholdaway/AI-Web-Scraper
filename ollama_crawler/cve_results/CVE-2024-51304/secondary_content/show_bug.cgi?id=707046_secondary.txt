Description

I recently reported that many ROS packages lack python 3 support. This is one example of how I came to that impression. I can see that the ebuild has:

PYTHON_COMPAT=( python{2_7,3_6} pypy3 )

And I have:
# grep PYTHON_TARGETS /etc/portage/make.conf
PYTHON_TARGETS="python2_7 python3_6"

But:

# emerge genmsg -av
These are the packages that would be merged, in order:

Calculating dependencies... done!
[ebuild   R    ] dev-ros/genmsg-0.5.12::gentoo  USE="-test" PYTHON_TARGETS="python2_7" 0 KiB

Other packages (i.e. those that don't use the ros-catkin eclass) work as expected. I also have some ROS packages which DO use both PYTHON_TARGETS. Really not sure what is going wrong here...

I get this:

[ebuild   R    ] dev-ros/genmsg-0.5.12::gentoo  USE="-test" PYTHON_TARGETS="python3_6" 0 KiB



You probably modified ros-catkin.eclass. Please provide emerge --info and reopen.

Wow. Indeed I had some old ros-catkin.eclass lying around I had been tinkering with a while ago. Many thanks, and apologies for the time wasted.
