Had a look at this because of the PR, but neither of us actually managed to reproduce even with -native-symlinks.

I see this used a llvm/clang toolchain, but doing the same didn't change anything.

Considering (current) line 46 isn't interesting I think this was either fixed by something else or triggered by a specific way to setup toolchain variables (if this comes up again, I'll likely need the env file).
