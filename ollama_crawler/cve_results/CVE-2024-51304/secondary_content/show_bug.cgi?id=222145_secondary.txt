dspam-3.8.0-r11
x86_64

I got this message when attempting to install dspam. I have both slots of
sqlite (2.8.16-r4 $ 3.5.6) installed. I think it doesn't know how to select the
one it needs.

checking SQLite header version... 3.5.6
checking how to link SQLite libraries... failure
configure: error: Required version of libsqlite not found

!!! Please attach the following file when seeking support:
!!! /var/tmp/portage/mail-filter/dspam-3.8.0-r11/work/dspam-3.8.0/config.log

For some reason, the configure script fails to create the ${S}/libtool script. Can you find the cause of that?
