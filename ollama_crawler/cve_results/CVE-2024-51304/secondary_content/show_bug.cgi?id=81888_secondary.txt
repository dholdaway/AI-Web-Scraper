One of the examples says:

tar -cjf foo.tar.bz2 bar/
              create  bzipped  tar  archive  of  the  directory   foo   called
              foo.tar.bz2

It should of course be:

tar -cjf foo.tar.bz2 bar/
              create  bzipped  tar  archive  of  the  directory   bar   called
              foo.tar.bz2


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. s/foo/bar in the second line ;)
2.
3.
