Description

A newly created third mail account is not shown (all IMAP). If I go to
Evolution Preferences and enable first the old, working account and then the new one, the new one is not shown but the title of the old one instead changes to the name of the new account. But still all folders of the old account remain with all those messages.

Sorry but I don't know how to better describe the problem.

Thank you for report, Andreas. I did not manage to reproduce the behavior you described in evolution-2.8.3. I've created three accounts enabled/disabled them and everything seems to work. Can you reproduce the problem with the evolution-2.8.3?

Me too, I wasn't able to reproduce it with evolution 2.8. So maybe we can regard the issue as being resolved?
