/etc/init.d/nfsmount uses killall to determine if rpc.statd is running, but the ebuild net-fs/nfs-utils which provides nfsmount does not RDEPEND on sys-process/psmisc which provides killall.

If psmisc has not been otherwise installed nfsmount fails to mount NFS shares.

sys-process/psmisc is in base profile, so should be present pretty much on every system, unless you are using some weird profile. If that's the case, then indicate so here; you neglected to post emerge --info output).

I had an issue with rsync exclude list (profiles/*/packages got ignored while only portage/packages for bin-pkgs should be ignored) so the addition of psmisc to system never reached my portage tree.

But I would think it is cleaner to set dependecies in the ebuild rather then "depending" on contents of system... In case of removals from system, dependencies will still remain correct, and there should never be problems with minimalist profiles
