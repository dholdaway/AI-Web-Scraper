build log

Trying to re-merge dev-python/networkx-1.11 (not sure what part of my world update triggered this rebuild) I get an error building the documentation:

atlas.py  FAIL: This example needs Graphviz and either PyGraphviz or PyDotPlus
circular_tree.py  FAIL: This example needs Graphviz and either PyGraphviz or PyDotPlus

Indeed, neither dev-python/pygraphviz nor dev-python/pydotplus is installed on my system. Nor is either of these listed as a dependency in the ebuild.

Those are optional dependencies, and are only pulled in with USE=examples.

The docs build failed due to bug 594626.
