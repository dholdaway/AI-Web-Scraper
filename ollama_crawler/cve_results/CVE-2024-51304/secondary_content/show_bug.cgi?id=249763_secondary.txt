When I try to emerge "app-emulation/vmware-modules-1.0.0.15-r1" program I experienced such a mask type isn't in the Gentoo Handbook! Please take information about this to the Gentoo Handbook as the other masked 'modes'! 

- app-emulation/vmware-modules-1.0.0.15-r1 (masked by: corruption)

Thanks!

Reproducible: Always

This is the case, that doesn't happen in a sane ebuild, that's either edited by the user or committed broken. If latter is the case please file a specific bug for the package and that should be handled by the maintainer.

Thanks.

Edited summary before it gets "accidentally" assigned to docs-team

Thank for your reply!

Ok you're saying this, but i wouldn't know from the gentoo handbook, if you hadn't said that!

I thought that it can contain a few (max. 2-3) raws in the handbook what you wrote in your comment! The user must know the error is by him!

Thanks!

Typically you will see a digest verification error message prior to the "masked by: corruption" message. Did you see a digest verification error message or not?
