Well, nothing new here. It's the same problem as we already fixed in the bug #365481

I guess the format of "gconftool-2 -R /apps/panel/applets" output has changed again and we need to update the patch.

Hm.. Somehow, I have a list of cities specified in
  /apps/panel/applets/clock_screen0/prefs

but it's empty in Clock Preferences.

I've fixed the problem but re-adding it and it's in the following tree now:
   /apps/panel/applets/applet_8/prefs


Sorry for the noise.
