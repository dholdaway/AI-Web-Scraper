A number of genes specifically expressed in B cells contain Oct-2-binding sites in their regulatory regions. However, the analysis of expression levels of these genes in Oct-2-deficient B cells revealed that they were unaffected. Hence, there were no genes known that critically depend on Oct-2 for their expression. To understand the molecular basis for the Oct-2 effect on B-cell development, we searched for Oct-2 target genes by subtractive cDNA cloning. We show here that expression of the murine CD36 gene in B cells and macrophages requires a functional Oct-2 protein. Nuclear run-on experiments demonstrate that this gene is regulated transcriptionally by Oct-2. Moreover, CD36 levels correlated with the levels of Oct-2 expression in several mouse B-cell and macrophage cell lines. Finally, compared to wild-type and heterozygous mice, CD36 mRNA levels were markedly reduced in spleens and B-cell-enriched splenocyte fractions from oct-2-/- mice. The data identify CD36 as the first target gene critically dependent on Oct-2 for its expression. Because CD36 expression is also dependent on Oct-2 in vivo, it is a candidate gene through which Oct-2 could affect B-cell differentiation.genesdev.cshlp.orgShow moreShow lessSave Cite Cited by 96 Related articles All 6 versions  PrivacyTermsHelpAbout ScholarSearch help
