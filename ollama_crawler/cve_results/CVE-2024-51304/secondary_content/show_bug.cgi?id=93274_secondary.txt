Description


Eric Pretorious





          2005-05-19 17:11:04 UTC
        

Code Listing 10.9 ("Translating to sysctl.conf") of The Gentoo Linux Security 
Guide  
(http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gentoo-security.xml) does not address adding the 
iterative loop of Code Listing 10.7 ("Enable reverse path filtering") to 
sysctl.conf 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
N/A  
Actual Results:  
N/A  

Expected Results:  
N/A 

No direction is given in `man sysctl.conf` either.

that's because the conf subdir has as many subdirs as your system has interfaces

besides, we assume the user has some level of competence to figure it out
themselves ... in other words, i dont think it's worth addressing

I disagree, generally, and believe that all of the various commands should be 
assembled together in one section (i.e., Code Listing 10.9) in order to 
clarify your somewhat-ambiguous directions regarding sysctl.conf. (If *I* 
can't understand it at first glance, I doubt that many novice-intermediate 
users will be able to either.)

Actually the loop is plain easy to "resolve" to the sysctl.conf. Just see what *
is substituted with (it's plain shell expansion) and use that.

Then why don't you put that into the documentation? (I'm only trying to make 
Gentoo more usable for more people - instead of claiming the moral 
high-ground.)

Any proposal on how to put it in the text?

Sorry, I'm going to mark this one as WORKSFORME again. It really isn't hard to
understand how sysctl.conf works with the information in the guide. If we would
explain a bash loop in a security guide, chances are we need to explain a lot
more than this.

If anything, we can only refer to the Bash documentation available elsewhere.
