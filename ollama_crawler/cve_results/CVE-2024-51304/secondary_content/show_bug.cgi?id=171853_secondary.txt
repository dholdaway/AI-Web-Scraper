Description

Xorg does not listen by default on port 6000, but sometimes this is wanted by the user.
This can be changed by replacing the line:
defaultserverargs="-nolisten tcp -br"

with 

defaultserverargs="-br"

in /usr/bin/startx. The patch introduces a new useflag so that you don't have to edit /usr/bin/startx every time you've build X.ORG

The patch is easy to understand and (of course) verified to work.

Eh, ever tried to use ~/.xserverrc (or /etc/X11/xinit/xserverrc) ?
