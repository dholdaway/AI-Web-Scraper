ls: cannot access /usr/share/webapps/cacti/0.8.6j-r3/htdocs/lib/adodb/: No such file or directory


so since the adodb directory is missing out of lib, when i try to login to the cacti web page i see this:

Warning: include(/var/www/localhost/htdocs/cacti/lib/adodb/adodb.inc.php) [function.include]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /var/www/localhost/htdocs/cacti/include/config.php on line 150

Warning: include() [function.include]: Failed opening '/var/www/localhost/htdocs/cacti/lib/adodb/adodb.inc.php' for inclusion (include_path='.:/usr/share/php5:/usr/share/php') in /var/www/localhost/htdocs/cacti/include/config.php on line 150

Fatal error: Call to undefined function NewADOConnection() in /var/www/localhost/htdocs/cacti/lib/database.php on line 40


Reproducible: Always

Uhm, it's not missing any files, the ebuild won't install the bundled adodb stuff unless you have USE=bundled-adodb set. More like you failed to run etc-update so you still have old library_path set in include/config.php.

jeeze jakub, did you dog die today or something?

you figured out the problem. only thing is- include/config.php is protected so that webapp-config won't replace it on a whim.


really though, there's no need to be so snarky.
