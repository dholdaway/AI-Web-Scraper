Description

Steps to reproduce (on a stable system):

1. emerge -av gammu python-gammu wammu
2. Run wammu. It works fine.
3. ACCEPT_KEYWORDS=~x86  emerge -av gammu  # Or add it to /etc/portage/package.keywords
4. Run wammu. This error message is printed:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/wammu", line 48, in ?
    import Wammu.App
  File "/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/Wammu/App.py", line 23, in ?
    import Wammu.Main
  File "/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/Wammu/Main.py", line 59, in ?
    import Wammu.MailWriter
  File "/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/Wammu/MailWriter.py", line 32, in ?
    import gammu
SystemError: Runtime libGammu version does not match compile time version (runtime: 1.07.00, compiletime: 1.05.00)

Running revdep-rebuild does not fix the problem. We need to manually re-emerge python-gammu to fix this.

Expected behavior:
Portage (or revdep-rebuild) should be able to fix that.

Either upgrade both or none. They can't depend on each other, creating circular dependencies.

I understand that. But isn't there any other solution? Not even on revdep-rebuild?

revdep-rebuild is not for python stuff, sorry. Wouldn't solve version mismatch anyway, it can't guess, it can only re-emerge stuff :)

No solution here until portage handles circular dependencies (Bug 16365).
