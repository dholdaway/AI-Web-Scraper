it is not possible to compile ffmpeg-0.4.9_p20070616 with swscale-support, so there is no /usr/lib/libswscale.so and therefore you can't emerge applications like blender (i tried it with version 2.45).

in this german forum there is a patch which adds a "swscale" USE-flag to the ffmpeg-ebuild attached to dyle's post.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge ffmpeg-0.4.9_p20070616
2. try emerging blender-2.45 with the "ffmpeg" USE-flag set
Actual Results:  
emerging blender (just as an example for any application needing libswscale which should come with ffmpeg) fails with the message by ld that "-lswscale" cannot be found.

Expected Results:  
blender should have been compiled an installed.

FYI: The ffmpeg subversion ebuild in berkano overlay does have a swscaler useflag.
