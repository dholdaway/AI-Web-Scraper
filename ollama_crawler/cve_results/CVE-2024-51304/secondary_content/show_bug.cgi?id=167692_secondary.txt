If you upload a file via apache or install a component through a cms using their own installer (apache process creates files and dirs) all files have permissions 600 and directories 700 instead of 644 and 755 which are needed to work correct.

FIX: Edit /etc/suphp.conf and change
;Umask to set, specify in octal notation
umask=0077

to
umask=0022



Reproducible: Always




using chtekk's syscp-1.3.13 overlay ebuild

Eh, I fail to see any bug here. You are responsible for configuring your server as needed for your particular configuration; noone will do your job.

If you see it that way it is not bug. If the ebuild should work out of the box with under most common circumstances it does not work with default config. Fact is that with default config any file created by apache process is not accessible by apache itself anymore. So imho it is a bug and is not a particular config but a common config requirement for shared hosting environments. Just my 0.02 -.-
