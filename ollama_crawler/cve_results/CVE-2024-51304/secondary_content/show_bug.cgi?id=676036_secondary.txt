it needs openjdk-bin to be installed for the first time to compile, later you can get rid of openjdk-bin and use openjdk to compile openjdk =).

if you unmasked/keyworded only openjdk, you also need to do that for openjdk-bin.

Closing, feel free to reopen and provide some output if it still fails for you.
