Bullet comes with a lot of demo programs, which should be installed with the "examples" USE flag. As it stands, the source code for them is installed in /usr/share/doc/bullet-2.77/examples/Demos, but the programs themselves are not compiled. They also cannot be compiled (at least not easily) from here - they're intended to be built at the same time as the library.

It looks like replacing line 25 of the ebuild will work:
    -DBUILD_DEMOS=OFF
should be
    $(cmake-utils_use_build examples DEMOS)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge sci-physics/bullet-2.77 with +examples
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Demo programs are not built.

Expected Results:  
Demo programs should be built.

Unfortunately this would require more work. Dependencies are not explicit and the cmake files appeared to be buggy. If someone steps in and provides a patch, I would be fine including it.

It would be helpful for me to have the demo programs. Would it be possible to:

1)build only the non-buggy non dependent Demos

2) provide a masked version of the ebuild that just tries to compile the Demos. (I thought the Demos were designed to just compile with the rest of the source)

3) Suggest a way of compiling the demos otherwise.

@Sébastien Fabbro
Could the following line be added to the ebuild?

>$(cmake-utils_use_use double-precision DOUBLE_PRECISION)

Could you explain what is the rationale behind that? Is it something to deal with the demo programs?

@Sébastien Fabbro

The double precision option has nothing to do with the demos, it is just a use flag that would be very helpful for bullet ( and is one that ODE has).

Should I file a seperate bug report for that?

i've added the double-precision flag. tried again with the demos on, but still very buggy, so either a patch is welcome or someone tries to convince upstream to get the proper dependencies for the demos.
thanks.

I would be interested in having the bullet double precision use flag even without demos enabled.

I am assuming that the double precision is not causing the demos to be buggy and it is the demo install process that is being refered to in you post?

closing this bug - not really sure if that needs more work than it is now. feel free to re-open with a concrete solution.
thanks.
