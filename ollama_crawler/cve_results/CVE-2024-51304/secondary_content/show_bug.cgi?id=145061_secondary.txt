The dhcpcd does not fork into background which breaks Gentoo init scripts.

For one, no services that depend on network would start.

dhcpcd 2.0.5-r1

Thanks, this is exactly an example how bugs should not look like. Works fine here. 

Reopen if you care to actually provide some information to debug the problem (and try 2.0.8-r3 first).

hmm, it is unusable when compiled with debug.

Very nice package :)
