Description

With rox-base/volume-009-r1, attempting to start the volume applet results in an error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib64/rox/Volume/AppletRun", line 12, in ?
    main = volume.Volume(1)
  File "/usr/lib64/rox/Volume/volume.py", line 55, in __init__
    self.vertical = self.get_panel_orientation() in ('Right', 'Left')
  File "/usr/lib64/rox/Volume/volume.py", line 165, in get_panel_orientation
    pos = self.socket.property_get('_ROX_PANEL_MENU_POS', 'STRING', False)
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'property_get'

after which the volume applet exits. This is separate from the primary AppRun ... program, which works great.

I'm unsure if any required libs are missing. I have all the latest KDE libraries to run the latest (stable) kdevelop on amd64, as well as the latest rox-filer and all dependancies. If a lib is missing, I think it would be an error in the ebuild, but I have no idea if it needs anything extra :-/

Reproducible: Always

Certainly odd, I've never run into this problem.

Just to double-check: Are you dragging this app to a Rox panel or a KDE panel?  It looks to me like the problem is somewhere in rox-lib where it interfaces with the panel.

I honestly can't seem to reproduce this, I'll need your help to fix this bug.

Please re-open if you can reproduce it with rox-2.6.1 and rox-lib-2.0.4, thanks!

Also don't forget to tell me:
 - What version of rox-lib
 - What version of rox
 - Output of 'emerge --info'

Thank you!

Closing as "Works for me"
