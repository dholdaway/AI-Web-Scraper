I'm attempting to convert to hardened / selinux using the instructions at http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/hardened/selinux/selinux-handbook.xml?part=2&chap=1. At "Code Listing 2.3: Update your Gentoo Linux system," `emerge -uDN world`:

mpicc -std=gnu99 -march=native -O2 -pipe -pthread   -DHAVE_CONFIG_H  -I../../easel -I../../easel -I. -I.. -I. -I../../src -c mpi.c

OMG this is an old bug.  Close it, please, unless someone has it as a problem still...
