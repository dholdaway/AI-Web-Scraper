the log shows chromium looks for libpng12.so.0, but it is not exit as libpng1.2 is not installed, libpng1.4 installed but it is not linked to libpnt1.4

I believe this is a problem with the ebuild in 333579.

Interesting. Even then, it shouldn't crash the browser... if we confirm that's indeed the problem from bug #333579, we should report this upstream.

it seems google-talkplugin ebuild in 33357 might be the cause.

Could you please report it upstream and post the link here? No plugin should be able to crash Chrome.

I am having the same problem on amd64:

$ chromium  
Attempting to load libmoonloaderxpi 
sh: /usr/lib64/nspluginwrapper/i386/linux/npviewer: No such file or directory
Inconsistency detected by ld.so: dl-open.c: 612: _dl_open: Assertion `_dl_debug_initialize (0, args.nsid)->r_state == RT_CONSISTENT' failed!

It started today after I did some updates to my system. The majority of the updates were the KDE 4.5.2 packages. Another notible (and possibly related) update was libpng 1.4.4.

I tried deleting my ~/.config/chromium, but the only thing that did was show a menu at start asking which search engine I wanted to use and after making a selection, chromium crashes.

I wonder... does it also happen when you launch chromium with --disable-plugins commandline switch?

That might be a clue. Does the problem persist after re-emerging chromium? Please try --disable-plugins first though. I've noticed there are cases where chromium can crash when loading a plugin.

That's also a good observation. It'd seem to indicated that chromium crashes when loading a plugin. If the chromium binary itself wouldn't have consistent linking, it would crash before displaying the dialog.

I have tried using both --disable-plugins and --disable-extensions with no significant change in the situation. The only change I have observed is that the "sh: /usr/lib64/nspluginwrapper/i386/linux/npviewer: No such file or directory" message usually does not appear. I am not sure what I did to trigger it, but when I first started troubleshooting this, it was not there and after I finished troubleshooting it, it was gone. It only appeared when I was trying to diagnose the cause of the issue.

I have run revdep-rebuild on the system and it claims that all of the dynamic links are consistent. I have also tried going back to older versions of chromium, but the problem persists with them.

I have tried the following versions:

www-client/chromium-7.0.517.8
www-client/chromium-7.0.517.24
www-client/chromium-7.0.536.2
www-client/chromium-7.0.536.2-r1

Interesting. Could you file a good upstream bug report about that (http://new.crbug.com) and post the link here?

If you have a while, it would be interesting to see if the problem also reproduces with a version from 5.x series. I guess it would reproduce.

The latest version of chromium seems to have semi-fixed this. I tried starting chromium after an emerge and it crashed, but I could see the window. I tried again and it actually started:

$ chromium 
Attempting to load libmoonloaderxpi 
Inconsistency detected by ld.so: dl-open.c: 612: _dl_open: Assertion `_dl_debug_initialize (0, args.nsid)->r_state == RT_CONSISTENT' failed!

This behavior appears to repeat, so the issue is already fixed, although those error messages are an issue.

I am very busy with offline work, so I have not had a chance to file an upstream bug report. Would you still like me to file it when I get a chance?

Ignore what I just posted. =www-client/chromium-7.0.544.0 crashes whenever I try to view a JPEG in its own tab, so an upstream bug report is still needed. I will try to make time to file one with as much detail as soon as I have code written to meet some offline deadlines.

Sorry, just noticed I not post output of firefox:
Gtk-Message: Failed to load module "gnomebreakpad": libgnomebreakpad.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Inconsistency detected by ld.so: dl-open.c: 612: _dl_open: Assertion `_dl_debug_initialize (0, args.nsid)->r_state == RT_CONSISTENT' failed!

Those error messages are about sync:

Yes, please.

Yes, I mean www-client/chromium-7.0.544.0. I have a backup of my ~/.config/chromium directory that I had restored when I had those issues with www-client/chromium-7.0.544.0. I have given www-client/chromium-7.0.544.0 the same treatment that I had given to the previous versions and I can reproduce the assertion failures that were occurring on start. The only change is that I need to navigate to specific web pages to get the assertion failure to occur. Running chromium with --disable-plugins makes those pages immune to failure, but it is still possible for me to crash the browser by visiting "chrome://plugin", at which point the same assertion failure occurs.

I have filed the bug report you requested:

http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=58510

I tried to provide every detail I thought would be helpful. The only thing I did not do was provide an strace. My time is limited, so because of time constraints, I am going to wait until someone asks me to provide an strace under certain conditions so that I do not waste my time producing an strace that likely will not be useful.

It would have taken longer before I filed that bug report, but my web browser issues I am having are not isolated to chromium and other web browsers on my system are also experiencing issues, which makes this more than a simple annoyance that I can easily workaround. Interestingly, I have x86 (32-bit) system (i.e. my laptop) that has a similar software configuration and it is experiencing no issues.

On my amd64 desktop, Konqueror is experiencing the same assertion error that Chromium experiences and I mentioned that in the upstream bug report. Firefox has no assertion error that I can reproduce, but loading gmail caused its GUI to stall for at least 10 seconds and scripts on other web pages caused GUI stalls as well. I recompiled firefox and xulrunner without ipc and installed noscript to try to reduce the overhead that I assumed was causing issues. With those changes in place, Firefox is now in a usable state where the GUI will not stall in an obvious manner and I can get my work done.

I have discovered the cause of this issue. The media-libs/libpng-1.4.4 update on October 6, somehow corrupted libpng:1.2. Running "emerge -1v libpng:1.2" fixes the issue.

Had same issue (www-client/chromium-6.0.472.63-r1 and www-client/chromium-7.0.517.24 crashed on start saying
Inconsistency detected by ld.so: dl-open.c: 612: _dl_open: Assertion `_dl_debug_initialize (0, args.nsid)->r_state == RT_CONSISTENT' failed!
and www-client/firefox-3.6.9-r1 crashed with same message on loading some pages (for example, google's bug with link to this bug)). I'm writing this message from elinks...
It turned out that for some reason I haven't /usr/lib/libpng12.so.0, although have media-libs/libpng-1.2.44 installed. I rebuilt libpng-1.2.44 and problem gone.
