Sorry for the delay on this one.

I cannot reproduce it locally, the ebuild depends on >=dev-libs/tinyxml-2.6.1-r1[stl], which is the minimum version that includes the mentioned fix.
Can you check which version of tinyxml you have installed? (or maybe a local copy of an older version hidden somewhere on the system)

Stabling a newer version of filezilla requires some stable keywords for dev-libs/pugixml first

Yeah, it started to build.
