Is there any way to help to test packages, to get them from test to stable state ?
Some of them seem to be blocked in a "test" or "unstable" state.

The docs-team has nothing to do with this. Could someone please re-assign the bug to the appropriate team?

there isnt much of a system that supports this ... you can file bugs requesting a package be moved to stable after it's been in unstable state for a few weeks ... just include your experience with the package and how it's been running nicely for you

also search bugzilla for the package you're interested in first to make sure all outstanding issues are resolved before trying to move it into stable
