Description

When running biber, there is a runtime dependency on dev-perl/Sub-Name.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. On a clean Gentoo install, "emerge biber"
2. Run biber against a sourced latex document
3. Note that Sub-Name did not get installed as a runtime dependency, resulting in failed attempts to run biber.
Actual Results:  
$ biber main
Can't locate Sub/Name.pm in @INC (you may need to install the Sub::Name module) (@INC contains: /etc/perl /usr/local/lib64/perl5/5.30.0/x86_64-linux /usr/local/lib64/perl5/5.30.0 /usr/lib64/perl5/vendor_perl/5.30.0/x86_64-linux /usr/lib64/perl5/vendor_perl/5.30.0 /usr/local/lib64/perl5 /usr/lib64/perl5/vendor_perl/5.26.2 /usr/lib64/perl5/vendor_perl /usr/lib64/perl5/5.30.0/x86_64-linux /usr/lib64/perl5/5.30.0) at /usr/lib64/perl5/vendor_perl/5.30.0/Package/DeprecationManager.pm line 13.

Simply emerging Sub-Name resolves the issue for me.

Biber does not use Sub::Name Module directly.
It's used by dev-perl/Package-DeprecationManager, which already requires dev-perl/Sub-Name.

Maybe you did a perl update and something went wrong.
Was the package dev-perl/Sub-Name already installed, before your merge?

Odd - I literally had a brand new install and "emerge biber" as the first thing I did. No issues on the merge, and running biber resulted in the above error. As it's working well now, I don't have much of an inclination to go reproduce the issue, but I can't figure out why it didn't get pulled in.
