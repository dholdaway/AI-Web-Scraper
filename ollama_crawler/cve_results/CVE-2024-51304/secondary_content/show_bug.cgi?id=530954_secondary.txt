Description

When trying to emerge dev-perl/Text-CharWidth, portage reports that digest verification failed for /usr/portage/dev-perl/Text-CharWidth/ChangeLog.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run "emerge dev-perl/Text-CharWidth"

Actual Results:  
Portage fails during digest verification:

Calculating dependencies... done!
>>> Verifying ebuild manifests

!!! Digest verification failed:
!!! /usr/portage/dev-perl/Text-CharWidth/ChangeLog
!!! Reason: Failed on SHA256 verification
!!! Got: 065cdf678f7f73d62ca80a988146ccaabbcbdc1a1c86cd43dea4605dabb66d42
!!! Expected: f2d09be1ec1d63d7b22d9ca926c00e617c353c9d2bdb63a7ffa2f70fbc193a70

Expected Results:  
dev-perl/Text-CharWidth is merged without errors.

Easy workaround: cd to /usr/portage/dev-perl/Text-CharWidth and run "repoman manifest".

Can't reproduce that. These files were last updated in August. Maybe you should check your rsync mirror.

It seems that the problem was not with any mirror, but my portage tree on disk:
After removing the /usr/portage/dev-perl/Text-CharWidth directory and running emerge-webrsync again, the problem disappeared.

Thanks for making me check twice and sorry about the bug-report.
