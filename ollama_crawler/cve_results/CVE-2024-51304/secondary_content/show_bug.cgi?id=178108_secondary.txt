Hi Volkmar,

Thanks for your bug report! I don't think octave uses libtool and the
cause for your problems probably lies somewhere else (please correct
me if I am wrong). It builds fine with libtool-1.5.23b on my dev boxes.

Could you please post your emerge --info and have a look at 
octMakefile to see if there's something obviously broken.

Thanks,
Markus

I think the problem is with the configure test for sed - it does not find sed, but does not fail either.

In this case I assume that in Makeconf you have the line 
SED = 
instead of
SED = /bin/sed

Which version of sed do you have installed and could you
possibly try reemerging it.

Thanks,
Markus

There is no mention of a SED variable anywhere in /etc/make.conf or /etc/make.conf.example (I built my make.conf from this example file). Is this documented somewhere else?

Re-emerging sed (same version, same use flags) seems to solve this issue, however.

Hi  Volkmar,

I am glad it works! Just to clarify, I was not referring to gentoo's
/etc/make.conf but rather to the file Makeconf in octave's build
directory; there indeed is not SED variable in /etc/make.conf ;)

I suspect there was a problem with your sed binary that caused
the test in octave's configure to fail. Unfortunately, configure
decided to keep going anyway instead of doing the right thing
and quitting.

cheers,
Markus
