After I ran revdep-rebuild, rebooting fails.
Here's the message:
* Checking local filesystems ...
e2fsck 1.41.9 (22-Aug-2009)
/dev/sda7: clean 910168/2436448 files,...
e2fsck 1.41.9 (22-Aug-2009)
/dev/sda5: clean, 53/65888 files...

(In red bullets)
* Filesystems couldn't be fixed
* rc: Aborting!
* fsck: caught SIGTERM, aborting
Failed to open /lib/splash/cache/.splash: No such file or directory
/bin/sed: couldn't open temporary file /etc/sedAHFGFD

This is (none).unknown_domain (Linux 2.6.32-gentoo-r3)

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I don't know
2.
3.




I can chroot with the live cd but I don't see anything wrong.

You should have tried the forum first.
Did you check those filesystems from livecd ?
What's in your fstab (perhaps one of the devices got renamed) ?

Sorry Rafal,

I guess I should have, I just got a bit frustrated.

Here's my fstab:
/dev/sda5		/boot		ext2		noauto,noatime	1 2
/dev/sda7		/		ext3		noatime		0 1
/dev/sda6		none		swap		sw		0 0
/dev/cdrom		/mnt/cdrom	auto		noauto,ro	0 0
/dev/sda2		/media/win7		ntfs		noauto,users,umask=000,fmask=000,noatime	1 2

I did find a workaround, yet not a fix:
I edited start() in /etc/runlevels/boot/fsck
And terminated the fsck before it had a chance to run.
start()
{
    local fsck_opts= p= check_extra=

  # Disable for now
  return 0
    if [ -e /fastboot ]; then
        ewarn "Skipping fsck due to /fastboot"
        return 0
    fi
 

It's an ugly workaround but at least the RC doesn't bail out on me. The file system is clean and that's weird. Do you think it's the ntfs partition that is causing this?

try:
emerge -e system
etc-update

I tried emerge -e system and etc-update, but all that did, AFAIK, was allow the fsck to work. So, for now, I will leave things the way they are, and disable fsck.
