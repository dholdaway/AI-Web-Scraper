After upgraded kopete to net-im/kopete-0.12.1.r2 from r1, it can't connect to the ICQ server. 
("The ICQ server thinks, the client you're using is too old"). I've tried to downgrade back to r1, but with the same problem. 
In KDE-Bug-Tracking-System, I've got the hint 0.12.0 works, but this is out of portage yet.

Use 0.12.1-r3.
