glances-3.1.5.ebuild.patch

Run glances v 3.1.5:

glances -w
Bottle module not found. Glances cannot start in web server mode.


Install bottle package and run again:

emerge -1 dev-python/bottle
glances -w
Glances Web User Interface started on http://0.0.0.0:61208/

Normally optional runtime-only dependencies aren't given USE flags and so we have optfeature warnings instead (shown if not installed after emerging glances):

    optfeature "Web server mode" dev-python/bottle dev-python/requests

I assume you may have missed the message.
