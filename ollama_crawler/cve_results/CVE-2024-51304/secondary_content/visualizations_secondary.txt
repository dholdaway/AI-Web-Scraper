NVD Visualizations
This section of the NVD is designed to give users of the NVD data different 
			ways to look at the data and provide an overview to the data and hopefully spark some interest 
			into why a particular visualization looks the way it does.
		
One visualization not here that many people often ask for is a visualization showing vulnerability 
			by product. While the NVD data does associate products to vulnerabilities to assist in 
			patching, it is not an appropriate use of the data to demonstrate the relative security of 
			products based on the number of vulnerabilities contained within the NVD data. The NVD only 
			contains a subset of all publicly disclosed vulnerabilities that have been given a CVE 
			identifier, leaving out the rest of the universe of vulnerabilities that exist, which include 
			but are not limited to undiscovered vulnerabilties, unreported vulnerabilties, undisclosed vulnerabilities, etc...
		
Many of the visualizations use the 
			D3.js libary (Data-Driven Documents). 
			We would like to thank Judith Terrill and the 
			
				High Performance Computing and Visualization Group
			 for starting many of these visualizations and developing some of the first prototypes.

		Vuln Summary Word Frequency Cloud
This visualization was generated by calculating the frequency of words (common words such as 
			"the" and "a" were excluded) that were part of the vulnerability summary description.
