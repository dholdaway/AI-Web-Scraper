GILEAD SCIENCES ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTSProduct Sales Excluding Veklury Increased Year-Over-Year by 7% for Full Year 2023Biktarvy Sales Increased Year-Over-Year by 14% for Full Year 2023Oncology Sales Increased Year-Over-Year by 37% for Full Year 2023Foster City, CA, February 6, 2024 - Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) announced today its results of operations for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. “This was another strong year of revenue growth for Gilead’s base business, driven by both HIV and Oncology,” said Daniel O’Day, Gilead’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “The strength of the business provides a solid foundation as we enter a new catalyst-rich phase for the company. We are expecting several milestones in 2024, including updates on long-acting HIV prevention and treatment, Cell Therapy and Trodelvy.”Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results•Total fourth quarter 2023 revenue decreased 4% to $7.1 billion compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to lower Veklury® (remdesivir) and HIV sales, partially offset by higher Oncology sales.•Diluted Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) decreased to $1.14 in the fourth quarter 2023 compared to $1.30 in the same period in 2022, primarily due to higher total costs and expenses, and lower Veklury revenues, partially offset by unrealized gains on equity investments in 2023 compared to losses in 2022, and lower tax expense. •Non-GAAP diluted EPS increased to $1.72 in the fourth quarter 2023 compared to $1.67 in the same period in 2022, primarily due to lower total costs and expenses, partially offset by lower Veklury revenues.•As of December 31, 2023, Gilead had $8.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities compared to $7.6 billion as of December 31, 2022.•During the fourth quarter 2023, Gilead generated $2.2 billion in operating cash flow. •During the fourth quarter 2023, Gilead paid cash dividends of $943 million and utilized $150 million to repurchase common stock.Fourth Quarter 2023 Product SalesTotal fourth quarter 2023 product sales decreased 4% to $7.1 billion compared to the same period in 2022. Total product sales, excluding Veklury, of $6.3 billion were flat compared to the same period in 2022, with higher Oncology sales partially offset by lower HIV sales.HIV product sales decreased 2% to $4.7 billion in the fourth quarter 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, primarily driven by lower average realized price due to channel mix, partially offset by higher demand and channel inventory dynamics.•Biktarvy® (bictegravir 50mg/emtricitabine (“FTC”) 200mg/tenofovir alafenamide (“TAF”) 25mg) sales increased 7% to $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, primarily reflecting higher demand, partially offset by lower average realized price due to channel mix.•Descovy® (FTC 200mg/TAF 25mg) sales decreased 5% to $509 million in the fourth quarter 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, primarily driven by unfavorable pricing dynamics in the United States, partially offset by higher demand and channel inventory dynamics.The following information was filed by Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD) on Tuesday, February 6, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.

 Inside Gilead Sciences Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Changes in these conditions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.



 Other - Other   Highlight
If future events result in adverse changes in the critical assumptions used in determining fair value, impairment charges on our intangible assets may be recorded and could be material to our financial statements.

 Other - Other   Highlight
These estimates are subject to uncertainty due to the high rate of failure inherent in the discovery and development of new products; delays that can occur in development, approval and product launch processes; unanticipated decisions made by regulatory agencies; advent of competing products; unexpected changes in U.S. and global financial markets and other unanticipated events and circumstances.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
The increase was primarily due to lower in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) impairment expenses, lower net unrealized losses on equity investments and higher interest income, partially offset by higher costs of goods sold and operating expenses, and lower revenues.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Also, Descovy sales increased primarily driven by favorable channel inventory dynamics and higher demand.
