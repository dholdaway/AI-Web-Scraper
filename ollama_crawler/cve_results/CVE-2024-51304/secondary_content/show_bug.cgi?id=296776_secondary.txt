I need openafs, but I cannot use any of the versions: (-1.4.9, -1.4.10 and -1.4.11) All have different errors.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.compile gentoo kernel linux-2.6.31-gentoo-r6
2.change package.keyword with the version you want (ex:=net-fs/openafs-1.4.11 ~amd64)
3.emerge openafs
4./etc/init.d/openafs-client start

Actual Results:  
openafs-1.4.9 : cannot emerge: 

Error message:
* ERROR: net-fs/openafs-kernel-1.4.9 failed.
 * Call stack:
 *               ebuild.sh, line   49:  Called src_compile
 *             environment, line 3519:  Called die
 * The specific snippet of co


============

openafs-1.4.10: Can emerge but can not start.

"/etc/init.d/openafs-client restart" gives:

* Starting OpenAFS client ...
 *   Loading OpenAFS kernel module ...
 FATAL: Error inserting libafs (/lib/modules/2.6.31-gentoo-r6/fs/openafs/libafs.ko): Unknown symbol in module, or unknown parameter (see dmesg)
  *   Failed loading the afs kernel module    [ !! ]
=================

openafs-1.4.11: Can emerge but can not start.

"/etc/init.d/openafs-client start" gives:

 * Starting OpenAFS client ...
 *   OpenAFS already active, trying to unload module
 *   Loading OpenAFS kernel module            [ ok ]
 *   Starting OpenAFS daemon                  [ !! ]

then "rc-status" gives the following output:

openafslient            [ stopped  ]



Expected Results:  
Being able to access afs folders

After I did the whole installation of gentoo from the beginning with kernel linux-2.6.30-gentoo-r5, I was able to use openafs 1.4.10.
