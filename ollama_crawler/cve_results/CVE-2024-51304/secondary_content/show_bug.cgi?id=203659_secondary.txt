I know ncurses ada support/binding is in the works etc, but it checks for ada USE flag anyway, for example

$(use_enable !ada warnings) \

So ada should be added to IUSE (or this check removed).

putting it into IUSE would imply it's ready for use when it isnt

And using it without putting it in IUSE is a QA violation.
At least without it in IUSE it will always work as if it were disabled and ineffective, as presented to the user..

still unresolved. Are the solutions suggested in the report and in comment #2 not applicable? Why isn't this fixed yet?
