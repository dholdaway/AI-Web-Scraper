          2010-05-14 09:19:36 UTC
        

After opening a particular window which contains a xml file and a jpg file nauilus chrashes. This happens when I try to open the wallpaper directory which I downloaded from this place: https://launchpad.net/~bisigi/+archive/ppa/+files/wild-shine-theme_1.4.1.lucid.ppa1+nmu1.tar.gz

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download the theme
2. Unpack it in the root home directory
3. Goto the wallpaper dir
4, Nautilus chrashes
Actual Results:  
Nautlilus chrashes

Expected Results:  
Nautilus let me see the directory

Please test on a new created user account and, if still valid, try to get a proper backtrace (http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/qa/backtraces.xml) and provide "emerge --info" output

Thanks

Hello Pacho, 

One question.
When I do the changes to cflags. Do I need to re-meerge nautilus or can I proceed with the installed nautlilus.

You need to re-emerge it (and probably also those packages in RDEPEND)

Hello, 

Here's the backtrace I get when re-emerging nautilus again :

gdb nautilus
GNU gdb (Gentoo 7.1 p1) 7.1

    import gdb.backtrace

Program exited normally.
(gdb) bt
No stack.

So nothing to see but it's still happens.

What's now the best step ?

Seems that it's not crashing :-O, I would install gnome-extra/bug-buddy also and, then, try to reproduce the bug. If nautilus crashes, it will be cached by bug-buddy that will guide you.

Hello, 

Bug-buddy gives this :

he application File Browser crashed. The bug reporting tool was unable to collect enough information about the crash to be useful to the developers.

In order to submit useful reports, please consider installing debug packages for your distribution.

OKe, 

I change in make.conf this :
CFLAGS="-O2 -pipe -ggdb"
CXXFLAGS="-O2 -pipe -ggdb"
FEATURES="splitdebug"

But still the same backtrace :

You need to *append* splitdebug in features, not drop all the other.

Did you tried to reproduce the crash when running nautilus from gdb?

Hello, 

Sorry, but how do I append the splitdebug.
I thought this was the right way.

Yes, the trace is made when running nautilus from gdb.

We will try to do it in a different way then:
1. Revert to original /etc/make.conf
2. Run the following:
FEATURES="$FEATURES debug splitdebug" CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -ggdb" emerge -1 glib gnome-desktop pango gtk+ libxml2 gconf nautilus

Then, let bug-buddy act

Good luck!

Are you able to reproduce this crash on a new created user account?

Hello , 

On a newly created account this problem did not show up.
I have on a newly created account the problem that I can't open a terminal.
I then get this message : there is a error creating the child process for this terminal.

Then, nautilus crash seems to be caused by some old and buggy configuration, this bug would be invalid then as we wouldn't be able to know how to reproduce the crash. Maybe you could try moving away some config files (like .nautilus) and seeing the results. If you are able to know the exact steps to reproduce the problem on a new created user acccount, feel free to reopen with them. Thanks

About the other problem, you should probably try to launch "xterm" and see what prevents "gnome-terminal" from running. Please, go to forums to ask for help (bugzilla is not the proper place for making all this general investigations):

Good luck!

Hello Pacho,

I deleted all the config files of the regular user due to other problems.
And now nautilus chrashes also when these user chooses the background which is part of the theme.

I get no report from bug buddy

This could be due to problem in GTK+'s libpng loader when using libpng-1.4

Please re-emerge gtk+-2.20.1 and see whether it still crashes.

Yes, please try it with Gnome 2.30 that is entering official tree (in a few hours). I am unable to reproduce the crash with it
