DOSBox is unable to produce MIDI sound if timidity has been started with:

/etc/init.d/timidity start

If, however, I start timidity manually with the same command line args the init script uses:

/usr/bin/timidity -iA -B2,8 -Os -EFreverb=1

Then it works without problems.

Note that other programs don't seem to have a problem with this (like "aplaymidi --port 128 SomeMidiFile.mid").  Only DOSBox is acting up.

I also tried the dosbox-9999 ebuild.  Same problem.

Is this still an issue?  I've never been able to reproduce it.

Hm, I don't know really. I've switched my setup to FluiSynth instead. I suppose this can be closed.
