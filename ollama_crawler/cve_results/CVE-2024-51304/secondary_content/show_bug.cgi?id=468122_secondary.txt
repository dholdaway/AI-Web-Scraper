This flag is deprecated.  Why would you need to set it?

One of Peotoo users reported that it is necessary for the cryptohaze-combined tool:
https://code.google.com/p/pentoo/issues/detail?id=133

It does exist in the "PaX control v0.7" and he tested it.

If it is deprecated, what would be an alternative way?..

paxctl can set/unset RANDEXEC, but is not recognized in the kernel.  grep the hardened-sources tree to convince yourself.  Setting it cannot be the cause of pentoo issue #133.

ok, fair enough. I'll drop it from the list then. 
Thanks for the clarification.
