(NYSE: BIG) today reported a net loss of $30.7 million, or $1.05 per share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 ended February 3, 2024. This result includes a net after-tax loss of $22.4 million, or $0.77 per share, associated with distribution center closure costs, impairment charges, and fees related to Project Springboard, offset in part by gains on the sale of real estate and an income tax benefit related to the valuation allowance recorded earlier in 2023. Excluding this loss, the adjusted net loss in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $8.3 million, or $0.28 per share (see non-GAAP table included later in this release). The adjusted net loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 was $8.1 million, or $0.28 per share.Net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 totaled $1.432 billion, a 7.2% decrease compared to $1.543 billion for the same period last year. The decline to last year was driven by a comparable sales decrease of 8.6%. The net impact of the benefit of the 53rd week was offset in part by a net decrease in store count, which contributed approximately 140 basis points of sales growth compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.Commenting on today’s results announcement, Bruce Thorn, President and CEO of Big Lots stated, “I’m pleased to report another quarter of sequential improvement in comps and gross margin rate, while continuing to take out costs. For the third quarter in a row, we did what we said we would do, and despite a challenging macroeconomic environment and well documented weather challenges in January, we finished the year in a much better place than where we started. That said, there’s a lot of work to do in 2024, and we are moving aggressively to accelerate our The following information was filed by Big Lots Inc (BIG) on Tuesday, March 12, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.
