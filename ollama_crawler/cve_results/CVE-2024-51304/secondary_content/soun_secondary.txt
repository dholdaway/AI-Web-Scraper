Forward Looking Statements and Other
Disclosures
 
This press release contains forward-looking
statements, which are not historical facts, within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such

and services, our ability to achieve revenue from our cumulative bookings backlog and subscription bookings backlog, and guidance for
financial results for 2024 and 2025. Such forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that, while
considered reasonable by us and our management, are inherently uncertain. As a result, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance
on these forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking
statements as a result of risks and uncertainties impacting SoundHound’s business including, our ability to successfully launch
and commercialize new products and services and derive significant revenue, our ability to develop the bespoke products and services required
under the contracts included in our bookings backlog, including, but not limited to, our ability to convert customer adoption of Smart

Certain Defined Terms
 
Cumulative Subscriptions & Bookings Backlog:
The company has updated this metric to incorporate its customer subscriptions activity with previously disclosed cumulative bookings backlog.
Cumulative bookings backlog takes into account the prior quarter end balance of bookings backlog plus new bookings in the current quarter
minus associated revenue recognized from bookings from prior periods. Cumulative bookings backlog is derived from committed customer contracts
and this definition remains the same as the previous one. Subscriptions backlog refers to potential revenue achievable for the company
with current customers where the company is the leading or exclusive provider, and assuming a 4-year ramp up during which time our technologies
are being implemented and assuming a successful full roll out of our technologies over a total 5-year duration. Reasonable assumptions
about adoption percentages are included, with lower percentages applied to pilot and proof-of-concept customers.
 
Non-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance
 
To supplement the company’s financial
statements, which are presented on the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the following non-GAAP measure of
financial performance is included in this release: adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as the company’s GAAP net loss excluding
(i) interest and other expense, net, (ii) depreciation and amortization expense, (iii) income taxes, (iv) stock-based compensation, (v)
acquisition-related expenses, and (vi) restructuring expense. A reconciliation of GAAP to this adjusted non-GAAP financial measure is
included below. When analyzing the company's operating results, investors should not consider non-GAAP measures as substitutes for the
comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 
The Company does not present a quantitative
reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures and Adjusted EBITDA, to the most directly comparable GAAP financial
measure (or otherwise present such forward-looking GAAP measures) because it is impractical to forecast certain items without unreasonable
efforts due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty of predicting, within a reasonable range, the occurrence and financial impact of
and the periods in which such items may be recognized.
