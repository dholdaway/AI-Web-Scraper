 Inside Weis Markets Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Management remains confident in its ability to generate long-term sales growth in a highly competitive environment, but also understands some competitors have greater financial resources and could use these resources to take measures which could adversely affect the Company’s competitive position.



 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Volume incentive discounts are accounted for as a reduction of cost of sales and realized using estimated amounts at the time it is deemed probable that the incentive target will be reached.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Although the Company experienced retail inflation and deflation in various commodities for the periods presented, the Company anticipates overall product costs to increase given the recent inflationary indicators in the food retail industry.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
Income taxes are inherently complex and require Management’s evaluation and estimates, specifically regarding current and deferred income taxes and uncertain tax positions.

 Other - Other   Highlight
For example, risks and uncertainties can arise with changes in: general economic conditions, including their impact on capital expenditures; business conditions in the retail industry; the regulatory environment; rapidly changing technology and competitive factors, including increased competition with regional and national retailers; and price pressures.
