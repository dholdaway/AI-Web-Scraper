Hi,

Look at the output of
cd /somedir; start-stop-daemon --start --exec /usr/bin/pwd

It's "/somedir" and that's problematic. Some programs don't like it, if the
current workdir is not accessible, and this might be the case if you start the
daemon in /root, /root has the mode 0700, and the daemon switches to another user.

Long story short, start-stop-daemon --help states the following:
  -C|--chdir <directory>        Change to <directory>(default is /)

but the default doesn't seem to exist.

I'm using sys-apps/baselayout-1.11.13-r1

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:

this has been fixed in baselayout-1.12.x already

Do any init scripts do this? If so, file a bug for each package it belongs to. Closing this one as WORKSFORME as we have fixed this in baselayout-1.12
