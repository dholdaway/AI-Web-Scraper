 Inside Proto Labs Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
In many cases, we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates.



 Other - Other   Highlight
There are no pending accounting pronouncements that are expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Financial - Debt   Highlight
If we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt securities or enter into credit facilities, these securities and debt holders could have rights senior to those of our common stock, and this debt could contain covenants that would restrict our operations.

 Other - Other   Highlight
We did not recently adopt any accounting pronouncements that had a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Legal - Other   Highlight
However, because tax laws and financial accounting standards differ in their recognition and measurement of assets, liabilities and equity, revenues, expenses, gains and losses, differences arise between the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
