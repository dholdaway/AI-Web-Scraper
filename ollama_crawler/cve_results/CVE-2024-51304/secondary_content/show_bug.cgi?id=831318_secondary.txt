Description

I'm not sure if I missed something, but after installing dev-java/openjfx-11.0.11_p1 I had to manually add the .jar files to CLASSPATH in order to use openjfx with openjdk-bin-11 as Java VM.

Also I noticed that openjfx does not show up in

java-config --list-available-packages

To repeat, everything works fine but I have to manually add openjfx to the CLASSPATH, so please put that in the ebuild instead. I don't know how to do that.

openjfx is supposed to be used with openjdk:11, not openjdk-bin:11

while some stuff may work with classpath, not everything does.
jfx changed the way it's installed after jdk-9

basically it has to link jfx in at build time.
since we don't build -bin package - we can't link it in.

OK, I didn't know that. Can I use openjdk:11 as system vm?

on unstable ~ yes already, it was unmasked recently.

but soon on stable too.

new release tag should be out tomorrow and it will be usable as default VM after it's stabilized.
so in about a week, maximum 2.

but to use openjfx on stable you'll have to enable and unmask openjfx flag.
it's stable-masked

https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/profile/package.use.mask


you'll need to

mkdir -p /etc/portage/profile
echo 'dev-java/openjdk:11 -javafx' >> /etc/portage/profile/package.use.mask


and it will become usable.

Explanation given in comment #3. No need to keep it this open. Closing.
