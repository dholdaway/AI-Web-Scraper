Description

PDC20375 (FastTrak S150 TX2Plus) and PDC20575 (SATAII150 TX2Plus) supports both SATA and PATA. 2.6.18-rc2 and former kernels don't seem to find the PATA port. I've made a patch that solves the issue. The patch is based on a patch davej submitted to the Red Hat Fedora CVS in March 2006.

This patch is for the 2.6.18-rc2 kernel.

We have already shipped this patch in gentoo-sources for more than a year

My bad. Apparently the vanilla kernel (www.kernel.org) still doesn't have it. At least I can't access my PATA-port without this patch when running 2.6.18-rc1 or 2.6.18-rc2.

Yep. We don't patch vanilla-sources, so if you want to hurry up the inclusion process there, mail Jeff Garzik reminding him about the code and point out that it works just fine for you. He has this in a dedicated branch of libata-dev.git

Otherwise, just use gentoo-sources :)
