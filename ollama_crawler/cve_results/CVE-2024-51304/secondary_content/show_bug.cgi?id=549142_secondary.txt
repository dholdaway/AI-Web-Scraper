Doesn't appear to affect the rest of the build.

I know, it's completely harmless. Fixing it is not worth the effort.
The generated path is correct anyway:

$ cat mkspecs/modules/qt_tool_uic.pri
QT_TOOL.uic.binary = /tmp/portage/dev-qt/qtwidgets-5.4.1/work/qtbase-opensource-src-5.4.1/bin/uic
QT_TOOL.uic.depends = core

and:

 * Running emake in src/widgets
make -j8
QT_PLUGIN_PATH=/tmp/portage/dev-qt/qtwidgets-5.4.1/work/qtbase-opensource-src-5.4.1/plugins LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH} /tmp/portage/dev-qt/qtwidgets-5.4.1/work/qtbase-opensource-src-5.4.1/bin/uic dialogs/qfiledialog.ui -o .uic/ui_qfiledialog.h
