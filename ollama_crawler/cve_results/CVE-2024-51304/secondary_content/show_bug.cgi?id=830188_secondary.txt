Now that PipeWire provides a replacement for the PulseAudio daemon, the pavucontrol GUI can be used to control PipeWire. The current ebuild in Gentoo wants to install PulseAudio, which is unnecessary in this configuration.

Reproducible: Always

Are you sure it doesn't need libpulse still? I'm fairly sure it does.

pavucontrol requires client libs to work
It may be worth making a forward-looking change to add media-libs/libpulse alternative.

It's worth noting that media-sound/pavucontrol does not require the daemon USE flag on media-sound/pulseaudio. Another thing to note is that plasma-pa can do nearly(?) everything that pavucontrol does. And similarly GNOME's control center has built-in PulseAudio support.

You are right. I can disable every USE flag on the pulseaudio package, except glib, and that satisfies pavucontrol. I am OK with that.

I will leave it up to the gentoo people to decide whether to close this bug or keep it open (for some pulseaudio alternatives or something?).

I think this is solved anyway, but even more so w/ the improved pulseaudio meta package and split into libpulse & pulseaudio-daemon.
