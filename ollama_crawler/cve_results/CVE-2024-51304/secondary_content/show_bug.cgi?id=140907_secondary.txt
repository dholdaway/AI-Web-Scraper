The evdev 1.1x release is a full rewrite with full hotplugging support. The configuration has significantly changed and this manpage details how to configure the new evdev. Please install this manpage by default.

the man page "evdev"

feld@mark-laptop ~ $ man evdev


I had to install it manually because the ebuild didn't include it. It's included in the tarball for this version....
