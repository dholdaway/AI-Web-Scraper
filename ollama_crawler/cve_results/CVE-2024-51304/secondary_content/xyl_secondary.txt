(NYSE: XYL), a leading global water technology company dedicated to solving the world’s most challenging water issues, today reported fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 results. The Company’s total revenue of $2.1 billion surpassed prior guidance, on continued strong execution and demand. Fourth-quarter earnings exceeded Xylem’s previous guidance.“The team delivered an outstanding fourth quarter, fueling momentum as we enter 2024,” said Matthew Pine, Xylem president and CEO. “Revenue, margin and earnings per share all exceeded expectations, driven by strong execution on healthy demand across our business. In a transformational year for Xylem, the team stayed focused on serving our customers and delivered strong results on both the top and bottom lines.”“That discipline and focus, paired with continuing resilient underlying demand, gives us confidence in further growth and margin expansion in the year ahead. Our integration of Evoqua is ahead of schedule, and our team is taking full advantage of the breadth of our combined offering to solve even more of our customers’ water challenges.”Net income was $266 million, or $1.10 per share. Net income margin increased 270 basis points to 12.6 percent. These results are driven by strong operational performance and non-recurring tax benefits, partially offset by higher acquisition and integration costs related to the Evoqua transaction, purchase accounting intangible amortization, special charges, and restructuring and realignment costs. Adjusted net income was $239 million, or $0.99 per share, which excludes the impacts of special charges, purchase accounting intangible amortization, and restructuring and realignment costs.Fourth-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin was 19.6 percent, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 90 basis points.

 Inside Xylem Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates under different assumptions or conditions.



 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
However, future indefinite-lived intangible impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Significant changes to these estimates and assumptions could adversely impact our conclusions.

 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
Order intake during the year was negatively impacted by $18 million of foreign currency translation, with organic orders being essentially flat.

 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
Significant assumptions and estimates include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the cost to build/recreate certain technology, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset.
