Please verify your dodoc statements, and make sure they are not being executed on directories. See the blocked bug for more details.

I cannot reproduce this. The dodoc statement is:

    dodoc [A-Z][A-Z]* ChangeLog

Arguably, this isn't the best style. But still, how can it possibly match lowercase "doc", "etc", and "src"?

No reply for almost a year. Closing.
