eselect for make.conf  make_conf folder in /etc/portage

vanilla_make.conf

Sabayon-vanilla-make.conf

testing_make.conf 

production-backup-make.conf


eselect list make-conf list make.confs the  dir...

elsect set make-conf and # 


set symlink make.conf to number chosen


set /etc/make.conf symlink to number chosen . ye olden compatibility. 

can hot fix emerges a bit simply , my default system is Sabayon with a dash of Pentoo. so buggering with the package.use or mask can on a system already dancing of the knifes edge of bleeding edge, can lead to a cliff. 
being able to fast set make.conf's to need might be of use. 

since i just build packages along with my emerge just in case something snafu's....


anyhow form a tinker testing standpoint i though it would be a useful addition to eselect.

We already have `eselect profile' for this.

Set up a local overlay with the required (make.conf) files in profiles/ and use eselect to select one.
