Description

With dev-util/gtk-doc-1.10-r1, the file /usr/share/aclocal/gtk-doc.m4 has been split off into its own package, dev-util/gtk-doc-am-1.10-r1.  However, it seems that gtk-doc still thinks it owns it (or so says qlist).  This means you can end up with a system which thinks it has that .m4 file installed but does not.

This arose in processing Bug 223297.

$ qfile /usr/share/aclocal/gtk-doc.m4 
dev-util/gtk-doc-am (/usr/share/aclocal/gtk-doc.m4)

Try removing both gtk-doc and gtk-doc-am and rebuilding them... you may have some inconsistencies left over from older times :)

and don't always trust qlist, it works with prefixes so if you use qlist gtk-doc-1.10 you should not see the macro :)

Yes, eventually everything got installed correctly.  I thought I had already done that, but I guess not.  It's my problem, so I'll quietly slink away.
