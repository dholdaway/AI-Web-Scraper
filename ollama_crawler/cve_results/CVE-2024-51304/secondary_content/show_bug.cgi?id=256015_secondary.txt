since you're the very first one reporting this and it has always been working fine here I seriously doubt its due to using econf for a non autotools configure... the problem probably lies somewhere else

Is the script autoconf-based? It doesn't seem to be looking at it.
And econf shouldn't be used for non-autoconf-based scripts, no matter how similar they look...

I can feed it with any option I want I can't manage to make it die; here econf is just a shortcut for the --prefix/mandir options (maybe others too)
