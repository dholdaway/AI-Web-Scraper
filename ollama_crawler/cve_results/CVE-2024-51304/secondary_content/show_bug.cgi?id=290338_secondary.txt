This is the release many have waited for, with support for binary externals, so looking forward to see it getting into the tree.

Reproducible: Always

I'm one of Subversion upstream developers and I know about all new releases, so you don't need to report such bugs.

Yes I know, it was merely meant as a (gentle) request to get an ebuild in the tree ;-)

When ever you have time, of course.
