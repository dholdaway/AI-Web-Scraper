Description

          2009-03-13 02:31:48 UTC
        

Hello,

I tried v1.2.6 and v1.2.7 and both fail the same way, when I call:

    emerge sdl-image

=====================================
...                                  
checking for SDL - version >= 1.2.10... no
*** Could not run SDL test program, checking why...
*** The test program compiled, but did not run. This usually means
*** that the run-time linker is not finding SDL or finding the wrong
*** version of SDL. If it is not finding SDL, you'll need to set your
*** LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable, or edit /etc/ld.so.conf to point
*** to the installed location  Also, make sure you have run ldconfig if that
*** is required on your system                                              
***                                                                         
*** If you have an old version installed, it is best to remove it, although 
*** you may also be able to get things to work by modifying LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
configure: error: *** SDL version 1.2.10 not found!
...
=====================================

I will attach the necessary logs after submission.

The thing is: I have media-libs/libsdl-1.2.13-r1 installed!
I tried to recompile libsdl and sdl-image.
...
I don't know how to get rid of this error message.

Actually the problem is related to another bug I reported, because in the config.log it says:
    ./conftest: error while loading shared libraries: libxcb-xlib.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

See Bug 262338 (but the bug 262338 is for the fact that seemingly the preserved-rebuild and/or the xcb-rebuilder.sh mechanism did not work well for me).

Any hint/help/feedback will be highly appreciated.

tormen.



Reproducible: Always

It's not simply related, it's a clear duplicate.

What you're facing is most probably la files corruption
(unless you still didn't run revdep-rebuild).

Actually, now that I looked at your config.log,
I see you didn't run it yet.

hmmm
It is true that I did not run revdep-rebuild yet.
But only because I was told that revdep-rebuild 
is supposed to be replaced by the @preserved-rebuild set.
Or what did I get wrong ?!

... but I will run it now.

Thnx anyway for your input!

That's probably more or less true for library major version
upgrades, but here the lib is simply gone, as it turned redundant
(I don't know for sure - I've got '-preserve-libs' in FEATURES).
