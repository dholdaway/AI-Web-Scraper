I have a stage4 with xen 3.3.1-r1 working very well on a server.

If I update xen to > 3.3.1-r1, then my windows guest fail to install. While windows is coping file before the first reboot, my vm crash.
this append while copying :
- shell32.dll with XP
- adminpack.msi with 2003

I don't know if its a xen or ebuild bug so i'm starting here.

I was first thinking that its an ACPI problem but with acpi=0 its the same.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.install xen
2.install windows on a guest

Actual Results:  
vm crash

Expected Results:  
no crash
