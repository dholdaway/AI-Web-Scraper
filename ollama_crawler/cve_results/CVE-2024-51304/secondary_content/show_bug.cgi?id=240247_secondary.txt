Hi,
I've problem to build virtinst. I've found that the problem is in a python import of libvirtmod.

>> Compiling source in /mnt/virtualfs/APPOGGIO/var_tmp/portage/app-emulation/virtinst-0.300.3-r1/work/virtinst-0.300.3 ...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "setup.py", line 10, in <module>

the setup.py try to import libvirtmod failing.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.emerge -av virtinst
2.cd /usr/lib64/python2.5/site-packages
3.python 
4.import libvirtmod

Very strange!
I've rebuilded from source after installing cyrus-sasl package from portage.
i've tried to import libvirtmod and I did that without problem.

Then I remove cyrus-sasl package and I rebuilded libvirtd from portage...Now the import of libvirtmod is ok...
In my mind I think that something was broken...But In can't understand what could be that a remove cannot clean.

The problem is here...
I've verified that with source configuration/installation I can import the libvirtmod without problem.
