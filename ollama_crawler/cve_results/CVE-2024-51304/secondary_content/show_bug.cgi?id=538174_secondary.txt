Hmm, I've got a good copy in /var/portage/distfiles
What should be done now? (sorry I'm not familier with this process).

Jeroen, thank you for your valuable and detailed reply, supported by helpful references.  If we only had more developers like you, Gentoo would be an awesome distribution with no bugs open!

It looks like it was generating the man page in src_compile() and then again in src_install().
