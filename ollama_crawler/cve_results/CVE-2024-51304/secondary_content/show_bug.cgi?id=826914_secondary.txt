Hm, the only way I see this would happen is if it finds CL/cl.hpp (in /usr/include or /usr/local/include)

This /used/ to be installed by dev-libs/clhpp but that hasn't been the case since version 2.0.11 (not in tree anymore, current stable 2.0.15 doesn't install it)

Any idea?

Many thanks, there existed /usr/include/CL/cl.hpp indeed.
After removing it, emerge succeeded.
