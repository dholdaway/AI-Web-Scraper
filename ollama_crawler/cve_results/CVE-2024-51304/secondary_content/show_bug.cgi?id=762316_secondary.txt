After installing Missile-1.0.1-r1 under KDE Plasma, I tried to start the game. But it immediately died with the folollowing error:

Couldn't set 11025 Hz 8-bit audio
- Reason: No available audio device

ERROR: reading game data 'missile_launch.wav'
Trying to open the file reports: Resource temporarily unavailable
The error is: Audio device hasn't been opened

If you need to set the data directory, run "missile --set-datadir=<datadir>".

Run "missile -h" for command line options

I do have an audio card, the intel/RealTek sound chip on the motherboard that works fine for other uses. Not sure if missile isn't finding the card, or is trying to open it exclusively. But it's not working.

What is your sound system?
emerge -1a sys-apps/inxi
$ inxi -A

My sound system is Alsa+Pulse

$ inxi -A
Audio:     Device-1: Intel 7 Series/C216 Family High Definition Audio driver: snd_hda_intel 
           Sound Server: ALSA v: k5.4.83

You may need to set SDL_AUDIODRIVER manually depending on what you built libsdl with and how your system is setup, i.e. USE=pulseaudio on libsdl and SDL_AUDIODRIVER=pulse is most common, try =dummy (no sound) if all else fails.

This game seems fine for me as long as the above is valid.
