The option "Move pointer with keyboard (using the num pad)" from Accessibility section doesn't work with plasma-desktop-5.27.7.1.
Works fine after downgrading that and plasma-meta packages to 5.27.6:
kde-plasma/plasma-desktop-5.27.6
kde-plasma/plasma-meta-5.27.6

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
System Settings -> Accessibility -> Mouse Navigation -> Move pointer with keyboard (using the num pad).
Works fine with 5.27.6, doesn't work with 5.27.7

What about 5.27.8?

Doesn't work.
I've added all kde-plasma/* packages to accept_keywords, mouse pointing option doesn't work after upgrade.
Works again after downgrade plasma-desktop and plasma-meta to 5.27.6.

Well, I can confirm the function does nothing in 5.27.8.

Please open a bug on bugs.kde.org and link to it here using the $URL field so we can track upstream progress.

Did you try to log out after enabling the feature, and log back in again?

At least that's how it works for me.
