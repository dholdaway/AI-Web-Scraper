Configure seems to run OK, but compile fails with
 make[2]: Entering directory '/var/tmp/portage/app-emulation/dosemu-1.4.1_pre20130107-r5/work/dosemu-code-15cfb41ff20a052769d753c3262c57ecb050ad71/src/env/video'
x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-gcc -c -MP -MMD -I../../../src/include -I../../../src/plugin/include  -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wmissing-declarations -Wnested-externs  -fno-strict-aliasing 
-pipe -march=native -O2 -pipe -o miscemu.o miscemu.c
In file included from miscemu.c:67:
../../../src/include/config.h:38:10: fatal error: confpath.h: No such file or directory
   38 | #include "confpath.h"

It looks like confpath.h should be created by src/arch/linux/Makefile.main but I don't follow the logic well enough to know exactly when that should get called.

Considering how long it's been since 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.emerge dosemu
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
failure to find confpath.h

Expected Results:  
successful compile

I don't actually use dosemu any more, but I just tested and version 1.4.1_pre20130107-r5 (still same version) installs without problem.  
I'll guess some other library got updated and installs the missing file

Closing as WORKSFORME, but feel free to change to anything more appropriate.
