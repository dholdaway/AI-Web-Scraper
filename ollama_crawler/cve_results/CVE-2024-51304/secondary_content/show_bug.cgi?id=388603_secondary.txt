net-im/pidgin blocks bug 292402 since it depends on <sys-devel/python-3

Reproducible: Always

Sorry, I thought bug 29402 was for python-2 dependent ebuilds.

Is there a point to this bug? The ebuild already has the correct dependency listed.

Please set the status to RESOLVED unless you have some other reason to keep it open.
