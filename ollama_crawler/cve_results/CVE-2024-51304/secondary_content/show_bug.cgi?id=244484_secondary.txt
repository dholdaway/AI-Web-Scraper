Since rspec 1.1.11 there are no dependency needed by Rspec.

But in rpsec-1.1.11.ebuild there are a depends of hoe-1.8.1

Reproducible: Always

According to the metadata in the gem rspec 1.1.11 still depends on hoe 1.8.1 or better. It is a marked as a development dependency, but those don't work as expected with rubygems < 1.3.0.

dependencies: 
- !ruby/object:Gem::Dependency 
  name: hoe
  type: :development
  version_requirement: 
  version_requirements: !ruby/object:Gem::Requirement 
    requirements: 
    - - ">="
      - !ruby/object:Gem::Version 
        version: 1.8.1
    version: 

If I'm missing something here then please reopen and let me know, but the lack of hoe 1.8.1 was causing real problems for me when working with rspec and related tools this weekend.
