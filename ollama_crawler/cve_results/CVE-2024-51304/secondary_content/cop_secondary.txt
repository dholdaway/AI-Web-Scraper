We also continued to enhance our portfolio by opportunistically acquiring the remaining 50% of Surmont, reaching a final investment decision on the Willow project in Alaska and further progressing our global LNG strategy. We remain committed to our Triple Mandate of responsibly and reliably meeting energy transition pathway demand, delivering competitive returns on and of capital, and achieving our net-zero operational emissions ambition. Our deep, durable, and diversified portfolio continues to generate robust cash flow, enabling us to start the year with a $9 billion return of capital target.” Full-year summary and recent announcements•Generated cash provided by operating activities of $20.0 billion and cash from operations (CFO) of $21.3 billion. •Distributed $11.0 billion to shareholders through a three-tier framework, including $5.6 billion through the ordinary dividend and variable return of cash (VROC) and $5.4 billion through share repurchases.  •Achieved 17% return on capital employed; 19% cash-adjusted return on capital employed. •Ended the year with cash and short-term investments of $6.9 billion.•Delivered record full-year total company and Lower 48 production of 1,826 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED) and 1,067 MBOED, respectively.  •Acquired the remaining 50% interest in Surmont for approximately $2.7 billion as well as future contingent payments of up to $0.4 billion CAD ($0.3 billion).•Made final investment decision (FID) on the Willow project. •Progressed global LNG strategy through expansion in Qatar, FID at Port Arthur LNG, regasification agreements in the Netherlands and offtake agreements in Mexico.  •Reached first production at several subsea tiebacks in Norway, Surmont Pad 267 in Canada and Bohai Phase 4B in China.  •Commenced startup at the second phase of Montney’s central processing facility in Canada.  •Awarded Gold Standard Pathway designation by Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0. •Accelerated the company’s GHG emissions-intensity reduction target through 2030 from 40-50% to 50-60%, using a 2016 baseline.The following information was filed by Conocophillips (COP) on Thursday, February 8, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.

 Inside Conocophillips's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
We regularly assess and, if required, establish accruals for uncertain tax positions that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where we operate.



 Other - Other   Highlight
In addition, prohibition of direct investment in some nations, national fiscal terms, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base.

 Legal - Other   Highlight
We accrue for losses associated with legal claims when such losses are considered probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
If our credit ratings are downgraded from their current levels, it could increase the cost of corporate debt available to us and restrict our access to the commercial paper markets.
