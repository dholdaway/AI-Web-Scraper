Financial Results and Corporate Updates 
 
Amtagvi™ (lifileucel) U.S. Launch Fully
Underway Following U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Approval as the First and Only One-Time, Individualized T cell Therapy for
a Solid Tumor Cancer
 
Amtagvi Regulatory Submissions on Track in the
European Union, United Kingdom, and Canada 
 
Amtagvi Patients Identified at Nearly All of
the 30 Authorized Treatment Centers (ATCs), with Approximately 50 ATCs Anticipated to be Ready by the End of May 2024
 
SAN CARLOS, Calif., February 28, 2024 -- Iovance
Biotherapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: IOVA), a commercial biotechnology company focused on innovating, developing, and delivering novel polyclonal
tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapies for patients with cancer, today reported fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results
and corporate updates. 
 
Frederick Vogt, Ph.D., J.D., Interim President and Chief Executive
Officer of Iovance, stated, “Throughout 2023, we executed toward our first approval and commercial launch while advancing our pipeline.
We are seeing healthy demand and momentum for Amtagvi™ following the recent U.S. FDA approval in advanced melanoma. To expand the
launch globally, we plan to submit regulatory dossiers in the European Union in the first half of 2024 and in Canada and the United Kingdom
in the second half of 2024. We are also excited about our robust development pipeline across solid tumor cancers. As a fully integrated
company, Iovance is well positioned to execute on our regulatory, pipeline, manufacturing, and commercial launch activities to advance
our mission to remain the global leader in TIL therapy.” 
 
Recent and Fourth Quarter
2023 Highlights and Corporate Updates 
 
Amtagvi™ (lifileucel): 
 
U.S. Approval and Launch Highlights in Advanced Melanoma 

·The
                                            U.S. FDA approved Amtagvi on February 16, 2024, as the first treatment option for
                                            advanced melanoma after anti-PD-1 and targeted therapy. Amtagvi is also the first FDA-approved
                                            T cell therapy for a solid tumor indication.

·Onboarding is complete at approximately 30 U.S. authorized treatment centers
(ATCs) and approximately 50 ATCs are expected to be onboard by the end of May 2024. 

·The Iovance Cell Therapy Center (iCTC) began commercial manufacturing
for Amtagvi patients within a week of approval. The iCTC, and a nearby FDA-approved contract manufacturer, are built today for
capacity for several thousands of patients annually.

·The U.S. launch of Amtagvi, and additional sales of Proleukin® used with
the treatment regimen, are expected to drive significant revenue for Iovance in 2024.

·Since approval, there are at least 20 Amtagvi patients in process, which
includes 10 patients already registered in IovanceCaresTM with scheduled or pending manufacturing slots.

 Inside Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
●Potency: We are exploring potential approaches to increase potency of the final TIL product through sorting and selection of specific TIL, such CD39/69 double-negative TIL, and the use of certain inhibitors or other reagents in TIL expansion cultures.



 Other - Other   Highlight
We review intangible assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances have occurred which could indicate that the carrying value of the assets are not recoverable.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
These arrangements may be material individually, and in the event that milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements were reached in the same period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in any one period.

 Other - Other   Highlight
In addition, it reflects a $31.4 million increase in cash used by assets and liabilities driven primarily by changes in accruals and accounts payable as well as prepaid assets, resulting from the increased workforce, overall growth in the business and operations, and the timing of vendor invoicing and related payments.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
The increase of $69.1 million in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to a $48.1 million increase in net loss related to increased costs in research and development, including the overall expansion of our clinical trials for new TIL cell therapies as well as our pre-commercialization activities for lifileucel, and the overall growth in our workforce and corporate infrastructure.
