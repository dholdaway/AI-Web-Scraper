This _is_ a duplicate of #45154 but I think this warrants some extra attention since that bug is
1) about 6 years old, and
2) the last comment from 3 years ago makes sense but is unanswered

I would like to be able to install the mysql client tools only, and not the server. I have at least 5 installations that could benefit from a "clientonly" USE-flag or similar solution.

Reproducible: Always

I always thought the "minimal" use flag served this purpose, as the metadata.xml specifies that "minimal" is "Install client programs only, no server". After examining the ebuild (and installing with just the "minimal" use flag), it compiles client+server.

However, this link may still be relevant: http://forums.mysql.com/read.php?117,267445,267706#msg-267706

If it is indeed the case, then the MySQL team must hide the pain they went through to produce the split client and server rpms.

USE=minimal provides what you need.

It does pass in --without-server for the minimal compile, so if you find it still compiling the server, please reopen the bug.
