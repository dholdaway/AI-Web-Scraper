Please add attachments instead of using pastebin services.

Adding archs to CC is *only* for stabilization and keywording.

So to be clear, you have successfully emerged it but now you have runtime problems?

The only thing I can think of is to back up and remove .xmind, then restart the application. Other than that, I have no idea what the issue could be, I can't reproduce it at all.

I deleted the users home ".xmind" directory, and the problem remains. 
What kind of a java version do you have running ?!


eselect java-vm list gives me:

  [1]   icedtea-bin-6 
  [2]   jre 
  [3]   oracle-jdk-bin-1.7  system-vm user-vm
