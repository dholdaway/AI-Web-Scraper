 Inside Penumbra Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Any revision of our estimates of potential liability could have a material impact on our financial position and operating results.



 Legal - Other   Highlight
Circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in the business climate or legal factors, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, change in customers, target market and strategy, unanticipated competition, loss of key personnel, or change in reporting units.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
We follow FASB ASC 740-10 “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” that prescribes a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on our income tax returns, and also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalty accrual, accounting in interim periods, and disclosure requirements.

 Financial - Shares   Highlight
If we require or elect to raise additional funds, we may do so through equity or debt financing, which may not be available on favorable terms, could result in dilution to our stockholders and could require us to agree to covenants that limit our operating flexibility.

 Other - Other   Highlight
We have established reserves to address potential exposures related to tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities.
