          2016-03-23 18:39:18 UTC
        

When logging in via sddm/lxdm there is a black screen with cursor.

.xsession-errors says: kdeinit5_wrapper: Warning: connect(/run/user/1000/kdeinit5_0) failed: : Connection refused

The above file exists but when trying to cat it I get "No such device or address"

How about ls -l /run/user/1000 ?

I rebooted the system and successfully logged in. AFAIR ls -l /run/user/1000 said everything had rw for owner, but I can be mistaken.

If you can reproduce it, feel free to reopen.

I reproduced it but cannot tell the exact steps. Seems that it reproduces after some period of idle time with nobody logging in.

Also, removind pam use flag from sddm seems to fix the problem, but I've had 2 freezes of sddm this way (same after some idle time). I assume this needs to have a separate bug report?
