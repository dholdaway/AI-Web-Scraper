Description


Michael Mol

If I try to cp a file onto a filesystem that has insufficient disk space, I get an error such as this:

cp: writing ‘/boot/example.tar’: No space left on device
cp: failed to extend ‘/boot/example.tar’: No space left on device

If I use genkernel to install to a full /boot, I get this:

* ERROR: Could not copy the initramfs image to /boot!

My assumption was that something failed to build, and so the image file wasn't available to copy. Only took me an hour to realize the target filesystem was full...

This is an issue, but fixing it will be a low priority. If you could provide a patch to resolve this, it will be fixed sooner.

Genkernel should not squelch the no space left error, so it should be visible (I've certainly see it before).
