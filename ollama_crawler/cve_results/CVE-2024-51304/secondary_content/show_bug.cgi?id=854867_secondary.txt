Issue: app-shells/mcfly-0.5.13 fails to compile (lto).
Discovered on: amd64 (internal ref: lto_tinderbox)

NOTE:
This machine uses lto with CFLAGS=-flto -Werror=odr -Werror=lto-type-mismatch -Werror=strict-aliasing

As far as I can tell this is totally unrelated to LTO. Also, it compiles fine right now.

For unknown reasons, at that time I was asked to block bug 618550 for each issue from lto_tinderbox. The same applies to all bugs that block bug 618550 that looks to be unrelated to lto
