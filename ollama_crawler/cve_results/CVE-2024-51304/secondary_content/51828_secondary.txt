Motivation / Background
While working on #51765 I noticed that the Database mixin (now object) for generators has info about packages for Docker like libvips, curl, git etc. I thought that was strange because those are not dependencies of the database packages. So I came back to clean this up.
Detail
The database object has docker_build and docker_base methods which return a list of packages, including things not related to the database like git etc. It turns out they are only used by the ChangeGenerator. That generator needs them to create a regex that finds the right apt-get line in the Dockerfile and replace the current database package with the new package. So, the database object does not need to know about these other packages. It can just tell the change generator what its package is and the generator can build the right regex.
Additional information

The database object does not need to know about the other packages in the Dockerfile. This info is only needed for the change generator so lets move it there.
