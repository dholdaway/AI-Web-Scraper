WORKSFORME. Both 0.6.2{,-r1} compile fine on a stable x86 host. I'm not going to try a ~ARCH toolchain so that very well could be the problem.

+/- 0 vote for me. Others?

This also fails with USE=emacs (both 0.6.2 and 0.6.2-r1):

 * Compiling GNU Emacs Elisp files ...
/var/tmp/portage/dev-lang/gforth-0.6.2-r1/work/gforth-0.6.2/elc.4697 /var/tmp/portage/dev-lang/gforth-0.6.2-r1/work/gforth-0.6.2

In toplevel form:
gforth.el:62:15:Warning: `string-to-int' is an obsolete function (as of Emacs
    22.1); use `string-to-number' instead.
gforth.el:76:19:Error: Symbol's function definition is void: forth-emacs-older

 * batch-byte-compile failed                                             [ !! ]

It can be fixed easily, but I don't want to waste my time if the package is going away.

I've fixed this, to get it off my table.
This doesn't imply that I would want the package to stay.

Thanks ulm, sorry I have not got around to it yet. This is on my next p.mask round to happen in a couple of days due to many random issues. Also, looking at the version bump in bug 180918, maybe I can save this package.

Bah, that version bump doesn't look promising. I think it is a fork or something. Anyway, I'm back to undecided about this package. I can't find what is triggering the build failure. It worksforme in a ~amd64 chroot and a x86 host. /me shrugs. I think it will sit here for awhile unless someone else chimes in.

And I guess, we resolve this now as WORKSFORME, because I have tested it every way that I can and no one else has voted. (besides ulm and apparently this works enough for him to fix other things with it)
