aren't we supposed to be using the evdev driver only now?

i believe xf86-input-mouse and xf86-input-keyboard are deprecated.  why they aren't marked with a keyword, or masked i don't know.

i can't know much, as i have no keyboard/mouse in xorg 1.10.

evdev not allowed on Gentoo FreeBSD.

Do you have moused running? or try using /dev/ums0 (if your mouse is USB) for xorg.conf Device setting instead of /dev/sysmouse
