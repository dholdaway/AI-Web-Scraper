Description

Whitespace detection has false positives, currently following ebuilds (and maybe others):


   net-dns/djbdns/djbdns-1.05-r28.ebuild: Trailing whitespace error on line: 28
   sys-apps/baselayout-prefix/baselayout-prefix-1.12.14-r1.ebuild: Trailing whitespace error on line: 41

(In reply to Patrick Lauer from comment #0)
>    net-dns/djbdns/djbdns-1.05-r28.ebuild: Trailing whitespace error on line:
> 28
>    sys-apps/baselayout-prefix/baselayout-prefix-1.12.14-r1.ebuild: Trailing
> whitespace error on line: 41

Both of these unnecessarily escape the new line at the end of a multi-line statement. So, the space between the last work and the backslash appears as trailing whitespace.
