I would like to see this piece of software into portage. It is a driver for common webcams like Creative Blaster WebCam III.

Extract from website:

This is set of drivers for the OmniVision OV5xx series of chips. These are USB-only video capture chips used in many "webcam" devices, and some TV-capture devices. Any camera using the OV511/OV511+/OV518 and the OV6620/OV6630/OV7610/OV7620/OV7620AE image sensor should work. OV518+ cameras have limited support too (should be fully supported soon). TV-capture devices with the SAA7111A decoder are supported as well. It supports streaming and capture of color or monochrome video via the Video4Linux API. Most V4L apps are compatible with it, and it supports most image widths and heights that are multiples of 8.


You can find an installation overview here:

So, enable it in your kernel? 

CONFIG_USB_OV511
