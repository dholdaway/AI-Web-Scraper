it would be nice to have something similar to the component reports that the kde guys use for their bugzilla.

see here 

Report count by component and severity
http://bugs.kde.org/component-report.cgi?severity=1
Report count by component and priority
http://bugs.kde.org/component-report.cgi?priority=1

This could help people looking for something to do as they have another view on the current amount of bugs in the system. it would also give the respective maintainers an different (over)view of the current situation.

the source for component-report.cgi can be found at
http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/bugs/bugz/

i am no longer interested in having this...

these stats can (AFAIK) be created using the search form.
sorry to bother you guys...
