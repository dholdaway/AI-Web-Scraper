pw useradd mail doesn't work if group mail already exists... the user simply doesn't get added.

Reproducible: Always

look... this is a blocker... it prevents you from installing software.

kindly shut your trap... the page you linked me too doesn't change my opinion of this blocking usage of gentoo.

Kindly stop producing this useless noise here or you can have your account suspended if you wish. Noone's interested in your offensive comments.

Could the report please attach exact error, emerge --info and USE flags used as courier-authlib emerges just fine here.

(as AT g/fbsd)
the reporter write about "pw useradd mail" not working command. probably he is following some sort of howto/wiki that tell him to create the user/group "mail" for courier; actualy the user/group is automaticaly created by the ebuild itselft:

    enewuser mail -1 -1 /var/spool/mail

so there is not need to manualy create any user/group.

p.s.: as AT g/gfbsd i have checked net-libs/courier-authlib-0.59.2 on a clean stage3 g/fbsd and it compile and work correctly (with postfix), so this bugreport most probably it's a bogus.
