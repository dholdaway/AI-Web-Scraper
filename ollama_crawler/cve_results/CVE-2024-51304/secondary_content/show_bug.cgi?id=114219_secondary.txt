etc-update takes a long time to use when there are over a hundred config files
to update, and automerging isn't usually going to work for power users.

If users could automerge all config files in a directory like /etc/pam.d/ or
/etc/xinet.d/ -- directories where users may know they haven't changed any
config files--it would cut down on the hundred very quickly.

Reproducible: Always

Why not use dispatch-conf?

/etc/dispatch-conf.conf
<snip>
# Automerge files comprising only CVS interpolations (e.g. Header or Id)
# (yes or no)
replace-cvs=yes

# Automerge files comprising only whitespace and/or comments
# (yes or no)
replace-wscomments=yes

# Automerge files that the user hasn't modified
# (yes or no)
replace-unmodified=yes
</snip>
