Sales increased 7 percent to $39.3 billion in 2023, as compared with $36.6 billion in 2022. Fourth quarter and full year 2023 sales reflect continued strong demand for our products and services. Fourth quarter 2023 net loss totaled $535 million, or $3.54 per diluted share, and 2023 net earnings were $2.1 billion, or $13.53 per diluted share. Both periods include an after-tax charge on the B-21 program of $1.17 billion ($7.68 per diluted share for the full year) and an after-tax mark-to-market pension and OPB (“MTM”) expense of $316 million ($2.08 per diluted share for the full year).“Our team delivered a strong finish to the year in 2023. We generated free cash flow at the high end of our guidance range, significantly exceeded our sales guidance and beat EPS consensus absent the B-21 charge we identified as a possibility this time last year,” said Kathy Warden, chair, chief executive officer and president. “With sustained global demand for our products, our 2024 guidance reflects continued strong sales and earnings growth. In addition, we’re reaffirming our cash flow outlook for 2024 and 2025, with free cash flow expected to grow at a greater than 15 percent CAGR through 2026. Northrop Grumman’s solid performance, record backlog and differentiated portfolio support our outlook for robust cash generation and our plans to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders.”1 Non-GAAP measure - see definitions at the end of this earnings release.Northrop Grumman Corporation2980 Fairview Park Drive • Falls Church, VA 22042-4511news.northropgrumman.comThe following information was filed by Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC) on Thursday, January 25, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.
