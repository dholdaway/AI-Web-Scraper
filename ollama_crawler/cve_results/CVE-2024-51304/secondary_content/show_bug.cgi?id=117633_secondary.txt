This appears to be an autoconf bug, not a vte bug. vte only references a run path in files generated by aclocal or configure.  I do not see these warnings on my system.

Hi, i have the same question. I'm author of duplicate bug-122355 (very sorry for that) and i really don't know what to do with that error, i try with every version of vte, do emerge -e system, and it's still doesn't install;
i can't do 'emerge -uD world' , because it's always stops on vte :(
i don't understand what's wrong with autoconf ...:/

Please, help me! :-)
Have a nice day

I have found the solution: you should emerge autoconf 2.13 and all will be OK.

The next ~arch portage revision will auto repair evil rpaths and not bail. 
Maintainers should still fix the packages they maintain as portage will only die
with FEATURES=stricter (but that is a maintainer & QA problem) no longer security@

No longer a security issue with current stable portage, re-assigning to maintainer.
