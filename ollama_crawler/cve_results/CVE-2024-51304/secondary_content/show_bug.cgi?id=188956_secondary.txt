Compiling cairo with XCB use flag on (headless machine):

checking for xcb... no
no
checking whether cairo's XCB backend could be enabled... no (requires XCB http://xcb.freedesktop.org)
configure: error: requested XCB backend could not be enabled

Reproducible: Always

I just synced my portage tree and azureus no longer depends on cairo anywhere down the line.  I'm not sure whether this does or does not invalidate this bug due to dependency changes that were made inbetween these syncs.

Allow me to correct myself.  Cairo is still in the list of dependencies.

When doing an ''emerge xcb azureus'' instead of an ''emerge azureus'', xcb comes after cairo in the build order.  This is also due to this bug.

Sorry, cairo already depends on x11-misc/xcb w/ USE=xcb set, really don't see what you mean here.

Appearantly it needs to depend on xcb-utils instead, seeing as configure checks for xcb-render-util.

It already does depend on both, please read the ebuild already.
