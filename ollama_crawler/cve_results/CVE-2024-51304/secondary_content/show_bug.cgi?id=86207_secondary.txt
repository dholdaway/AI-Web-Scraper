I had only headacke trying to add to KDE or GNOME pilot-link and conduits.
Ebuild's simply do not compile, I did not introduce any hand compiled, build and installed packages.
I just gave up. I need to go with something that works and i have a bit more control over it...
I did get on manual install sync on the pilot, but from that point on, I could not install or merge gnome-pilot ebuild and so on and on...
conslusion, or get the whole desktop manager and apps and install it your self or put up with what you get from distribution ...
