I cannot see why these people are still allowed to vent their opinions and exert their detrimental influence in a Gentoo development channel. As far as I can tell, they are only using it to gang up on people and to spam about other projects they happen to work on. They all seem to have an access level 9.

I still don't feel "safe" in #gentoo-dev with these people around.

I will post some. In the mean time, I wonder why the burden of proof appears to rest on my shoulders. (The basic question really is why they have voice there at all.)

Because they are former developers with wide personal contacts in our project and also huge knowledge that we can benefit from. Some of them are also members of the Gentoo Foundation and we can't start taking privileges from them without solid proof just because somebody doesn't feel "safe".

Here's an example of Philantrop helping one of our new developers (#gentoo-dev, 2008-05-24, around 14:00). I checked the logs, he didn't talk much besides that:


13:32 <@Serkan> Is a revbump needed when fixing  * QA Notice: Pre-stripped files found (Sorry to reask but electricity was off suddenly)
13:36 <@araujo> I think it is
13:36 <+bonsaikitten> araujo: but then you force users to recompile for a cosmetic change
13:37 <@araujo> bonsaikitten, well, it is a QA change
13:37 <+bonsaikitten> araujo: mmh, want me to file around 500 bugs for that? ;)
13:38 <@araujo> not the point of this question
13:39 <@Blackb|rd> I think I'd look more for "what the user has on the system post-install" . If that changes, revbump
13:39 <+Philantrop> araujo, Serkan: What do we do unless the user has FEATURES="nostrip"? :)
13:39 <@Blackb|rd> Modulo trivial stuff like README typos and such.
13:40 <@Serkan> Philantrop: ?
13:41 <+bonsaikitten> for all users without nostrip the result looks the same, just the time when files are stripped differs
13:41 <+Philantrop> Serkan: Think about it: Unless the user has FEATURES="nostrip" set, the binaries will be stripped anyway. "strip" is the default.
13:42 <@Serkan> So the resulting binary may change for some users as bonsaikitten said then
13:42 <+Philantrop> Serkan: Thus, most users will most likely not benefit from a re-installation and if they would, they'd be smart enough to read the ChangeLog. :-)
13:43 -!- BedOS_Gui [n=povticha@85.170.116.5] has joined #gentoo-dev
13:49 <@Serkan> The conclusion is "no need for a revbump" I suppose
13:49 <+Philantrop> Serkan: I'd certainly say so, yes.
13:51 <@Serkan> Thanks for the help
13:52 <+Philantrop> Serkan: You're welcome. :-)

Apparently the three booted developers were "promised" a voice in #gentoo-dev:
20080521.log-18:50:39 @<musikc|work> i'm without email presently, can someone tell them that they have voice in here as promised?

I keep wondering what I am supposed to read into them being promised a voice in #gentoo-dev. The whole point of retiring them as developers was to not have them verbally abusing people in several channels, including #gentoo-dev.

I checked all of my #gentoo-dev logs for May 2008, and I didn't find anything else for that channel and month.

Quoting comment #3:
> just because somebody doesn't feel "safe".

I am sure that after thinking about this, you really really didn't mean to say that.

I don't understand. You wrote you don't feel "safe" yourself and it was the only reason you mentioned in your initial bug. It was the comment I was referring to. There were no logs attached yet.

Anyway. You have shown some examples of their behaviour. I see nothing that would justify taking Philantrop's access away. Please remove him from the bug summary until he actually does something bad. 

I don't care about the rest, I even think you are right in some cases but I don't want to comment on those further.

Fair enough. Admittedly, philantrop has behaved pretty well since his retirement.

I apologize that the message was so easily misunderstood. "... as promised" is a common US term with no deep meaning, often used instead of "as agreed", "as I said I would", etc. I did not swear to an oath of sorts that they would have voice. I did tell other developers after spb, rbrown, and philantrop were retired that I removed their +v in #-dev temporarily and intended to restore it after a couple of weeks. I was merely following through with my intentions.

The three former devs are welcome to participate in #-dev as long as they follow simple principles [CoC, etc] and contribute to development discussion.

Live from #gentoo-dev
12:36:07 @<Blackb|rd> Oh fscking great. Network does not come up on boot
                      anymore on a rpoductive machine (even though it exist,
                      can be strted by hand and is entered into runlevel
                      default. Thank you, OpenRC :((
12:37:37 +<spb> i would comment, but it seems superfluous
12:38:35 @<Blackb|rd> rc-status even shows them as stopped, but interactive
                      booting didn't ask me if I wanted it.
12:38:52 +<spb> i hope you have console access
12:38:59 @<Blackb|rd> Well, yeah
12:39:14 @<Blackb|rd> Still, I have twoo hundred users plus their bosses pissed
                      at me now
12:39:27 @<tove> is openrc stable nowadays?
12:39:38 +<spb> "see above"
12:39:49 @<Blackb|rd> tove: it's ~amd64 which is what I need to run for other
                      reasons
12:40:13 @<Blackb|rd> Now, a *fix* would be nice.
12:43:21 @<Blackb|rd> Ok, now it works. God knows why
12:44:04 @<Blackb|rd> I suspect rebooting often enough "fixed" it.
12:46:00 @<loki_val> Who should I suck up to to get access to an AMD64

12:53:18 @<rej> Blaming beta software helps.
12:53:19 +<UberLord> well, maybe it will help you to test things before they go
                     into production
12:53:26 @<Blackb|rd> UberLord: oh, but we did.
12:53:44 @<Blackb|rd> UberLord: it's just funny how the testing machine
                      rebooted N times without showing the same problem.

12:54:19 +<spb> thanks, don't mind if i do
12:55:09 @<Blackb|rd> UberLord: Whatever the openrc packages did with the
                      network symlinks was broken more ways than one. It bit me
                      on the test machine, where I fixed it by doing the
                      symlinking as it was expected to be; alas, that didn't
                      help with the production machine.
12:55:12 @<ferdy> wait... so UberLord can call someone a dumbass and spb can't
                  say his code sucks ?
12:55:29 +<spb> ferdy: uberlord isn't the root of all evil, remember
12:55:43 @<Blackb|rd> UberLord: besides, it would've been trivial to check in

                      doing whatever the magic was.

                      working if started by hand) isn't started.
12:57:08 @<Blackb|rd> UberLord: booting the machine, going interactive mode, I
                      wasn't asked about net.eth0 or net.eth1, rc-status showd
                      them both as being in the dfeault runlevel but stopped.
12:57:24 @<Blackb|rd> UberLord: That doesn't make any sense whatsoever to me.
12:58:05 @<Blackb|rd> UberLord: no network driver modules or funny udev stuff
                      going on, as far as I can tell. The cold/hotplug settings

Please be advised that rbrown’s voice in #gentoo-dev has been suspended today. Anyone who disagrees or wishes to discuss the matter should address the #gentoo-devrel channel or email Developer Relations. At this time developers are advised against giving rbrown voice again as it will be removed promptly for the greater good of the developer community.
The reasons for this removal are his consistent abrasive behavior and personal attacks on Gentoo developers. Excerpts have been provided in this bug.

No surprise seeing you here. No doubt this bug has now leaked all over the world.

That aside, BlackB|rd was being called a dumbass for complaining about deploying openrc on a production system. That would generally be a good reason to be called a dumbass, especially when using Gentoo.

I'd like to add that I personally don't ask for any measures against Uberlord. We don't have the same opinion on the matter and he prefers calling people names in discussions. I'm old enough to ignore the latter and live with the former.

Hey, leave your paranoia to yourself, your friends and your family. And stop spreading FUD.

As for leaking all over the world, of course it has and restricting it makes that all the more likely.  I have no idea why this bug would be restricted to developers since our policy is generally that these sorts of bugs are open unless they contain otherwise restricted information (e.g., from gentoo-core).  But I am not handling this bug so it is not my call.

Opening bug to public after first discussing with jer, who originally opened the bug. We see no reason for it to be developer only.

I take it that kind of attitude is acceptable?

He didn't initiate the incident, from what I can see.

And how does that change the fact that his behaviour was unacceptable?

May I ask how my replying to an early message from eroyf is somehow evil or wrong? I really don't think #-dev is ever completely on topic. I suspect just about everyone in there has gone off on random tangents at one time or another... And it was all of like, 2 minutes? about 8 messages? I don't think we were really disrupting anyone...

I hope you aren't roping me into some sort of hate campaign just because of my package manager of choice...

FYI, DevRel has acknowledged your request ferdy. We are reviewing the facts and discussing the matter. You can expect an official response within the next couple of days.

I contest the change that ferdy@gentoo.org originally made. This bug has never been about Uberlord.

Uberlord retired from the project of his own accord.

I left Gentoo on my own as well.

the premise for leaving the project isnt terribly relevant.  if you arent exhibiting proper behavior, then you lose voice privileges that were granted to you.

Assuming that your comment is directed at me, let me simply state that I nor anyone else implied you in this bug report. In detailing IRC logs, many people are mentioned and quoted in passing, as it were. Think nothing of it. As far as I am aware, Comment #0 as amended in comment #8 still stands. The Summary has been changed to reflect that.

More abusive behaviour from rbrown, this time on the dev-mailing-list.

http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.devel/56682/focus=57016

IMHO his access to post there should be removed.

FYI this has now been done for a 5 day period, as per the resolution of bug 228401 ( https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=228401 or http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=228401 )

Closing since there's been zero activity here for half a year. If you get more evidence that they are abusing their access to -dev, please reopen.
