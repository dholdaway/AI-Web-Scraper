During installation of dev-php/PEAR-DB the application "pear" from package
dev-php/PEAR-PEAR is used.
dev-php/PEAR-DB should depend on dev-php/PEAR-PEAR.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge --unmerge dev-php/PEAR-PEAR dev-php/PEAR-DB
2. emerge dev-php/PEAR-DB

Actual Results:  
Error message: "pear" not found.

Expected Results:  
Install PEAR-DB

Yes, any PEAR modules requires PEAR-PEAR, so don't uninstall it or install it
before any other PEAR modules. Otherwise, you can try the Gentoo PHP overlay
[1], which has pear use flag, ensuring that PEAR will get installed together w/
dev-lang/php.
