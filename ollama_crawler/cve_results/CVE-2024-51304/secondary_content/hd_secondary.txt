 Inside Home Depot Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
The valuation under the retail inventory method is based on a number of factors such as markups, markdowns, and inventory losses (or shrink).



 Other - Other   Highlight
The indentures governing the notes contain various customary covenants; however, none are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
The decrease in net sales for fiscal 2023 primarily reflects the impact of a negative comparable sales environment, primarily driven by a decrease in comparable customer transactions as well as the impact from lumber price deflation.

 Financial - Shares   Highlight
The net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of our 3.75% senior notes due February 15, 2024 and repurchases of shares of our common stock.

 Other - Other   Highlight
The decrease in comparable average ticket reflects U.S. commodity price deflation, which negatively impacted average ticket by approximately 145 basis points, driven primarily by lumber.
