For example, mysql-workbench currently has the dependency >=dev-libs/gtkmm-2.14, but I already have an ebuild for gtkmm from the 3.0 slot (gnome overlay).

checking for GNOME... no
configure: error: Package requirements (libglade-2.0 gtkmm-2.4 >= 2.8) were not met:

No package 'gtkmm-2.4' found

$ eix -e gtkmm
[I] dev-cpp/gtkmm
     Available versions:
        (1.2)   {M}1.2.9-r2
        (2.4)   2.18.2{tbz2} 2.20.3{tbz2} 2.22.0 (~)2.23.91[1]
        (3.0)   (~)2.99.6{tbz2}[1]
        {debug doc examples test}
     Installed versions:  2.99.6(3.0){tbz2}[1](13:38:39 03/18/11)(doc examples -test)
     Homepage:            http://www.gtkmm.org
     Description:         C++ interface for GTK+2

[1] "gnome" /var/lib/layman/gnome

Apparently inkscape is an example of an ebuild that has this corrected:

media-gfx/inkscape-0.48.0 (>=dev-cpp/gtkmm-2.18.0:2.4)

Reproducible: Always

A mail was already sent to gentoo-dev mailing list asking people to set proper slot in ebuilds, but this will take a lot of time (as there are a ton of ebuilds to fix)

In summary -> this is in progress (sad "LATER" resolution was dropped :-S)
