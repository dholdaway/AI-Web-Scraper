Just did a sync, attempted to update world, and got the following error.

Calculating world dependencies -!!! Digest verification failed:
!!! /usr/portage/sys-fs/udev/udev-119.ebuild
!!! Reason: Filesize does not match recorded size
!!! Got: 9858
!!! Expected: 9856
... done!

Same happened on 2 different boxes.  I did attempt to delete the ebuild file and resync a couple of times, resulting in the same error.  Server info from the last sync:

~ $emerge --sync 
>>> Starting rsync with rsync://134.68.220.97/gentoo-portage...
Welcome to hawk.gentoo.org
 
Server Address : 134.68.220.97
Contact Name   : mirror-admin@gentoo.org
Hardware       : 1 x Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 2.40GHz, 2019MB RAM
 
Let me know if you need anything else :)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.sync tree
2.attempt emerge -av --update --deep --newuse world, and have udev come up to be updated
3.delete the ebuild file, and resync, get the same error.




obviously, it never gets to removing a previous version of udev, so udev still works, so it's not a huge deal.

You could try a different rsync mirror. In the tree in CVS nothing appears to be wrong.

must have been something on that mirror, i just tried syncing again, it picked a different mirror, and it was fine.  although the world update no longer included udev, where when i got the error udev wanted to update.  strange.

Well, udev-119 is what should be stable for you now. Please reopen if the problem with the original mirror persists - maybe the mirror is bad.
