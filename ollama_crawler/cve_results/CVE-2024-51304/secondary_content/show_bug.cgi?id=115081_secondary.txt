~ # emerge -va libidn

These are the packages that I wold merge, in order:

Calculating dependencies ..done!
[ebuild  N    ] net-dns/libidn-0.5.15  +doc +emacs +java + nls 0 kb

No error. When answering "yes", compilation does not start, but an error message 
occurs, saying missing /usr/bin/java-config. With installation of dev-java/java-
config-1.2.11-r1, the error is fixed.

It seems that if USE="java" is set, libidn is dependent from java-config, and 
the ebuild should in that case set the respective dependency.

It depends on jdk/jre which depends on java-config. If you don't have java
config,  then emerge it and don't use --nodeps next time.
