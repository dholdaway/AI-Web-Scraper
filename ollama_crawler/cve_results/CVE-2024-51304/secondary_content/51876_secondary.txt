Motivation / Background
Ref #50759
The rdoc markdown parser does not currently parse multi-paragraph definition lists correctly. Instead of putting both paragraphs inside a single definition, only the first paragraph ends up in the definition and the second paragraph is rendered after the definition list as a code block.
Detail
Since 7.2 appears to be coming soon, this commit fixes the second paragraph rendering as a code block by turning it into a second definition. This doesn't strictly seem like the "correct" fix (compared to fixing the rdoc markdown parser) but it gives us the visual result that we want until rdoc is fixed.
Additional information

Before:

After:

I'm realizing I've been building locally using an rdoc with this commit ruby/rdoc@8f943bb which looks much better:

I'll see if there's any chance we could get an rdoc release with that commit

We can always point to a branch of rdoc to get the same results. Let me try that.

I think that won't work because the generated parser isn't checked into git: ruby/rdoc#1107
