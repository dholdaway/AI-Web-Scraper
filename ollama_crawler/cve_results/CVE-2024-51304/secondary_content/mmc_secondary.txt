 Inside Marsh Mclennan Companies, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
Given the unpredictability of E&O claims and of litigation that could arise from such claims, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s businesses, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows in a given quarterly or annual period.



 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
In addition, losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations and may require valuation allowances that affect the rate in a particular period, depending on estimates of the value of associated deferred tax assets which can be realized.

 Other - Other   Highlight
The Company is required to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios for the Credit Facility, which are evaluated quarterly.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
Interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates, both of which vary from time to time.

 Other - Other   Highlight
A valuation allowance was recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized.
