Description

If the PN ends with a number, the EXTRAVERSION is confusing.

Example:

ebuild: "xu4-sources-4.14.40-r137.ebuild"
resulting KV: "-4.14.40-xu4137"

expected: "-4.14.40-137-xu4" or "-4.14.40-xu4-137"

Looks correct to me

ebuild xu4-sources-4.14.40-r137.ebuild unpack

debug: KV: 4.14.40-xu4-r137
