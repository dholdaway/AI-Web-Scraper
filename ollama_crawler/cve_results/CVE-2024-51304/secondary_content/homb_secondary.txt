For HOMB, the biggest obstacles came in the form of the loss of income as a result of the actions from some individuals in West Texas that may prove to be unethical and potentially criminal. In addition, the FDIC 4th quarter surprise assessment to financial institutions to recover losses from failed banks, resulted in $13 million ($0.05 per share) expense for Home BancShares. Both of these events were out of HOMB’s control, and the first event is a matter for the court, so we won’t speculate on the damage. The second one we know is $0.05 per share. Excluding these events, I’m proud to say that we would have beat our goal of $400 million plus and earned over $2.00 per share,” said John Allison, Chairman and CEO of HOMB.The following information was filed by Home Bancshares Inc (HOMB) on Thursday, January 18, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.
