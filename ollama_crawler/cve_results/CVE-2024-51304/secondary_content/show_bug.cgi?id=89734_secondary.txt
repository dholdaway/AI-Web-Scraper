Startup:

XML Parsing Error: not well-formed
Location: chrome://browser/content/browser.xul
Line Number 1, Column 1:

//mozapps/content/plugins/pluginInstallerWizard.xul
^

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge mozilla-firefox
Actual Results:  
Too strict browser... restricting itself

Expected Results:  
Start firefox.

Is it possible after this problem is fixed to not recompile gecko again, but
just update this 'problem'?

I cannot reproduce the issue after system restart, this could be because firefox doesn't request the Wizard anymore or I was impatient.
