Description

If the current stable version of k3b is installed and KDE is installed using only KDE base, running K3bsetup freezes the PC. The current ~x86 will eventually show an error asking you if dcopserver is running.

The problem was fixed when I emerged kdeutils.

Apparently, kdesetup has a dependancy with kdeutils. This problem probably doesn show up for people using the normal, full blown KDE

Reproduction:
- Fress install of Gentoo 2006.0
- install KDE-base
- install K3b (k3b-0.12.14 currently stable)
- run k3bsetup

Error:
System freezes

Emerge KDEutils fixed the problem.I guess kdeutils should be added as a dependancy

dcopserver is part of kdelibs. And K3B for sure doesn't need kdeutils.


>Apparently, kdesetup has a dependancy with kdeutils.

I assume you mean k3bsetup. No, it hasn't.


This sounds more like you screwed dcopserver somehow.

dcop server has been killed for some reason, when this happens more often we need a proper crash report to find out what's going on
