 Operating profit increased 43% year-over-year, with operating profit margins expanding 230 basis points to 17.6% from 15.3%. 
 Diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 40% to $0.84, up from $0.60 in the comparable prior year quarter. 
 Record cash flow with $37.9 million in net cash provided by operations, increasing 28% over the prior year. 

 Full Year 2023 Highlights 

 Record total sales of $703.6 million, 24% higher than the prior year’s $565.6 million. 
 Software sales exceeded $42 million, increasing 27% year-over-year.

 Record cash flow with $110.1 million in net cash provided by operations. 

 Kenneth C. Bockhorst, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Our strong fourth quarter results capped off a stellar 2023 with continuing robust demand and operational execution. We delivered 24% sales growth in the fourth
              quarter with record operating profit margins of 17.6% and record cash flow. Shortly after year-end, we completed the tuck-in acquisition of select remote water monitoring assets, expanding the breadth of our smart water offerings in line with
              our strategic objectives. I want to thank the Badger Meter team for delivering another year of exceptional performance driven by their unrelenting commitment to our customers.” 
 Fourth Quarter Operating Results 
 Utility water sales increased 28% year-over-year with strong growth across the broad suite of digital smart water solutions. This includes robust adoption rates for our cellular AMI offering, including higher ORION® Cellular
              endpoint and BEACON® Software as a Service (SaaS) revenues, as well as increased E-Series® Ultrasonic meters sales. Higher water quality and pressure monitoring sales also contributed to the year-over-year sales
              increase.

 Inside Badger Meter Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Income   Highlight
Due to the ambiguity of tax laws within each jurisdiction, the judgment involved in evaluating and estimating certain tax positions, and how these estimates impact other taxing considerations, it is possible that our income tax positions could differ from actual payments made or benefits received.



 Financial - Expense   Highlight
A future change in circumstances with respect to these specific matters or with respect to sites formerly or currently owned or operated by the Company, off-site disposal locations used by the Company, and property owned by third parties that is near such sites, could result in future costs to the Company and such amounts could be material.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Although alternate sources of supply exist for these items, the loss of certain suppliers could temporarily disrupt operations in the short term.

 Other - Other   Highlight
The Company establishes valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets that are not likely to be realized.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 are expected to be in the $14.0-18.0 million range, but could vary depending on timing of projects, growth opportunities and the amount of assets purchased.
