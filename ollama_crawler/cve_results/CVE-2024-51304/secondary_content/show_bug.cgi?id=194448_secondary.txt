this is from the latest 1.0.15_rc2

[AO_ALSA] alsa-lib: confmisc.c:768:(parse_card) cannot find card '0'
[AO_ALSA] alsa-lib: conf.c:3510:(_snd_config_evaluate) function snd_func_card_driver returned error: No such device
[AO_ALSA] alsa-lib: confmisc.c:392:(snd_func_concat) error evaluating strings
[AO_ALSA] alsa-lib: conf.c:3510:(_snd_config_evaluate) function snd_func_concat returned error: No such device

[AO_ALSA] alsa-lib: conf.c:3510:(_snd_config_evaluate) function snd_func_refer returned error: No such device
[AO_ALSA] alsa-lib: conf.c:3982:(snd_config_expand) Evaluate error: No such device
[AO_ALSA] alsa-lib: pcm.c:2145:(snd_pcm_open_noupdate) Unknown PCM default
[AO_ALSA] Playback open error: No such device

command was: mplayer -ao alsa test.mpg

with alsa-lib-1.0.14 series the first line read

[AO_ALSA] alsa-lib: confmisc.c:768:(parse_card) cannot find card ''

When using pidgin + alsa, it crashes with the details @ bug #193003

Let's mark this as Cardoe Machine #1. I have this problem with MythTV (via alsa-lib) and mplayer via alsa-lib.

I have tested pidgin on this machine and receive the same error as in bug #193003.

I have two additional machines that this fails on with >=alsa-lib-1.0.14a with both module and compiled-in in-kernel versions of alsa. I have had success with 1.0.13, 1.0.14_rc1 and 1.0.14_rc2 of alsa-lib. Here are the specs for these machines:

#1 - Dell Inspiron 8100
Multimedia audio controller: ESS Technology ES1983S Maestro-3i PCI Audio Accelerator
Linux version 2.6.23-gentoo-r3

#2 - Gateway Solo 5300
Multimedia audio controller: ESS Technology ES1983S Maestro-3i PCI Audio Accelerator
Linux version 2.6.23-gentoo-r3

@cardoe:
Please let me know any additional information you require. I'd love to see this bug squashed.

Do you have a /etc/asound.conf or ~/.asoundrc ?

Is the content of /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf sane?

alsaconf , does that change things and make things works okey (backup /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf first)

Did you ever happen to figure out what was wrong Cardoe?

I just had the same problem, and was able to solve it by fixing the permissions of /dev/snd, in this case setting them to a+rwX. 

I still have a problem in that I can't modify volume, but I at least got the sound to work in the first place.

This specific error appears to have been resolved in 1.0.16. I'm going to leave the bug opened while I check though.
