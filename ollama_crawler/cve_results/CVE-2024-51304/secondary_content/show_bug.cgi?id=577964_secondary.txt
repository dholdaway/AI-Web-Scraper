The problem recreated in a VM

After selecting the en_IE.utf8 locale with "eselect locale set" during an install, left and right single quotation marks (and many others) are displayed as white boxes. The problem persists after the installation is finished. The problem only affects the console, it's not an issue in XTerm / Xfce Terminal.

I encountered the problem while installing Gentoo on bare metal and have also reproduced the problem in a virtual machine to produce the attached screenshot.
The install CD I'm using is install-amd64-minimal-20160317.iso. The stage3 tarball I'm using is stage3-amd64-20160317.tar.bz2. During the install I select the "default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop" profile.

In the attached screenshot I issue an incomplete mv command which generates left and right quotation marks in its output. I do this before and after the
"eselect locale set" to demonstrate the problem.

I haven't attached emerge --info or make.conf as nothing has been merged at the point that the problem occurs.

You probably need to load a console font that has support for those characters. See /etc/conf.d/consolefont, and the fonts in /usr/share/consolefonts.

Hi Mike

Yes, changing the console font worked. I installed media-fonts/terminus-font and media-fonts/unifont and they both display the extended characters correctly. I thought the default console font used to display them correctly but I could be wrong. Anyway, I'm perfectly happy with the terminus fonts. Thanks for your help!

Best regards,
Ivan
