Exhibit 99.1Alpine Immune Sciences Provides Corporate Update and Full Year 2023 Financial Results-- Clinical data on povetacicept in IgA nephropathy will be updated at the upcoming WCN meeting, including follow up at 80 mg and initial data at 240 mg SC once every four-weeks ---- Povetacicept advancing towards a pivotal phase 3 trial in IgA nephropathy and a phase 2 trial in systemic lupus erythematosus --SEATTLE, Washington - March 18, 2024 - Alpine Immune Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALPN), a leading clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on developing innovative treatments for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, today reported full year 2023 financial results and company highlights for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023.“2023 was a transformational year for Alpine, with initial IgA nephropathy (IgAN) data presented at the American Society of Nephrology Kidney Week 2023 suggesting a best-in-class profile for povetacicept, our next-generation dual BAFF/APRIL inhibitor. With our encouraging data set in IgAN, convenient once monthly dosing regimen, and strong balance sheet, we are rapidly advancing development of povetacicept as a potentially meaningful new therapeutic option for patients living with IgAN, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and multiple other autoantibody-related diseases,” said Mitchell H. Gold, MD, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Alpine.Dr. Gold continued, “Looking ahead, Alpine is well positioned for a year of meaningful catalysts, with multiple updates for povetacicept in IgAN and other indications, and the planned initiation of RAINIER, a pivotal phase 3 study of povetacicept in IgAN, and DENALI, a phase 2 study of povetacicept in SLE. In addition to updates on our clinical studies, we look forward to sharing translational data that further supports the best-in-class potential of povetacicept in multiple inflammatory diseases.”Fourth Quarter 2023 Corporate UpdatesPovetacicept (ALPN-303)•First clinical data in IgAN demonstrate that povetacicept 80 mg administered once every four-weeks (Q4W) reduced proteinuria (as assessed by urine protein to creatinine ratio, UPCR) by greater than 50% and was associated with stable renal function (as assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate, eGFR) at six months. In addition, povetacicept was well tolerated during subcutaneous administration, with no instances of IgG < 3 g/L, and no severe infections (2023 American Society of Nephrology Kidney Week).•In a model of murine experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis, povetacicept improved disease activity, with clinical scores superior to treatment with either the FcRn inhibitor efgartigimod or an anti-CD20 depleting antibody (2023 American Association of Neuromuscular & Electrodiagnostic Medicine Annual Meeting).•New translational data from povetacicept in systemic lupus erythematosus demonstrate that povetacicept, as compared to single BAFF or APRIL pathway inhibitors, more potently downregulates genes associated with activation in B cells and significantly reduces multiple disease parameters in a mouse model of lupus, more effectively than WT TACI-Fc or conventional B cell depletion (2023 American College of Rheumatology Convergence).•Throughout 2023, the Company presented multiple oral and poster presentations on povetacicept at scientific conferences.Corporate Updates•The Company plans to present additional data on povetacicept in IgA nephropathy, including follow up data from the 80 mg Q4W and initial data from the IgAN 240 mg Q4W dose cohorts, during a Late Breaking Abstract session at the World Congress of Nephrology 2024 on Monday, April 15th at 4:45 PM ET.•The Company plans to present new preclinical data on povetacicept, demonstrating its greater distribution to disease-related end organs compared with WT TACI-Ig, at the 14th European Lupus Meeting. These findings correlate with povetacicept’s improved efficacy in multiple preclinical disease models.The following information was filed by Alpine Immune Sciences, Inc. (ALPN) on Monday, March 18, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.

 Inside Alpine Immune Sciences, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Shares   Highlight
However, additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and if we raise additional funds through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities, it could result in dilution to our existing stockholders and increased fixed payment obligations.



 Revenue - Product   Highlight
A significant change in these assumptions and estimates could have a material impact on the timing and amount of revenue recognized in future periods.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
If factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, or if we decide to use a different valuation model, the stock-based compensation expense we recognize in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our financial statements.

 Other - Other   Highlight
We establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will expire before we are able to realize their benefits or that future deductibility is uncertain.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Further, inflation may affect our use of capital resources by increasing our cost of labor and clinical trial expenses.
