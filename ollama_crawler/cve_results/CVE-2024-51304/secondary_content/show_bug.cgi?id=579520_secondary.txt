It may be possible to solve this problem by using package.mask to
prevent one of those packages from being selected. However, it is also
possible that conflicting dependencies exist such that they are
impossible to satisfy simultaneously.  If such a conflict exists in
the dependencies of two different packages, then those packages can
not be installed simultaneously.

For more information, see MASKED PACKAGES section in the emerge man
page or refer to the Gentoo Handbook.

I'm going to have to agree... Bugzilla isn't really the place for this.  Forums or IRC are.  At a quick glance, they all look like they are pretty standard blockers.  I'll defer to someone else for closing this bug, but you should probably be seeking support on IRC/forums for this.

i search help in IRC/Forums but no lucky D:

only if someone can help, are some weird messages there, first full:

sudo emerge -j16 --with-bdeps=y -aUDNuv --autounmask --verbose-conflicts --backtrack=100000 @world
Contraseña: 

 * IMPORTANT: 22 news items need reading for repository 'gentoo'.
 * Use eselect news read to view new items.


These are the packages that would be merged, in reverse order:

Calculating dependencies... done!

It may be possible to solve this problem by using package.mask to
prevent one of those packages from being selected. However, it is also
possible that conflicting dependencies exist such that they are
impossible to satisfy simultaneously.  If such a conflict exists in
the dependencies of two different packages, then those packages can
not be installed simultaneously.

For more information, see MASKED PACKAGES section in the emerge man
page or refer to the Gentoo Handbook.

first is requesting bosst slot 1.57.0 but there no packages requesting that slot, the same with xorg-server ...

I think it's a stable media-sound/xmms2 trying to block on samba-3
while samba-4 also stable.

This looks correct. The fack emerge failed to find an upgrade path means
there is a blocker for new versions somewhere.

I suggest you to try --autounmask=n first to get clearer error message:

  sudo emerge -j16 --with-bdeps=y -aUDNuv --autounmask=n --verbose-conflicts --backtrack=100000 @world

The conflicts here are an attempt to pull instanle gtk+ from ::gnome:

Another suggestion is to hint portage which version of gtk+ you actually want.
The ::gnome version or ::gentoo one?

If the former putting the following entry to /etc/portage/package.mask :
 <x11-libs/gtk+-3.20.0:3

will make portage messages clearer who wants old package.

--exclude option confuses portage even more on what must not be rebuilt.
I suggest not to use it while you have upgrade conflicts.

Your current conflicts are:

  (x11-base/xorg-server-1.18.2:0/1.18.2::gentoo, ebuild scheduled for merge) pulled in by
  (x11-base/xorg-server-1.18.3:0/1.18.3::gentoo, installed) pulled in by

and

  (app-text/poppler-0.32.0:0/51::gentoo, ebuild scheduled for merge) pulled in 
  (app-text/poppler-0.42.0:0/59::gentoo, ebuild scheduled for merge) pulled in by

I suggest directing portage further with there 2 masks:

<x11-base/xorg-server-1.18.3
<app-text/poppler-0.42.0

and try to update again.

It should force upgrading these packages and rebuilding packages that depend on old versions.

It may be possible to solve this problem by using package.mask to
prevent one of those packages from being selected. However, it is also
possible that conflicting dependencies exist such that they are
impossible to satisfy simultaneously.  If such a conflict exists in
the dependencies of two different packages, then those packages can
not be installed simultaneously.

For more information, see MASKED PACKAGES section in the emerge man
page or refer to the Gentoo Handbook.


The following mask changes are necessary to proceed:

NOTE: The --autounmask-keep-masks option will prevent emerge
      from creating package.unmask or ** keyword changes.

Yes, it's expected. It should only make an error message clearer (although it might help slightly if --backtrack= value is small).

Try to disabled autounmasking for portage so it will stop considering
masked versions as available and explore upgrade path among desired versions:

    --autounmask=n

Hi again, well now only left one block pkgs:

[blocks B      ] <dev-util/gdbus-codegen-2.48.0 ("<dev-util/gdbus-codegen-2.48.0" is blocking dev-libs/glib-2.48.0)

Yeah, two more masks to go:

<dev-libs/glib-2.48.0
<dev-util/gdbus-codegen-2.48.0

It will likely require ~arch keywording dev-util/gdbus-codegen-2.48.0

FYI, we are working on a proper fix since the same bug keep popping up, see bug #580788
