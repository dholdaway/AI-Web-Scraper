Selecting a Python version less than 3 makes this compile just fine. Also, earlier versions of geany-plugins did not seem to have this problem.

Reproducible: Always

Please re-sync again. =geany-plugins-1.24 has been replaced by =geany-plugins-1.24-r1 which takes care of correct python implementation being used.

-r1 working fine. Thanks for the fix.
