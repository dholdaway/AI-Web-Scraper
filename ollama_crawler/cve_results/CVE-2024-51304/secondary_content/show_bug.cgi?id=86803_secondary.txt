maybe it's me but that patch doesnt seem to work right ...

before:
root     tty1                          Mon Mar 21 20:19   still logged in   
runlevel (to lvl 3)   2.6.12-rc1       Mon Mar 21 15:21 - 00:11 (7+08:49)   
reboot   system boot  2.6.12-rc1       Mon Mar 21 15:21         (7+08:49)   
shutdown system down  2.6.11           Mon Mar 21 18:07 - 00:11 (7+06:03)   
runlevel (to lvl 0)   2.6.11           Mon Mar 21 18:07 - 18:07  (00:00)    

after:
root     tty1                          Mon Mar 21 20:19   still logged in   
runlevel (to lvl 3)   2.6.12-rc1       Mon Mar 21 15:21 - 00:18 (7+08:57)   
reboot   system boot  2.6.12-rc1       Mon Mar 21 15:21         (7+08:57)   
shutdown system down  2.6.11           Mon Mar 21 18:07 - 15:21  (-2:-45)   
runlevel (to lvl 0)   2.6.11           Mon Mar 21 18:07 - 18:07  (00:00)

it seems your system went down at 18:07 and then went up at 15:21 on the same day, so the output is correct, it is your system clock that is messed up.

How does this work for you? With 2.86-r8 I am still seeing the same behaviour.
