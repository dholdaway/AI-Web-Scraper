Description

I believe the dependencies in the freecol 0.5.3 ebuild is not complete.  I got error messages about a missing native2ascii when attempting to upgrade freecol.  I upgraded ant to 1.7.0, and the problem disappeared.

I'm very sorry that this bug report is rather thin - I don't know what version of ant I had before the upgrade, nor if the error appeared due to local inconsistensies or because the ant version was too old.

Probably

Probably what?  Probably I had local inconsistencies, or probably the ant version was too old?

The ebuild doesn't specify any minimum version of ant - it probably should.  If the problem was due to too old version of ant, this is a bug in the ebuild IMO.

The eldest ant-ebuild I have is 1.6.5, I tried downgrading to 1.6.5 and recompile freecol - I succeeded, so I guess it's OK to leave this resolved as for now.
