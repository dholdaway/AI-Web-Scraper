 Inside Everi Holdings Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
If our assumptions regarding business plans, competitive environments, anticipated growth rates, or expectations of results of operations and financial condition are not correct, we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods, whether in connection with our next annual impairment testing process, or earlier, in the event an indicator of impairment is present at such time during the year.



 Other - Other   Highlight
The SEC has defined critical accounting estimates as those that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the registrant.

 Other - Other   Highlight
We expect the financial services and payments industry to respond to these changes, including in ways that could negatively impact our FinTech business in the future.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Changes in forecasted operations can significantly impact these estimates, which could materially affect our results of operations.
