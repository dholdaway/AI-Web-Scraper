The package does not contain "/usr/share/mythtv/metadata/Television/ttvdb.py" anymore and so tv metadata lookup always fails.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Trigger metadata lookup with "mythmetadatalookup --refresh-all-artwork"
2. Result: Movie grabber not functional.  Aborting this run.

or

1. Metadata lookup for just recorded show
2. Result: MythSystemLegacy() command not executable
Actual Results:  
Metadata lookup does not work.

Expected Results:  
Metadata lookup should work.

Seems to be fixed in media-tv/mythtv-31.0-r5.

Thanks, bug can be closed.
