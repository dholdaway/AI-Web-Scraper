Description


Itamar Croitoru





          2009-03-13 17:20:59 UTC
        

I installed Gentoo 2008.0 using offline only with command line installer.  Gnome did not correctly get added.  I emerged KDE and it runs fine.  I tried to do 'emerge gnome' and on the package x11-libs/vtw-0.16.14 I run into 6 'ACCESS DENIED' errors for the following files:
/usr/share/pygtk/2.0/codegen/argtypes.pyc
/usr/share/pygtk/2.0/codegen/definitions.pyc
/usr/share/pygtk/2.0/codegen/defsparser.pyc
/usr/share/pygtk/2.0/codegen/scmexpr.pyc
/usr/share/pygtk/2.0/codegen/override.pyc
/usr/share/pygtk/2.0/codegen/reversewrapper.pyc

When I check the files they have "-rw-r--r--".

I have also tried to emerge x11-libs/vte-0.16.14 on it's own and get the exact same results.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
As I list in the desc.

Actual Results:  
It fails to emerge.

Expected Results:  
It should have emerged.

Please post your "emerge --info" and attach the build.log file.

Reopen this bug when you provide the requested information.

It will not allow me to attach an empty file so I cannot provide you with the build.log file.

The important part are the exact ACCESS DENIED error messages. Please post them into this bug.

I emerged it again and directed the output to a file this time.

The errors happen on lines 931-936.

Incase this makes any difference this Gentoo is installed on a Dell Latititude D610 hardware.

this is most likely because those file don't exist or were not generated by the normal installation process and hence ebuilds trying to use this will all fail trying to generate these.

the files do exist.  How can I test if they were created correctly?

if the files do exists, maybe their timestamp is lower than the original. Please do a ls -l /usr/share/pygtk/2.0/codegen/*

sounds like I forgot that this folder shouldn't exist anymore if you are using >=pygtk-2.12.1-r2 (which you really should). What's your pygtk version ? Could you try >=pygtk-2.12.1-r2 (or reinstall it if needs be) and tell us if it fixes your issue ?

      Latest version available: 2.12.1-r2
      Latest version installed: 2.12.0

This is my output.  I will try now to upgrade and see what happens.

Considering that my installation was default maybe you should have the detault move up to R2?

I have completed the upgrade and I now have vte installed.

Thank you very much.
