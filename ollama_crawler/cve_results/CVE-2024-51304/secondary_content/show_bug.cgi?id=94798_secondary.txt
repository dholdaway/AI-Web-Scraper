Hi,

after the dvdrip update I've some problems if I try to encode a SVCD:

I searched for export_mp2enc.so but found nothing on my disk. What happend to this file? Which package should I install to get this file?

Try setting USE="mjpeg" and rebuild transcode using "emerge --oneshot
transcode". Does this solve the missing file issue?

Hm, I had a drive crash last month and after I reinstalled Gentoo, the DVD::Rip
problem has gone. There was perhaps a incompatibility with some version that
currently aren't installed.

Sorry for bothering you...

How should the status of this bug set? Resolved?

Andreas

Yeah, or WORKSFORME (although I had the same issue, fixed it by setting mjpeg as
a USE flag).

0.52.6 is in tree, this went away by itself
