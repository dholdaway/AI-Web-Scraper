I tried to play a Cd-Audioi or a DVD-Video but I received a message that says that the source is not available, or I have no permission toread.
The DVD are new one and old one.
If I mount the DVD or CD unit, I can read and use (and burn...) data, but video e audio doesn't works if I try to read a DVD with mplayer with this command:
mplayer /dvd/VIDEO_TS/VTS01_0.VOB or 
mplayer dvd:///dvd/VIDEO_TS/VTS01_0.VOB I read:
libdvdread: Using libdvdcss version 1.2.8 for DVD access
libdvdread: Could not open /dev/dvd with libdvdcss.
libdvdread: Can't open /dev/dvd for reading
Impossible to open the device DVD: /dev/dvd
/dev/dvd is a soft link to /dev/hdd



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.kaffeine (0.5): open DVD
2.totem: play disc
3.  mplayer dvd://1

Actual Results:  
I cannot see any kind of DVD

Expected Results:  
That all works like athlonXP

Please use "New -> Gentoo Linux -> Component: Ebuilds" in future. Infrastructure is not the correct addressee.

No CD-Audio, DVD-VIdeo or S-VCD are available....

You are in disk group? (see 'id' for that)

the users are in the disk group (from /etc/group).
If I try to access to DVD as root I can, but as user I can't access the device

Paste id output.
/etc/groups is not enough as you need to logout and re-login to make the changes effective.

A reboot did nothing: root can always access to the device, the users no!
If I change the permission to 666 the users can access the device too. But this is not a good security answer.

I asked you to post the output of 'id' command.

id user: uid=1000(pinna) gid=100(users) gruppi=6(disk),7(lp),10(wheel),18(audio),19(cdrom),27(video),35(games),80(cdrw),99(burning),100(users)
id root: uid=0(root) gid=0(root) gruppi=0(root),1(bin),2(daemon),3(sys),4(adm),6(disk),10(wheel),11(floppy),18(audio),20(dialout),26(tape),27(video),99(burning)

In every case, I can access as user to the DVD only with mplayer, and with mplayer, xine and kaffeine as root. 
Totem doesn't work.

Any news on this problem? 
At the beginning you said mplayer didn't work, but in the last comment you 
said it works, is it correct? 
 
Also, you should post your 'emerge info'
