Description

I would like to install x11-libs/libnotify without pulling any notification daemon, because I use my own notification server (bundled in my own window manager) and I don't want another one to take precedence.

There doesn't seem to be a way of doing this at the moment, because it is assumed that absolutely all notification servers are listed in the potential dependencies of virtual/notification-daemon, and that libnotify doesn't make sense without a notification server so it has to pull one, even with USE=-*.

While I understand that it's convenient for most users (and probably for maintainers too) to simply have virtual/notification-daemon as a PDEPEND of x11-libs/libnotify, a library is still just a library, and I feel I should be able to install it without pulling an application in some way (especially one that depends one the said library).

If I didn't miss something obvious and that it is indeed not possible yet, I suggest adding the "server" or "daemon" USE flag (or a new "notification-daemon") to x11-libs/libnotify, which would be selected by default. That wouldn't change anything for most users, and would give the flexibility to run with an out-of-tree notification server.

This might be a use-case for package.provided[1], since you're installing out-of-tree software that would normally be in the RDEPEND of virtual/notification-daemon. Be wary of the warning at the top of the wiki page though: if you do this, you're stepping outside of what developers may be willing to support.

I wasn't aware of package.provided and it does seem like a safe workaround in that situation, thanks!
