Description

I'm attaching the output I receive when running subversion (or anything that relates to it).

I get very similar output when trying to start apache, either directly or with the init script: http://dpaste.com/36021/ (I didn't include it here, because it's over 5,000 lines long!). Although it doesn't seem to make either program fail, it heavily increases the amount of time the programs take to finish (especially, `svn co [something]`), and if the program fails the error output is simply lost in these messages.

Reproducible: Always




This happens regardless of what other programs I have running in the background. Things I've tried to rectify it:
emerge -auDNv world;
Taking debugging symbols out of the kernel config, recompiling and re-installing it;
revdep-rebuild;
removing the debug flag and re-compiling.

My make.conf looks like this:

# These settings were set by the catalyst build script that automatically
# built this stage.
# Please consult /etc/make.conf.example for a more detailed example.
CFLAGS="-O2 -march=i686 -pipe -ggdb"
CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"
FEATURES="nostrip metadata-transfer"
# WARNING: Changing your CHOST is not something that should be done lightly.
# Please consult http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/change-chost.xml before changing.
CHOST="i686-pc-linux-gnu"

# Speed up the compile process (Why didn't I set this before?)
MAKEOPTS="-j2"

# Packages to compile against, pull in dependancies for etc.
# Basically, configure my packages for me.
USE="-minimal -gnome -gtk -raptor qt3 qt4 kde kde4 hal X opengl dbus dvd cdr xine webkit soprano xext xsync xcomposite nsplugin ogg oss pdf php javascript xcb glitz v4l v4l2 msn wifi spell quicktime dvdread imap pop imagemagic jpeg gif png alsa nsplugin plasma samba sysvipc tiff videoscddb bzip2 css cups svg dri ffmpeg mpeg xvid encode cdinstall a52 aac accessibility bash-completion strigi sdl mysql dv firefox mime apache2 ruby perl unicode xcb semantic-desktop usb win32codecs vorbis mad oss nvidia openmp fluxbox qt3support ldap java spamassassin mng kdeprefix mp3 mp4 bittorrent libwww laptop debug xscreensaver addressbook geolocation htmlhandbook bluetooth cupsddk ppds foomaticdb nfs network rss google-gadgets snmp mono embedded print printer scanner disk-partition monolithic grub xinerama wma truetype akonadi"

# Pull in correct language packages

# Sync from a closer (faster) mirror

I don't have any overlays installed, but am using ~x86.
The only GCC version I have installed is, "[1] i686-pc-linux-gnu-4.3.3 *".

If I recall correctly you need to build dev-libs/apr without the debug use-flag.

Excelent! That fixed it. Thank you very much. I'm going to do some research into what dev-libs/apr actually does.

Marking as, "WORKSFORME".
