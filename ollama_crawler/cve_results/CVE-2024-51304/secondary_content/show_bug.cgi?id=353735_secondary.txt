activitymanager widget is not in the list of available widgets. as far as i can see the .desktop file of the widget doesn't look proper as well. there's only a "Hidden=true" in the file.

Reproducible: Always

Not sure if there is actually a bug here. Activity management seems to work fine. 

If you can document somehow what exactly is missing, please reopen.
