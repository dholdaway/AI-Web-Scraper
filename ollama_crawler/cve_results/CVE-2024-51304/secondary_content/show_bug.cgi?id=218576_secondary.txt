Since I have upgraded to baselayout-2.0.0 on ~x86 my laptop does not power off. It appears according to alt+sysrq+i no more processes are left in the runlevel and that the syslog-ng was the last process to be quit. Maybe related to bug #218572?

I don't think it is baselayout2 related, it happend to me before with the latest stable baselayout on amd64. I just upgraded to baselayout2 and will report back if this happens again.

Personally I think it is somehow related with suspend-to-ram/suspend-to-disk.

I do not use suspend-to-ram nor suspend-to-disk. It powers off fine if I shutdown xdm first and then do 'init 0'.

Although I do not understand why kernel says 'no more processes in this runlevel'. But maybe still in a runlevel 1 or 2 or 3? Who knows?

the kernel doesnt know anything about runlevels.  that message is coming from the sysvinit binary.

The power-off goes fine when I shutdown openvpn before 'init 6'.

I don't see how bug#218570 is related.

The problem with shutdown is gone with upgrade to some of these:

x11-wm/fvwm-2.5.25
x11-apps/xinit-1.0.8-r3
sys-apps/busybox-1.10.1-r2
app-shells/bash-3.2_p39
dev-libs/libevent-1.4.3

Hello, you should also update to >=sys-apps/sysvinit-2.86-r11. It includes support for baselayout-2.

Needless to say I haven't seen this issue since a loong time. I believe it
really disappeared with the upgrades mentioned in comment #8.
