forums.gentoo.org breaks down all the time, You write at a thread just to have no connection any more. This is for days now. It is no fun at all!

When looking around gentoo.org about some information about it, there is no!
Just a thread in the forums guessing what this is about ....

And just to mention here: cia service is shutdown.


Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
Please give users some information about the state of forums.gentoo.org!

Also
blogs.gentoo.org/zmedico/2012/09/12/experimental-eapi-5_pre2/
Blogs serving infrustructure is down grounded at the moment.

I insist: The main bug really is no status of service update somewhere at
www.gentoo.org

A general note: Just putting various things you have noticed into a bug is not a  particularly good idea.

The forums service is currently having a quite varying availability, we are aware of that and are constantly working on improving the uptime. There is no particular issue to fix, thus this bug isn't needed for tracking. I'll close it therefore.

An infra status overview is in the works.

Completely unrelated to the forums. We have already noticed that. The gentoo-cvs list continues to list all tree and most overlay commits, replacing CIA.

Again unrelated to forums, the site is up for me.

Yeah well, it's not, again. Now for the sixth time today it gives a 503.

There are enough people on the forums having and reporting this problem, I'd like to link it, but well, site's down and I don't know the post-id.
