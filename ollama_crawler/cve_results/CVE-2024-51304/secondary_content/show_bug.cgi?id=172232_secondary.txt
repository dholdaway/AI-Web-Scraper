Hello, I propose that media-video/mplayer ebuild need of splitting encode and decode flags. For example, I may need ONLY internal faad and mp3lib, but encode x264. In this situation and current ebuild there will be installed lame and faac, which I don't need :(. I propose flags aac-encode and mp3-encode for encoding and usual aac and mp3 for decoding.

PS. Sorry for my very BAD english

We already have the encode use flag for that very purpose.  If you have encode + aac, it will pull in faac.

Fixed the use flag checks a bit though to pull in twolame only if encode is set.

But I want +encode (for xvid/x264) and faad/mp3lib BUT without faac/lame

So; you've replaced mp3 with lame and aac with faac and introduced a totally redundant mp3lib use flag which is doing exactly the same what mp3 has been doing until now. Kindly explain what kind of sense does this make.

Until then, WORKSFORME, absolutely no need to confuse users.
