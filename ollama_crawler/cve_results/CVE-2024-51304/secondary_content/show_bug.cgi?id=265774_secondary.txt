net-analyzer/pnp4nagios-0.4.13 installs "/etc/rc.d/init.d/npcd".
I am informed that on a gentoo system this directory should not exist.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Emerge net-analyzer/pnp4nagios-0.4.13
Actual Results:  
Check your /etc/rc.d/init.d directory  If this exists things may not have been installed correctly


Expected Results:  
No /etc/rc.d/init.d directory
