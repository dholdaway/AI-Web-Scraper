Roland, are you still around?  I sent you a few emails regarding the SIMD
extensions to Eterm and heard nothing in response.  Since this Meta bug is four
months old and no-one has added anything else to it I suggest that it is closed
now.  It seems that the SIMD extension issues are being handled in the
individual packages.

indeed, i don't think we need a tracker bug where all real bugs are closed
