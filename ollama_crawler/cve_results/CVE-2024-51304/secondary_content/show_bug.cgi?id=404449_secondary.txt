slim fails to start xfce4 without xterm installed due to this in the default /etc/slim.conf:

console_cmd         /usr/bin/xterm -C -fg white -bg black +sb -T "Console login" -e /bin/sh -c "/bin/cat /etc/issue; exec /bin/login"

Should slim depend on xterm?

No, slim should not depend on xterm.  If anything, the default config file wound need to be adjusted.

The "console_cmd" option is used to specify what action to take when you type 'console' at the login prompt, and as far as I am aware has nothing to do with regular slim usage (when you would be logging into Xfce).  I will test this to confirm in a minute, but I expect that your issue lies elsewhere..

confirmed, slim login does not need xterm.  If you cannot log into xfce, there must be something else wrong with your setup.  

Potential issues:
- your default xsession is not set, via /etc/env.d/90xsession (see gentoo xorg config guide)
- you have an invalid ~/.xsession or ~/.xinitrc
- you are still missing parts of xfce.

If you would like help debugging, #gentoo on irc is a good place to look, or you can email me directly.

Thanks Ian.  Weird that emerging xterm fixed it, but I'm sure you're right.
