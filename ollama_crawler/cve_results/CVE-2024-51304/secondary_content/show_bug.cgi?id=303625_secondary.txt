I understand there was some migration to a monolithic poppler and this caused the following breakage for me:

emerge: there are no ebuilds built with USE flags to satisfy "~app-text/poppler-0.12.3[xpdf-headers,lcms]".
!!! One of the following packages is required to complete your request:
- app-text/poppler-0.12.3-r3 (Change USE: +xpdf-headers)
(dependency required by "virtual/poppler-0.12.3-r1" [ebuild])
(dependency required by "kde-base/okular-4.3.3" [ebuild])
(dependency required by "world" [argument])


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Attempt to emerge --update --deep --with-bdeps y --reinstall changed-use  --verbose --ask world
2. Portage kicks you back to prompt with the above error message

Created attachment 218563 [details]
Proposed ebuild solution..

I modified an ebuild (currently marked stable on amd64) to stop this issue.

the only reason I can think of that you would see that error is if you explicitly disabled the xpdf-headers USE flag in app-text/poppler (either by setting "app-text/poppler -xpdf-headers" in package.use or by setting USE="-*" in make.conf).  In all other cases, that should be set by default via IUSE defaults (as the ebuild properly declares IUSE="... +xpdf-headers").
