Works for me now:

2016-04-24 18:53:52 (1.32 MB/s) - ‘/usr/portage/distfiles/thunderbird-bin_x86_64-45.0.tar.bz2’ saved [42774013/42774013]

But I remember that there are sometimes problems with the mozilla server. 
I am not sure, if we may mirror mozilla software...
If the problem occurs often, we could add an info text for users like:
"Gentoo mirrors are not allowed to provide the requested file and the mozilla fileserver seems to be down so please try again later."

But the mozilla team will know more about it...

We may not mirror the mozilla distfiles for firefox-bin and thunderbird-bin, which is why we have RESTRICT="mirror" in the ebuilds.  

FYI, though, this was in fact a bug due to an upstream configuration change -- the double-slash in the URL between 'releases' and '45.0' used to be non-fatal but now is, and I have corrected the URI's in the ebuilds to ensure this issue doesn't recur.
