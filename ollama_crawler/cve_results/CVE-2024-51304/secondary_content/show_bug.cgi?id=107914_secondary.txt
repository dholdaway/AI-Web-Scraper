Hello, I emerged the masked package sonic-snap on AMD64 and it seems to work for
me without error.

I used a M6215 webcam using the USB sn9c102 driver. The version of sonic-snap
was sonic-snap-1.5, the only one in portage.

I used two webcams at the same time and it worked. 

Reproducible: Always

Hmm? It's marked ~amd64; can't go to stable until maintainer marks it stable.
