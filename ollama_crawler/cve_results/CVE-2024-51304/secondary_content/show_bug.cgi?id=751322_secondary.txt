Issue: media-libs/kvazaar-2.0.0 uses -Werror for build.
Discovered on: amd64 (internal ref: tinderbox)

-Werror is not recommended for releases and should always be disabled when encountered in build-logs, because there are numerous cases where this breaks without purpose.

NOTE: If you want to change the summary, to avoid auto-filed duplicates, please at least keep the word '-Werror'

As far as I can tell, there's no Werror in use.
