The attached file is a line which I have within my /var/log/messages of my ThinkPad T400. Unfortunateley that's why less won't show that file as text :-(

Probably the linux kernel (2.6.26.4) shouldn't produce such kernel log lines OTOH less shouldn't be confused by it, or ?



Reproducible: Always

either the kernel needs fixing (to not put non-printable ascii into the log buffer), or your logging process was corrupt (and you should fsck/etc...)

either way, this is operating correctly -- non-printable ascii means binary file no matter how you dice it

$ file log
log: data
$ hexdump -C log | grep '^[^|]* 0'
00000040  20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20  20 20 20 20 20 20 01 20  |              . |
