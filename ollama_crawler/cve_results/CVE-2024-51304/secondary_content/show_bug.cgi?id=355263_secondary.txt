Description


Xake





          2011-02-16 22:47:12 UTC
        

I have a nfs4-fileserver, and want to be able to reach it by just "ls -l /net/liten.local/srv".
The problem is that even when /etc/auto.net gives nfs4 as filesystem, automount fails to parse the options, resulting in automount trying to sned mount.nfs the default (i.e. nfs) fstype which fails.

In the following output, take special note on "lookup_mount: lookup(hosts):" and also what fstype /etc/auto.net shows compared to what mount.nfs are being sent.

Looking closer at it it seems like the problem is in the lookup_mount routine for "host". If you compare to "file" which in this case is for the following configure:
/etc/auto.master: /imports /etc/auto.imports
/etc/auto.imports: liten	-fstype=nfs4,rw,soft,timeout=30	liten.local:/

This configuration gives the following output:

handle_packet: type = 3
handle_packet_missing_indirect: token 29, name liten, request pid 14310
attempting to mount entry /imports/liten
lookup_mount: lookup(file): looking up liten

Please provide as well the following information:
1a) Is '/etc/init.d/autofs' service running?
1b) If it is not running, does starting this service help?
2) Have you set protocol accordingly to use nfs4 in /etc/conf.d/autofs?
3) Please attach the involved configuration files to this bug as I can hardly follow what is in which file.

Eh, I ran the service by hand in the same way as the initscript does, because I needed the "-d" option for output

> 1b) If it is not running, does starting this service help?
No, because it has the same problem, and adding -d to the initscript shows the same fault in the logs.

Makes no difference, same faults in logs.

The configuration I am trying is the exact same as shipped with autofs.
"emerge autofs && /etc/init.d/autofs start && ls -l /net/<hostame>/<sharename>" is supposed to mount and show the exported directory in question, by using /etc/auto.net to lookup the host and what shares it exports.
Changing the default in /etc/conf.d/autofs gives the same message (which indicates that it still tries to mount nfs3).
Changing the default fstype in /etc/auto.net from nfs to nfs4 changes nothing too, since as shown in c# 1 this is not parsed to begin with.
I could go through what the different with autofs shipped config-files are supposed to do if you need a refresh.



A nf4 working configuration for my setup I can obtain by:
echo /imports /etc/auto.imports >> /etc/auto.master && \
echo liten \-fstype=nfs4 liten.local:/ && \
/etc/init.d/autofs reload && \
ls -l /imports/liten/srv

I had a thorough look at your problem. As I understood your problem is:

1) You have the following entry in your auto.master config file:
'/net    /etc/autofs/auto.net'

2) You have configured your nfs server to export a directory which is not '/'.

3) You have changed the fstype in auto.net to be '-fstype=nfs4'

4) Accessing files of the export via /net/<server>/<share> fails.

Please check whether above mentioned is describing your setup corrrectly.
If I described your setup correctly, then unfortunately I can't do anything about the situation.
Have a look at the following thread on upstream's mailing list: http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.autofs/5824/

If your issue is different from above mentioned, please let me know what I missed and I will have a look again.

Yes, it does
I have also as stated tried with MOUNT_NFS_DEFAULT_PROTOCOL=4 which did not help either.

Why? Point 3 (i.e. autofs does not parse the options set in auto.net) is at least according to documentation a bug.
Also, should not MOUNT_NFS_DEFAULT_PROTOCOL=4 at least try to force nfsv4 first, before trying nfsv3?

Well, I do not think this is the same issue.

Also that issue is from RedHat, and RedHat is based on fedora, right?
On my Fedora14 box (same configuration files as in Gentoo out of the box):
[xake@meddli ~]$ ls -l /net/liten.local/srv
totalt 56

However on my Gentoo box:
xake@lillen ~ $ ls -l /net/liten.local/srv
ls: /net/liten.local/srv: Filen eller katalogen finns inte
ls: kan inte öppna katalog /net/liten.local/srv: Filen eller katalogen finns inte
(i.e. The file or directory does not exist)

Okay. I was able to reproduce the situation mentioned above, so I was pretty sure this is same.

That's really good news as we can use this box to find out what's different to the Gentoo install.
If you are willing to help me, I'd be really happy as I don't have access to a Fedora box.

Yes, that's what I get on my test setup as well when using nfs4 to access an export which is not '/' and set fsid=0 property in /etc/exports.
Using nfs3 the mount is successful. This is exactly what is discussed on mentioned upstream's mailing list.

To start further examination, could you please provide
1) relevant entry of `/etc/exports` on liten.local providing the export
2) output of `showmount -e liten.local`
3) diff of auto.net between Fedora and Gentoo install (if there is any)

No matter if I have fsid set or not, it does not difference.

This is the only entry
/srv 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0(rw,no_subtree_check,async)
> 2) output of `showmount -e liten.local`
$ showmount -e liten.local
Export list for liten.local:
/srv 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0
(same on both Gentoo and Fedora)
> 3) diff of auto.net between Fedora and Gentoo install (if there is any)

No differences, both seems to be the upstream provided.

Ok, after taking another look at my setup I found out some things I should have done differently, and for some reason fedora "just handled".

What I can say is that there is a bug in autofs upstream, namely that it ignores the options set in /etc/auto.net
But my problem was probably local, which makes this bug to noisy to track the actual bug.

If you like to explain what the problem was, it would be great if Gentoo as well 'just handles' this :-)

Well, for me it does not. If I put -fstype=nfs4, I get 'File not found' error when having a an export not referring to / but deeper in the tree. This is due to the fact that 'showmount -e' will give you the full path to the export in the tree like /foo/bar/baz. With nfs4, you will not access this export under /net/<server>/foo/bar/baz but /net/<server>/baz.
Exporting / results in a valid nfs4 mount for me.

For some reason the mounting command Fedora used (i.e. -t nfs) was able to mount the directory while on Gentoo I got "Protocol not supported" (or something like that) and since I cannot really rule out that it is something in the configuration on my nfs-client, I do not really know what to say.

Okay. Then we everything stays as is.
Thanks for reporting anyway.
