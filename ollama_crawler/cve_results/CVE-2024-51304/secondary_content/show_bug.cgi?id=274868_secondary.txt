Okay I admit I'm not 100% sure that this is the case but it seems to me that repoman is currently not checking for size of files in sub-directories of $FILESDIR. So this is a request to check this out mostly :)

Thanks,
Diego

When checking this out, it works and thus gives a fatal error:

     $ mkdir files/test
     $ dd if=/dev/urandom of=files/test/test bs=1M count=2
    2+0 records in
    2+0 records out
    2097152 bytes (2.1 MB) copied, 0.258748 s, 8.1 MB/s
     $ repoman full

    RepoMan scours the neighborhood...
    !!! A file is not listed in the Manifest: 'dev-java/jnr-ffi/files/test/test'
      manifest.bad                  1
       dev-java/jnr-ffi/Manifest
      file.size.fatal               1
       (2048 KiB) dev-java/jnr-ffi/files/test/test

    Note: use --include-dev (-d) to check dependencies for 'dev' profiles

    Please fix these important QA issues first.
    RepoMan sez: "Make your QA payment on time and you'll never see the likes of
    me."

Furthermore, looking at http://packages.gentooexperimental.org/repoman-current-issues.txt we get to see two such files that confirm this for cvs added files:

    (24 KiB) dev-libs/mpfr/files/3.1.0/patch07
    (22 KiB) x11-misc/xorg-cf-files/files/xorg-cf-files-1.0.2-solaris-prefix.patch
