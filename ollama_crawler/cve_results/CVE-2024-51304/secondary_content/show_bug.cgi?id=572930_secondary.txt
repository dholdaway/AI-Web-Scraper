Something broke here and it's super annoying because I'd actually like to fix some recently discovered vulnerabilities in Gentoo.

Please do not break common tools that worked before.
I guess this has to do with the changes to metadata.dtd.

Please fix or get reverted.

Note: use --include-dev (-d) to check dependencies for 'dev' profiles

Please fix these important QA issues first.
