Unless otherwise stated, all comparisons are to the same period of fiscal 2023.CEO Comments“We finished fiscal 2024 with solid fourth-quarter performance including sequential volume improvement and margin expansion versus prior year and delivered significant progress against our longer-term strategic plan despite an evolving consumer landscape,” said Campbell’s President and CEO, Mark Clouse. “I’d like to thank the entire Campbell's team for finding ways to deliver solid results in this dynamic environment. The strength of the Meals & Beverages recovery, including Soup, was a standout in the quarter as was the competitive advantage of our supply chain. The integration of Sovos Brands is progressing ahead of our expectations, marking a transformative shift in our Meals & Beverages growth trajectory. We’ve also advanced our Snacks margin journey, while delivering significant innovation and improved sales and marketing capabilities. All of this provides continued confidence in our ability to deliver sequential progress in fiscal 2025 as we continue to navigate the steady and ongoing recovery in the industry. More importantly, as we look ahead, we are strengthening our conviction in our longer-term outlook driven by our advantaged market-leading brands, capabilities and execution.
