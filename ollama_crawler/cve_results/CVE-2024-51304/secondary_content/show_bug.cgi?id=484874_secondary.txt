Description


Agostino Sarubbo






          2013-09-14 07:55:07 UTC
        

You receive this bug because this package does not respect my system's CC (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-gcc) and calls directly /usr/bin/gcc(or similar)
The possible solutions to fix this issue are:
1)Fix the buildsystem, if you can;
2)inherit toolchain-funcs and use tc-export CC
3)inherit toolchain-funcs and use emake CC="$(tc-getCC)"


From the build log:

gcc -march=native -O2 -g0 -pipe -fPIC -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -o udns_dn.lo -c udns_dn.c
