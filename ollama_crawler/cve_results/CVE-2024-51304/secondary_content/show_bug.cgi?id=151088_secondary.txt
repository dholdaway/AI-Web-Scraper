Description

These two patches allows to compile gxine with the libmozjs.so included with Firefox/Seamonkey. It still supports dev-lang/spidermonkey as the last available dependency.

gxine-ebuild-0.5.7.patch:
 - Adds the autotools eclass
 - Adds the support for firefox/seamonkey flags
 - Uses eautoreconf instead of elibtoolize: the seamonkey patch modifies the m4/_js.m4 file from the source

gxine-0.5.7-seamonkey.patch
 - Adds the --enable-seajs flag to configure

I've tested both 0.5.7 and 0.5.8 releases in a stable x86 installation.

Did you send this upstream?

No, I didn't send it upstream. Should I? :-)

This patch was applied upstream, version 0.5.9 and up. Please close this bug when some version equal or greater than 0.5.9 of gxine is marked as stable.

It seemes it's there now as automatic dependency which should be fixed:

Patch for gxine-0.5.11.ebuild.

The updated version of this patch adds the USE keywords firefox, seamonkey and spidermonkey, and stops the automatic dependency reported by betelgeuse

Comment on attachment 116573 [details, diff]
Patch for gxine-0.5.11.ebuild.

I've tested 0.5.905 with xulrunner installed and this problem seems to have auto-resolved itself. The plug-in and gxine binary is only linked to spidermonkey's lib like expected. Firefox and Seamonkey doesn't provide headers to link against anymore...
