I tried many times to install the 2.4.30-r3 openmosix-sources (following the
gentoo openmosix guide) in a sata hard drive until I found out that they don't
have sata support, as is reported in

It's not bug.
I installed linux-2.4.30-r3 openmosix-sources on MB Intel D955XBK, P4 (3.0 GHz) with SATA Samsung 160 Gb.
BIOS setting SATA <Enabled>, Configure SATA as <IDE>,
config setting: 
Needed enable SATA MB chipset support in SCSI low level drivers, for me "Silicon Image SATA support". "Serial ATA support", Intel PIIX/ICH SATA support are enable too.
