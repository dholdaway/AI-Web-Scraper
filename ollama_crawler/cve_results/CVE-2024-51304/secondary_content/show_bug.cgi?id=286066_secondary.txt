It looks I have some remnant on my system from 1.83-r1 ebuild. How about others?

clustalw2 is for clustalw-2*
clustalw is for slot one. please upgrade the clustalw SLOT 1 and report back if this issue still happens.

Looks my skills are only up to something like "emerge --unmerge =sci-biology/clustalw-1.83-r1". That's not what you wanted, right? ;-)

sci-biology/clustalw-1.83-r1 isn't in the tree anymore, means it isn't supported anymore.
If you want to have help for clustalw version 2*, do

clustalw2 -help

for version 1*, make sure you have either 1.83-r2 or r3 emerged and than use

clustalw -help.
