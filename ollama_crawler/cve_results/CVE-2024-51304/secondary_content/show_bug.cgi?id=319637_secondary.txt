Description

The document (and it's translations) related to this bug report (compare URL) refers to setting LC_* values to locale de_DE.UTF-8.

While this works at first sight, random strage errors occure. The reason is that the locale setting should *not* read de_DE.UTF-8 but de_DE.utf8!

Please correct.

Many greets and thanks,
Hans-Jürgen

PS. i don't know how to but if this thingy has been a wiki or something editable like that i'd have corrected this issue by myself ;)

Reproducible: Always

can you give an example of one "random failure" to reproduce, please?

"ramdom failures" were logins to different machines via ssh where sometimes some characters (german umlauts) didn't work. Further investigation showed that this was not a local issue but a remote one (locale of remote machine not configured correctly).

Please excuse and don't change the documentation the way i suggested before.

I'd like to suggest an improvement for the mentioned documentation:

* add de_DE.UTF-8 to "Code Listing 3.7: Adding locales to /etc/locale.gen"
(mine contained de_DE.utf8 which lead me to the wrong assumption that it *must* be de_DE.utf8)

* Add a note that "the output of 'locale -a' shows utf8 instead of UTF-8" at the end of section 3 near "You can verify that your selected locales are available by running locale -a."

Works for me as-is. No need to note any differences from one locale to the other. They work just fine no matter how you put 'em in.
