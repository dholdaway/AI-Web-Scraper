Serge,

Thanks for your bug report.  In future, it helps the developers greatly if you quote the exact error message you receive.  This would have included the missing file name, and directed us towards the overlay first, rather than the main tree.  This issue has now been fixed in the overlay.  Thanks...  5:)
