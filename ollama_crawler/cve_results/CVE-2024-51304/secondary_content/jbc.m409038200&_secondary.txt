This differentiation process requires spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression in the endoderm by a network of tissue-specific transcription factors whose elucidation is far from complete. These factors include the Onecut protein hepatocyte nuclear factor-6 (HNF-6), which controls pancreas and liver development as shown in our previous work on Hnf6 knock-out embryos. In mammals, HNF-6 has two paralogs, Onecut-2 …Save Cite Cited by 54 Related articles All 8 versions  PrivacyTermsHelpAbout ScholarSearch help
