im-ja compiles and installs fine, and shows up in gtk-query-immodules-2.0:
"/usr/lib/gtk-2.0/2.4.0/immodules/im-ja.so"
"im-ja" "Japanese" "im-ja" "/usr/share/locale" "ja"

However, Japanese doesn't show up in the Input Methods list!  Moreover, I have im-ja set as my default Input Method (GTK_IM_MODULE="im-ja").  The XIM server works, but is a real pain.  It will randomly stop working for a single application.  Switching input methods to Default then back to XIM fixes this.  However, as Firefox and Thunderbird don't allow you to set the Input Method, I have to restart them (using LC_ALL="ja_JP.UTF-8").  I have this problem on both x86_64 and x86, using both the version 1.3_r1 in portage and the 1.3 version from CVS.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install im-ja (via either portage or CVS)
2. Attempt to switch Input Method to Japanese

Actual Results:  
Japanese was not listed in the Input Methods menu

Expected Results:  
Japanese being listed in the Input Methods menu

i doubt firefox & thunderbird can be considered full gtk+ apps.

True.  But im-ja worked in them before, as it did with full GTK+ programs.  I'll try emerging older versions of im-ja to see if they might work, but I think I'll prolly get the missing im-ja.so problem if I do.  However, my roommate is on an x86 box... he's sleeping now, but I'll check later and see if 1.3 works for him (he hasn't updated in a while).

Yeah, if you need Gecko based browsers, try kazehakase.
You can change input methods with that browser.
(You cannot do so with mozilla and firefox)

Does the problem still persist with im-ja-1.4?
I cannot reproduce the problem (it works without any problem).
