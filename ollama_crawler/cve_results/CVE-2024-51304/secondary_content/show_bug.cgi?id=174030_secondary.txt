While the nvidia homepage seems to be totally out of date, you can see in the forum that:
http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=81668

Has been released, i would like it to be merged in to gentoo, it would make it easier for ppl like me who currently run a older beta just to have support for the  laptops Geforce 4 go.

Reproducible: Always

So, Lets remove nvidia-legacy-drivers then, since it serves no purpose.
