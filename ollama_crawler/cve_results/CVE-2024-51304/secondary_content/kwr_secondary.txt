 Inside Quaker Chemical Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Legal - Other   Highlight
(l)The impacts of certain discrete tax items include certain impacts of tax law changes, valuation allowance adjustments, uncertain tax positions and prior year true-ups, and the impact on certain intercompany asset transfers.



 Other - Other   Highlight
Both determinations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Notwithstanding the results of the Company’s impairment assessments during 2023, if the Company is unable to maintain the actions aimed at improving the financial performance of the EMEA reporting unit, or interest rates continue to rise, which leads to an increase in the cost of capital, then these conditions could result in a triggering event for the EMEA reporting unit.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Accounts receivable and inventory exposures: The Company establishes allowances for credit losses for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
However, the Company may also be subject to other taxes, such as withholding taxes and dividend distribution taxes, if certain undistributed earnings are ultimately remitted to the U.S.
