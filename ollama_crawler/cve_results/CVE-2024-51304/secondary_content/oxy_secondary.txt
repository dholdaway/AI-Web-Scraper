Item 2.02

Results of Operations and Financial Condition.





On January 4, 2023, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (“Occidental” or the “Company”) provided a financial and operational update. The information set
        forth under “Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure” is incorporated herein by reference.




Item 7.01

Regulation FD Disclosure.





Financial Update


During the fourth quarter of 2022, Occidental completed its $3 billion share repurchase program and took steps to further improve its balance sheet.


Following the third quarter 2022 earnings call, Occidental repaid approximately $940 million of debt and retired $450 million of notional interest rate
        swaps for approximately $170 million in cash.


During fiscal year 2022, Occidental repaid over $10.5 billion of debt, including over $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, reducing the face value of
        its debt to below $18 billion. Occidental has now retired all outstanding interest rate swaps.


Operational Update


The late December 2022 North American Winter Storm Elliott resulted in third party and company operated downtime, primarily related to compression,
        that impacted Occidental’s domestic onshore operations. While normal operations have resumed, average Permian and Rockies production in the fourth quarter of 2022 is expected to be impacted by a combined 10 Mboe per day (thousands of barrels
        equivalent per day).


The information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K (“Current Report”) shall not be deemed to be “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the
        Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and shall not be incorporated by reference into any filings made by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as may be expressly set
        forth by specific reference in such filing.


Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
 
This Current Report contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation
        Reform Act of 1995, including but not limited to statements about Occidental’s expectations, beliefs, plans or forecasts. All statements other than statements of historical fact are “forward-looking statements” for purposes of federal and state
        securities laws, and they include, but are not limited to: any statements of belief and any statements regarding the projected impact of Winter Storm Elliott. Words such as “project,” “expect” or similar expressions that convey the prospective
        nature of events or outcomes are generally indicative of forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Current Report. Unless legally required,
        Occidental does not undertake any obligation to update, modify or withdraw any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
 
Although Occidental believes that the expectations reflected in any of its forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results may differ from
        anticipated results, sometimes materially. Factors that could cause results to differ from those projected or assumed in any forward-looking statement include, but are not limited to those factors found in Occidental’s filings with the U.S.
        Securities and Exchange Commission, including Occidental’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K.
 




SIGNATURE
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the
        undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
