libgda-1.2.3 doesnt find firebird due to wrong path in ebuild. firebird is in /opt, not /usr. 

.... from ebuild:
pkg_setup() {
        G2CONF="$(use_with berkdb bdb /usr)    \
                $(use_with firebird firebird /usr) \

should read:
pkg_setup() {
        G2CONF="$(use_with berkdb bdb /usr)    \
                $(use_with firebird firebird /opt) \

I've tested libgda with firebird-1.5.2 and 1.5.3-r1 and I haven't seen the problem you describe. Firebird installs some symlinks that make the standard process of looking for the include and lib files under /usr work.

If you still see this problem, please re-open and attach the full emerge log. Thanks.
