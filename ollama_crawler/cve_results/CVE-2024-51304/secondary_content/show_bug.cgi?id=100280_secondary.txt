Description

See http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=5964031&forum_id=7093.

The upstream bug (with patch) seems to be affecting anjuta-1.2.2, making it
quite useless on PPC.

This version should be masked for both ~ppc and ppc .

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Run any command from the IDE, such as make
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Short warning;
** (anjuta:25603): WARNING **: Cannot execute command: "make -k"
nothing results

Expected Results:  
Command should have been parsed and executed.

Patch from Debian list. Has been applied upstream. Versions 1,2,3 and 2.0.x 
ebuilds in the pipeline (?), but are not in portage.

Anjuta 1.2.4 is now in portage, so my report is subsumed.

Note that the defect described as "Static Linking with wxGTK" at
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=7211626&forum_id=7092 is
still in; but this may be Anjuta's problem - The generated configure.in
contains this macro:

        if test "$wxWin" != 1; then
        AC_MSG_ERROR([
                wxWindows must be installed on your system.

                Please check that wx-config is in path, the directory
                where wxWindows libraries are installed (returned by
                'wx-config --libs' or 'wx-config --static --libs' command)
                is in LD_LIBRARY_PATH or equivalent variable and
                wxWindows version is 2.3.2 or above.
                ])
        else
               dnl Quick hack until wx-config does it
               ac_save_LIBS=$LIBS
               ac_save_CXXFLAGS=$CXXFLAGS
               LIBS=$WX_LIBS
               CXXFLAGS=$WX_CXXFLAGS
               AC_LANG_SAVE
               AC_LANG_CPLUSPLUS
               AC_TRY_LINK([#include <wx/wx.h>],
               [wxString test=""],
               ,[WX_LIBS=$WX_LIBS_STATIC])
               AC_LANG_RESTORE
               LIBS=$ac_save_LIBS
               CXXFLAGS=$ac_save_CXXFLAGS
        fi
 
which appears to always select WX_LIBS_STATIC
