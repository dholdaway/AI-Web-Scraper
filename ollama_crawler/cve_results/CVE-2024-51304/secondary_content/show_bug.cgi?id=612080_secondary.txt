I've been using it for a long time. Okay to stabilize?

On what arch? It already was stabilized months ago via bug #602088.

Apologies. I was looking at my sparc chroot and didn't realize it had been stabilized on other architectures. I'll just stabilize it on platforms I use, if you don't have any objections.

No need to keep the bug open in that case.
