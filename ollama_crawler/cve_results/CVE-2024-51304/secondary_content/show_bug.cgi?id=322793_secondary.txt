After editing mp3-tags i.e. via easytag and re-reading the libary, exaile doesn't read the changeing. He used the old set furthermore.
I need to delete the libary and a new reading.

p.s.: easytag is more comfortable.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Exaile
2. Re-read libary.
3. No change happens. Also after restart exaile.

Actual Results:  
Exaile doesn't read the mp3-tags.

Expected Results:  
He have to read the tags, because the libary is sorted by them.

Easytag doesn't update mtimes by default. 

You have to go to "Settings" -> "Preferences" -> "File Settings" -> "Update modification times..." and check that checkbox. 

Exaile needs this to detect file changes.

Close this bug as "WORKSFORME" or "INVALID" after you have verified this works. Thanks!

But you have to uncheck "Preserve modification time of the file" also.

Thx
