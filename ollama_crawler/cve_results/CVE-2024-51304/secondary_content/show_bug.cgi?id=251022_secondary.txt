Description

Consider the list of USE flags for kopete in use.local.desc. The first five are:
addbookmarks - Enable the addbookmarks plugin
alias - Enable the alias plugin
autoreplace - Enable the autoreplace plugin
connectionstatus - Builds Connection Status plugin
contactnotes - Enable the contactnotes plugin

None of those offer any clue to the user as to their purpose, and they're woefully typical.. When I'm considering installing a package, I want to know what each USE flag does - what's in it for me.

The Gentoo installation documents refer to "A full description [of] the available USE flags" in use.desc. This is just not true; all that's given, in far too many cases, is a repetition of the name of the flag: no help at all to the newcomer to the package.


Reproducible: Always

As we talked with jmbsvicetto on IRC maybe we can use descriptions in http://docs.kde.org/development/en/kdenetwork/kopete/plugins.html

Look at kde-base/kopete/metadata.xml, this appears to be fixed. If some description still doesn't please you, please reopen.
