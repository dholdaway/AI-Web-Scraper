style/argbhelper.cpp:#include "private/qwidget_p.h"

This could silently break even between Qt point releases.

As with bug 523616, we can introduce a subslot in qt5 and you can depend on ":5=", if you think it's worth it.

FTR, qt5 has a subslot since 5.6.0

I haven't seen any evidence of breakage yet that might indicate the need to use the subslot.
