Description

If you click your mouse anywhere in the graphical console window, the window will "grab" it and should write a message in the window title bar how to release the pointer.
But I didn't get the message and in ~/.virt-manager/virt-manager.log I found:
  File "/usr/share/virt-manager/virtManager/console.py", line 394, in get_grab_keys
    keystr = self.get_grab_keys()
...
  File "/usr/share/virt-manager/virtManager/console.py", line 394, in get_grab_keys
    keystr = self.get_grab_keys()
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded


Reproducible: Always




Found a debian patch named "0004-vnc-Fix-accidental-recursion-we-reporting-grab-keys.patch" for this on http://patch-tracker.debian.org/package/virt-manager/0.9.1-4

This patch works for me.

It should be fixed in virt-manager-0.9.4, give it a try and report back.
