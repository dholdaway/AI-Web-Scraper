Description

Recently, the nvidia-drivers-337 ebuild was removed from the tree
(http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers/nvidia-drivers-337.25.ebuild?view=markup)
and the suggested version to install is nvidia-drivers-331.
The problem is that nvidia-drivers-331 does not support 64-bit EGL.
(https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/732674/64-bit-libegl-so-missing-in-nvidia-linux-x86_64-331-67-run/)

The revdep-rebuild is unable to fix the issue.

It doesn't look like removing was necessary and it broke desktops running fine.
Is it possible to restore this version of drivers? (I cannot jump to 340 and newer because this branch don't support my GPU)

340.* should support that quite nicely. Why do you think it does not?

sorry, this is my mistake. I was under impression that legacy drivers are < 34xx
and masked everything newer. 
Just installed 340.x and it works fine here.
