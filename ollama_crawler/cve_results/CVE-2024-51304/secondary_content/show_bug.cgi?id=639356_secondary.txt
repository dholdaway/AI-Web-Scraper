World upgrade is failing due to gobject-introspection trying to pull in both python 2 and 3 through PYTHON_SINGLE_TARGET.

Please take note that "emerge --info" only shows:

PYTHON_SINGLE_TARGET="python3_5"

I didn't put this into make.conf, so I'm running with default values.

$ sudo emerge -DNua world

These are the packages that would be merged, in order:

Calculating dependencies... done!

!!! The ebuild selected to satisfy ">=dev-libs/gobject-introspection-1.34:=" has unmet requirements.
- dev-libs/gobject-introspection-1.50.0::gentoo USE="cairo -doctool -test" ABI_X86="(64)" PYTHON_SINGLE_TARGET="python2_7 python3_5 -python3_4" PYTHON_TARGETS="python2_7 python3_5 -python3_4"

  The following REQUIRED_USE flag constraints are unsatisfied:
    exactly-one-of ( python_single_target_python2_7 python_single_target_python3_4 python_single_target_python3_5 )

  The above constraints are a subset of the following complete expression:
    exactly-one-of ( python_single_target_python2_7 python_single_target_python3_4 python_single_target_python3_5 ) python_single_target_python2_7? ( python_targets_python2_7 ) python_single_target_python3_4? ( python_targets_python3_4 ) python_single_target_python3_5? ( python_targets_python3_5 ) test? ( cairo )

(dependency required by "media-libs/harfbuzz-1.4.6-r2::gentoo[introspection]" [installed])
(dependency required by "dev-qt/qtgui-5.9.3::gentoo" [installed])
(dependency required by "app-crypt/pinentry-1.0.0-r2::gentoo[qt5]" [installed])
(dependency required by "gnome-base/gnome-keyring-3.20.0::gentoo" [installed])
(dependency required by "sys-auth/pambase-20150213::gentoo[gnome-keyring]" [installed])
(dependency required by "sys-libs/pam-1.2.1::gentoo" [installed])
(dependency required by "sys-apps/busybox-1.25.1::gentoo[pam]" [installed])
(dependency required by "@system" [set])
(dependency required by "@world" [argument])

I can temporarily get around this with:

$ sudo PYTHON_SINGLE_TARGET="python3_5" emerge -DNua world

Then it works, but it will end up with some packages having PYTHON_SINGLE_TARGET="" (because they don't have python3 there).

$ equery l python
 * Searching for python ...
[IP-] [  ] dev-lang/python-2.7.14:2.7
[IP-] [  ] dev-lang/python-3.5.4:3.5/3.5m

This issue seems to exist since python was upgraded from 3.4 to 3.5.

Solved...

This somehow sneaked in via auto useflags added to package.use. It wasn't very obvious, tho. Portage should really track and dump the source of useflags set.

I grepped "python_single" on /etc/portage/package.use and et voila, there it was, auto-added by portage probably months ago. I removed the offending lines and now it works.
