I got this out of the config.log for app-crypt/gpgme-1.17.0 .  It also effects net-analyzer/wireshark-3.6.2

What version of dev-qt/qtcore is installed? Have you tried rebuilding it?

Please attach a full build log for at least one failing package.

Also, please provide emerge --info.

Once the requested information has been provided, change the status back to UNCONFIRMED.

The version is 5.15.2-r14.  I will try  re-emerging and see if it makes any difference.

Well, the qt program can now be built, sorry for the noise.
