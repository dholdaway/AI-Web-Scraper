Description

See https://github.com/gentoo/pax-utils/actions/runs/3141695397/jobs/5104428395#step:4:95.

I can't reproduce it locally on Gentoo with 9999 though.

https://github.com/gentoo/pax-utils/commit/a94b2f664714a33eeeb492efe87525fa9947a644 was fine but https://github.com/gentoo/pax-utils/commit/30d1f02c1482ea5371ee4e0a36276ae03b186208 isn't.

I can't seem to reproduce this anymore.
