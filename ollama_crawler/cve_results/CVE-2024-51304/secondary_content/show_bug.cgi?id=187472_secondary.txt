The digest appears to be correct here; 1780 is the correct file size here, too; md5sum here is dcb0d8d6295f536a6a9f11c82ffd6447, which is the md5sum in the manifiest.  My tree is in sync, as far as I can tell...

I synced a few minutes ago, and now the file is 1780 bytes. Who knows what has happened to the tree...

closing.
