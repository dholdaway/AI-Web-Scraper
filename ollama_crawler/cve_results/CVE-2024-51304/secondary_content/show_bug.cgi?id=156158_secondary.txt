I've noticed that the exif information in JPEG files is not read by KDE applications (Kuickshow / konqueror), UNLESS the kdegraphics-kfile-plugins package is installed.

I'd suggest including kdegraphics-kfile-plugins as a dependency (if the exif use flag is set) into at least the packages kuickshow and konqueror.

Any extra information about installed files is gathered via kfile plugins. Don't see that exif data is a special case. Your choice to install them or not.
