Exhibit 99.1     KellanovaFinancial News ReleaseAnalyst Contact:John Renwick, CFA  (269) 961-9050Media Contact:Kris Bahner, (269) 961-3799Kellanova Reports Strong Results in Debut Quarter and Affirms 2024 GuidanceCHICAGO, Ill. - February 8, 2024 - Kellanova (NYSE: K) today announced fourth quarter and full year 2023 results and affirmed its financial outlook for 2024.Highlights:•The Company began the fourth quarter with the transformational spin-off of its North American cereal business, which it executed successfully from a transactional, financial, and operational perspective. •The quarter's results for net sales, operating profit, and earnings per share exceeded the guidance ranges previously provided.•Against a prior-year period recast for the spin-off businesses as discontinued operations, net sales in the fourth quarter increased year on year, reflecting revenue growth management actions and sustained momentum in emerging markets.•Operating profit and earnings per share also increased against the recast prior-year period, as the Company also continued to restore underlying profit margins, with reimbursements covering expenses related to transition services provided to WK Kellogg Co.•The Company affirmed the 2024 guidance provided at its Day@K investor event last August, calling for net sales and operating profit growth rates that align with its long-term targets, and unchanged absolute-dollar guidance for adjusted-basis operating profit, adjusted-basis earnings per share, net cash provided by operating activities, and free cash flow. "To execute the spin-off while delivering solid results amidst challenging industry conditions is a testament to the dedication and focus of our employees," said Steve Cahillane, Kellanova's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We have entered the Kellanova era with a more growth-oriented portfolio, a sharpened strategy, and higher profit margins.  And financially, we have delivered our debut quarter in strong fashion, with financial flexibility and a 2024 plan that is expected to sustain consistent delivery of our newly increased long-term financial algorithm."                             1The following information was filed by Kellogg Co (K) on Thursday, February 8, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.
