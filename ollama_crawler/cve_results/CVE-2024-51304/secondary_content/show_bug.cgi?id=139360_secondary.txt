I had openmotif-2.1.30-r4 installed

I also had xpdf-2.03 installed.

I attempted to upgrade xpdf by emerge xpdf which wanted to install 3.01-r8.  This failed with many errors.

When I upgraded openmotif to latest in portage and tried to upgrade xpdf again, it worked.

Shouldn't the xpdf ebuild have noticed this dependency and pulled it in for me?

Not sure if I'm using severity: blocker; correctly.  I figured that since it blocked me from upgrading xpdf, it was a blocker.  Someone please correct me if I'm wrong in my usage of it, and apologies for the booboo on my part if so.

I'm thinking that emerge --info not necessary here, but if it is, just let me know and I'll include it.

Yeah, so use emerge -uD world and everything will work for you.
