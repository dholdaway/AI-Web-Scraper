The search includes only open bugs by default. 397469 is RESOLVED and thus not in the result set for your query.

https://bugs.gentoo.org/page.cgi?id=quicksearch.html explains the syntax of the quicksearch, and how to use ALL to search for closed bugs as well.

Fair enough but what is your main search for?

Me just coming on to the site for a first time to report a bug (in a very long time)

Thought I had checked to see if I has been doing anything silly. (Which I was a bit and could have fixed it finding the original bug)

Though I had checked for a duplicate bug and therefore follow procedure.

(I do now understand that on here the search is different here:
https://bugs.gentoo.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Gentoo%20Linux&format=guided
however it not clear)

I personally won't be making the same mistake again but how many duplicate bugs are down to this?

(Just a question for discussion I don't know the right answer)

Without using any of the advanced query syntax mentioned in the guide, for quickly finding *open* bugs (i.e. ones that are most likely to affect you right now) matching your query string.
