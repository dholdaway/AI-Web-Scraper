Description


Toralf Förster

The parameter "--quiet" is needed to benefit from KDE's KOnsole feature "Monitor for Silence" and "Monitor for Activity" (which will repaint the KOnsole tab text with a different colour indicating that something happened in that terminal).

Without that parameter --quiet the KOnsole would signal every second a change due to the  " Load avg: 0.22, 0.29, 0.38" information line.

Sadly --quiet suppresses lines like
      USE="custom-cflags* custom-optimization*" 
too which are very useful to indicate why a rebuild is made.

So I'd like to see that --quiet would not suppress those USA flag change information.

FWIW with that USE flags I had to run paxctl not only to the script under /usr/bin, instead to this too :

$> sudo paxctl-ng -perms /usr/lib64/thunderbird/thunderbird

before I got :

tfoerste@t44 ~ $ thunderbird 
Killed

tfoerste@t44 ~ $ strace thunderbird 
execve("/usr/bin/thunderbird", ["thunderbird"], [/* 70 vars */] <unfinished ...>
+++ killed by SIGKILL +++
Killed

tfoerste@t44 ~ $ sudo strace thunderbird 
execve("/usr/bin/thunderbird", ["thunderbird"], [/* 16 vars */] <unfinished ...>
+++ killed by SIGKILL +++

If you use --quiet together with --verbose, then it displays the USE flag change information.

I don't think it's worth spending time on this, since what you want is already possible. Please reopen if you have strong complaints.
