-> I dont know where this file comes from but my guess is that removing it will fix your problem (its fine here with the default settings)

We don't belong here. Please don't add stabilization teams if you don't know what we do.

Removing the file resolves this issue.
On the other hand, it's interesting, because both europecv and mh are pulled in by USE=extra for app-text/texlive.
As I unmerged and reemerged the complete tex tree, it seems reasonable that the same error prevented the emerge in the first time also. Therefore, it seems to be an error in europecv, isn't it?

Thank you for your help
