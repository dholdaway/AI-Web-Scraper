I checked the hsqldb tarball, which hasn't changed between 4.2.5.2 and 4.3.1.2, and the typo isn't there.

OK, this is just bizarre. I did a "grep -r" for "fynally" under the LO build dir and the *only* place that was found was in the build.log. No source code (including the file the build failure complained about) contained that string, and the source code file+line reported as erroneous in the build log has the correct "finally" keyword.

Rerunning the emerge built LO successfully.

I can see a memory error corrupting source code in RAM during compile, but this particular change was so plausible as a simple typo that I didn't look any further.

Closing as WorksForMe since "WTF?" and "Cosmic Rays" aren't options. Apologies for the noise.
