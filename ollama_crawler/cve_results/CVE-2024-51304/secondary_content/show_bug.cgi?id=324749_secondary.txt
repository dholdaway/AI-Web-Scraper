media-sound/audacity-1.3.8 needs automake-1.10, otherwise it won't compile, but doesn't depend on it (as inherited from autotools.eclass, I think). equery shows both 1.10 and 1.11 as dependencies.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. uninstall =sys-devel/automake-1.10*
2. install =media-sound/audacity-1.3.8

Actual Results:  
audacity build fails during emake

Expected Results:  
audacity should have been compiled

http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/qa/autofailure.xml shows the WANT_AUTOMAKE variable being used to depend on a specific version of automake. Maybe this solves the problem?

CC'ing upstream because they may want to fix compatibility with automake 1.11.

Is this bug still relevant? I can't reproduce the problem.

Closing as WORKSFORME because I can't reproduce the failure. Please reopen with more info if you can still reproduce the bug.
