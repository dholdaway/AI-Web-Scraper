I do not get any connections with gtk-gnutella-0.96.4. This was not a problem with 0.96.3. UDP is not blocked at my firewall and port 6346 is properly configured.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start gtk-gnutella.

Yeah, you already told us on Bug 187798. You still didn't tell us how to reproduce the issue though; emerge --info is mandatory as well.

The solution was to delete ~/.gtk-gnutella and restart the application.
