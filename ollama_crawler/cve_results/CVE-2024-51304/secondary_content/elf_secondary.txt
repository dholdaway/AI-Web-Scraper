 Exhibit 99.1e.l.f. Beauty Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal 2024 Results– Delivered Over $1 Billion in Net Sales, up 77% in Fiscal 2024 –  – e.l.f. Cosmetics Gained Market Share for Fifth Consecutive Year –  – Provides Fiscal 2025 Outlook –OAKLAND, California; May 22, 2024 — e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE: ELF) today announced results for the three and twelve months ended March 31, 2024.“Fiscal 2024 marked our strongest year of net sales growth on record, a continuation of the exceptional, consistent, category-leading growth we’ve delivered,” said Tarang Amin, e.l.f. Beauty’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “In Q4, we grew net sales by 71% and expanded our market share by 325 basis points, marking our 21st consecutive quarter of net sales and market share growth. As we look ahead, we believe we are still in the early innings of unlocking the full potential we see for e.l.f. Beauty across cosmetics, skin care and international markets.”Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 ReviewFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023:•Net sales increased 71% to $321.1 million, primarily driven by strength across our retailer and e-commerce channels.•Gross margin increased approximately 180 basis points to 71%, primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange impacts, international price increases, lower costs from retailer activity, cost savings and mix, and improved transportation costs, partially offset by inventory adjustments.•Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased $89.1 million to $210.2 million, or 65% of net sales. Adjusted SG&A (SG&A excluding the items identified in the reconciliation table below) was $196.9 million, or 61% of net sales. The year over year increase in SG&A dollars was primarily due to an increase in marketing and digital spend, compensation and benefits, operations costs, retail fixturing and visual merchandising costs, depreciation and amortization and professional fees.•Net income was $14.5 million on a GAAP basis. Adjusted net income (net income excluding the items identified in the reconciliation table below) was $30.8 million.•Diluted earnings per share were $0.25 on a GAAP basis. Adjusted diluted earnings per share (diluted earnings per share calculated with adjusted net income excluding the items identified in the reconciliation table below) were $0.53.•Adjusted EBITDA (EBITDA excluding the items identified in the reconciliation table below) was $40.9 million, or 13% of net sales, up 93% year over year.Full Year Fiscal 2024 ReviewFor the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the twelve months ended March 31, 2023:•Net sales increased 77% to $1,023.9 million, primarily driven by strength across our retailer and e-commerce channels.                             •Gross margin increased approximately 330 basis points to 71%, primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange impacts, cost savings and mix, improved transportation costs, inventory adjustments, and international price increases, partially offset by costs related to retailer activity.The following information was filed by E.L.F.
