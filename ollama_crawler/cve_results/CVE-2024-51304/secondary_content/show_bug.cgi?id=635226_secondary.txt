Description

Hi,

I tried compiling sci-libs/gdcm-2.8.3 from the imaging overlay. With the overlay
maintainer’s help I can now reproduce the issue for the specific libxslt version, therefore filing the bug report here against the tree package.

I’ll attach build.log and emerge --info here; the files are the same as in the linked github issue.



Reproducible: Always

Test case

This attachment is an example file from gdcm for which xsltproc succeeds with version 1.1.29 but fails for version 1.1.30 with 

runtime error: file file:/usr/share/sgml/docbook/xsl-ns-stylesheets/lib/lib.xsl line 62 element variable
xsltApplySequenceConstructor: A potential infinite template recursion was detected.
You can adjust xsltMaxDepth (--maxdepth) in order to raise the maximum number of nested template calls and variables/params (currently set to 3000).
Templates:
#0 name string.subst 
#1 name string.subst 
...

The command to be run is simply 

   xsltproc gdcmdump.xml

with gdcmdump.xml being the test case file.

The affected packages will need to add a suitable --maxdepth parameter to the xsltproc calls.
