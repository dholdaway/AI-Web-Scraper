 Inside Synopsys Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Expense   Highlight
The decrease in amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized in fiscal 2023, partially offset by amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired during fiscal 2023.



 Financial - Expense   Highlight
The increase in cost of revenue for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily due to increases of $62.2 million in employee-related costs as a result of headcount increases from hiring, $53.5 million in hardware-related costs including inventory provisions, $13.1 million in facility costs, $8.0 million in amortization of technology-related intangible assets, $6.7 million in costs to fulfill IP consulting arrangements, and $6.1 million in the change in fair value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
Design IP Segment The increase in adjusted operating income for both fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to an increase in the revenue of IP products driven by timing of customer demands.

 Other - Other   Highlight
For more on risks related to government export and import restrictions such as the U.S. government's Entity List and other U.S. Export Regulations, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, "Industry Risks - We are subject to governmental export and import requirements that could subject us to liability and restrict our ability to sell our products and services, which could impair our ability to compete in international markets."

 Financial - Income   Highlight
Design Automation Segment The increase in adjusted operating income for both fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to an increase in revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods.
