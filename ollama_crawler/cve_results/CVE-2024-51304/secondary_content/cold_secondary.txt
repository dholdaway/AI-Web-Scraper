Exhibit 99.1AMERICOLD ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2023 RESULTSDelivers Double-Digit AFFO per Share Growth for Full Year 2023Achieves Record Setting Same-Store Economic Occupancy and Fixed Commitments in Full Year 2023Delivers Strong Same-Store Warehouse Services NOI margins in Fourth Quarter 2023Announces Two Inaugural Developments with Canadian Pacific and DP World Strategic PartnershipsAtlanta, GA, February 22, 2024 - Americold Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE: COLD) (the “Company”), a global leader in temperature-controlled logistics, real estate, and value-added services focused on the ownership, operation, acquisition and development of temperature-controlled warehouses, today announced financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.George Chappelle, Chief Executive Officer of Americold Realty Trust, stated, “We are pleased with our fourth quarter results where we delivered AFFO per share of $0.38, an increase of over 31% versus the prior year’s quarter. This performance was driven by our global warehouse same store pool, which generated NOI growth of 7.9%, on a constant currency basis. Our strong same-store pool results were driven by our pricing initiatives, record-setting fixed commit levels, aggressive variable cost management, and improved Warehouse Services efficiencies. In the face of a challenging throughput environment, we continued to accelerate our progress and delivered Warehouse Services margins of 6.1% during the fourth quarter of 2023, which is a 330 basis point improvement versus the third quarter of 2023. Additionally, this quarter, we derived 52.2% of rent and storage revenue from fixed commitment storage contracts, which is another record-setting level for Americold.”“For the full year, we delivered AFFO per share of $1.27, an increase of 14% versus the prior year. When further adjusted for the impact of the cyber event in the second quarter of 2023 and the exit of a large retail customer in our third-party managed business in the fourth quarter 2022, this year over year AFFO per share growth rate would have been 19%.  This performance was primarily driven by our global warehouse same store pool, which generated NOI growth of 12.8%, on a constant currency basis. Additionally, our 2023 full year same store economic occupancy was 84.3%, which is a full year record for Americold, and was almost 400 basis points higher than our previous record, which demonstrates that our infrastructure and value-added services continue to remain in high demand.”“Lastly, we are excited to announce an approximately $130 million greenfield development in Kansas City, Missouri, as part of our collaboration with Canadian Pacific Kansas City, one of North America's largest railroad companies. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we announced our plans through our RSA JV to build a conventional, multi-customer major market distribution center in Dubai at DP World's Port Jebel Ali Free Zone for $35 million. As we move into 2024, we look forward to progressing on these new developments. These partnerships with CPKC and DP World illustrate Americold's unique ability to create value by collaborating with global leaders in adjacent areas of the supply chain.”The following information was filed by Americold Realty Trust (COLD) on Thursday, February 22, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.
