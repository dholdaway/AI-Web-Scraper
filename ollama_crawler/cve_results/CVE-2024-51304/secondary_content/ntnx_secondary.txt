 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets and a partial valuation allowance related to certain foreign net operating losses.



 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
We have recorded a full valuation allowance related to our federal and state net operating losses and other net deferred tax assets and a partial valuation allowance related to certain foreign net operating losses due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the future benefits of those assets.

If we are unable to address these challenges, our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.
