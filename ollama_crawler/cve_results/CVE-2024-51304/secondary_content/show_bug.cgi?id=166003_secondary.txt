On trying to sign a message with evolution 2.8.2.1 You get the following error message: 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Unable to create the message.

Unable to add the SMIMEEncKeyPrefs attribute, you should need to select a different mail options. 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Looking into Edit > Options > Certificates you see that your own certificate has only "Encrypt" activated as possible use, not "sign, encrypt". 

Upgrading to Evolution 2.8.2.1-r1 partly solves the problem - signing at least works now, but my own certificate is still being shown as useful for encrypting only. 

This may be related to the bug described by SuSE Linux here: https://lists.uni-koeln.de/pipermail/sec-info/Week-of-Mon-20041129/004255.html

Reproducible: Always




In my opinion this is quite a serious bug, since evolution is meant to be used in corporate environments, too. Depending on the company digital signing might be essential (e.g. banks, insurance companies and the like). Therefor I set the Severity to major.

How is the cert generated?  I can sign with several certs, so it's not a general problem.  The link is not in english, so it doesn't help me at all.

Only the first part is german - scroll down and you will see the english text. 

The cert has been issued by TC Trustcenter GmbH (GmbH is german style of Ltd.) and I can use it for signing and encrypting email. The english website is here: http://www.trustcenter.de/en/index.htm

For you don't have that problem I will rebuild evolution 2.8.2.1 now (downgrading from 2.8.2.1-r1), to see whether it was only a broken dependency (but i doubt that, since revdep-rebuild didn't say so). I'll post the results asap.

No, sorry, I did a (long scheduled) reinstall of gentoo and can't reproduce the bug now. Must have been some busted link to OpenSSL or something.
