Gcc is a huge package and takes a very long time to compile.

Allow the build process to skip bootstrapping

http://gcc.gnu.org/install/build.html, see "--disable-bootstrap"

Reproducible: Always

Optional behavior suggestion, of course.

Perhaps with a "no-bootstrap" use flag of some sort.

you can already do this in per-package env.  this isn't USE flag worthy.
  EXTRA_ECONF='--disable-bootstrap'

so if that's all you need, i guess there's no work necessary here.
