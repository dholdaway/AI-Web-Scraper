I'm currently following the quick install guide and I am at this step:

gentoo ~ # emerge -vpuD --newuse world

where emerging of busybox-1.6.1 fails

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
run the emerge command above on a fresh installed system
Actual Results:  
busybox fails to emerge

Expected Results:  
busybox should emerge cleanly

See attached files...
