/var/tmp/portage/media-libs/mesa-12.0.1/work/mesa-12.0.1/src/gallium/auxiliary/gallivm/lp_bld_arit.c:3507:7: error: implicit declaration of function ‘lp_build_intrinsic’ [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
       lp_build_intrinsic(builder,
       ^
cc1: some warnings being treated as errors


Since -Werror=implicit-function-declaration is added by the upstream build system, and since nobody reported the issue I guess it happens only on ppc.

It happens only after I switched to gcc-4.9.4

I cannot reproduce (but I do see other issues that I'll work on upstream)
