                        VMSA-2008-0005.1Several critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed in the newest releases of VMware's hosted product line                    VMware Security Advisory  VMware Security AdvisoryAdvisory ID:  VMSA-2008-0005.1 VMware Security AdvisorySynopsis:  Several critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed in the newest releases of VMware's hosted product line VMware Security AdvisoryIssue date:  2008-03-17 VMware Security AdvisoryUpdated on:  2008-04-24 VMware Security AdvisoryCVE numbers:  CVE numbers: CVE-2008-0923 CVE-2008-0923 CVE-2008-1361  CVE-2008-1362 CVE-2007-5269 CVE-2006-2940  CVE-2006-2937 CVE-2006-4343 CVE-2006-4339  CVE-2007-5618 CVE-2008-1364 CVE-2008-1363  CVE-2008-1340                    1. SummarySeveral critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed in the newest releases of VMware's hosted product line.                    2. Relevant releasesVMware Workstation 6.0.2 and earlierVMware Workstation 5.5.4 and earlierVMware Player 2.0.2 and earlierVMware Player 1.0.4 and earlierVMware ACE 2.0.2 and earlierVMware ACE 1.0.2 and earlierVMware Server 1.0.4 and earlierVMware Fusion 1.1.1 and earlier                    3. Problem descriptiona. Host to guest shared folder (HGFS) traversal vulnerabilityOn Windows hosts, if you have configured a VMware host to guest shared folder (HGFS), it is possible for a program running in the guest to gain access to the host's file system and create or modify executable files in sensitive locations. NOTE: VMware Server is not affected because it doesn't use host to guest shared folders. No versions of ESX Server, including ESX Server 3i, are affected by this vulnerability. Because ESX Server is based on a bare-metal hypervisor architecture and not a hosted architecture, and it doesn't include any shared folder abilities. Fusion and Linux based hosted products are unaffected. VMware would like to thank CORE Security Technologies for working with us on this issue. This addresses advisory CORE-2007-0930. The Common Vulnerabilities and exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-0923 to this issue. Hosted products--------------- VMware Workstation 6.0 upgrade to version 6.0.3 (Build# 80004) VMware Workstation 5.5 upgrade to version 5.5.6 (Build# 80404) VMware Player 2.0 upgrade to version 2.0.3 (Build# 80004) VMware Player 1.0 upgrade to version 1.0.6 (Build# 80404) VMware ACE 2.0 upgrade to version 2.0.1 (Build# 80004)VMware ACE 1.0 upgrade to version 1.0.5 (Build# 79846                   b. Insecure named pipesAn internal security audit determined that a malicious Windows user could attain and exploit LocalSystem privileges by causing the authd process to connect to a named pipe that is opened and controlled by the malicious user. The same internal security audit determined that a malicious Windows user could exploit an insecurely created named pipe object to escalate privileges or create a denial of service attack. In this situation, the malicious user could successfully impersonate authd and attain privileges under which Authd is executing. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CVE-2008-1361, CVE-2008-1362 to these issues. Windows Hosted products--------------- VMware Workstation 6.0 upgrade to version 6.0.3 (Build# 80004) VMware Workstation 5.5 upgrade to version 5.5.6 (Build# 80404) VMware Player 2.0 upgrade to version 2.0.3 (Build# 80004) VMware Player 1.0 upgrade to version 1.0.6 (Build# 80404) VMware Server 1.0 upgrade to version 1.0.5 (Build# 80187) VMware ACE 2.0 upgrade to version 2.0.1 (Build# 80004) VMware ACE 1.0 upgrade to version 1.0.5 (Build# 79846)                   c. Updated libpng library to version 1.2.22 to address various security vulnerabilitiesSeveral flaws were discovered in the way libpng handled various PNG image chunks. An attacker could create a carefully crafted PNG image file in such a way that it could cause an application linked with libpng to crash when the file was manipulated. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2007-5269 to this issue. Hosted products--------------- VMware Workstation 6.0 upgrade to version 6.0.3 (Build# 80004) VMware Workstation 5.5 upgrade to version 5.5.6 (Build# 80404) VMware Player 2.0 upgrade to version 2.0.3 (Build# 80004) VMware Player 1.0 upgrade to version 1.0.6 (Build# 80404) VMware Server 1.0 upgrade to version 1.0.5 (Build# 80187) VMware ACE 2.0 upgrade to version 2.0.1 (Build# 80004) VMware ACE 1.0 upgrade to version 1.0.5 (Build# 79846) NOTE: Fusion is not affected by this issue.                   d. Updated OpenSSL library to address various security vulnerabilitiesUpdated OpenSSL fixes several security flaws were discovered in previous versions of OpenSSL. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the following names to these issues: CVE-2006-2940, CVE-2006-2937, CVE-2006-4343, CVE-2006-4339. Hosted products--------------- VMware Workstation 6.0 upgrade to version 6.0.3 (Build# 80004) VMware Workstation 5.5 upgrade to version 5.5.6 (Build# 80404) VMware Player 2.0 upgrade to version 2.0.3 (Build# 80004) VMware Player 1.0 upgrade to version 1.0.6 (Build# 80404) VMware Server 1.0 upgrade to version 1.0.5 (Build# 80187) VMware ACE 2.0 upgrade to version 2.0.1 (Build# 80004) VMware ACE 1.0 upgrade to version 1.0.5 (Build# 79846) NOTE: Fusion is not affected by this issue.                   e. VIX API default setting changed to a more secure default valueWorkstation 6.0.2 allowed anonymous console access to the guest by means of the VIX API. This release, Workstation 6.0.3, disables this feature. This means that the Eclipse Integrated Virtual Debugger and the Visual Studio Integrated Virtual Debugger will now prompt for user account credentials to access a guest. Hosted products--------------- VMware Workstation 6.0 upgrade to version 6.0.3 (Build# 80004) VMware Player 2.0 upgrade to version 2.0.3 (Build# 80004) VMware ACE 2.0 upgrade to version 2.0.1 (Build# 80004)                   f. Windows 2000 based hosted products privilege escalation vulnerabilityThis release addresses a potential privilege escalation on Windows 2000 hosted products. Certain services may be improperly registered and present a security vulnerability to Windows 2000 machines. VMware would like to thank Ray Hicken for reporting this issue and David Maciejak for originally pointing out these types of vulnerabilities. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2007-5618 to this issue. Windows versions of Hosted products--------------- VMware Workstation 6.0 upgrade to version 6.0.3 (Build# 80004) VMware Workstation 5.5 upgrade to version 5.5.6 (Build# 80404) VMware Player 2.0 upgrade to version 2.0.3 (Build# 80004) VMware Player 1.0 upgrade to version 1.0.6 (Build# 80404) VMware Server 1.0 upgrade to version 1.0.5 (Build# 80187) VMware ACE 2.0 upgrade to version 2.0.1 (Build# 80004) VMware ACE 1.0 upgrade to version 1.0.5 (Build# 79846) NOTE: Fusion and Linux based products are not affected by this issue.                   g. DHCP denial of service vulnerabilityA potential denial of service issue affects DHCP service running on the host. VMware would like to thank Martin O'Neal for reporting this issue. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-1364 to this issue. Hosted products--------------- VMware Workstation 5.5 upgrade to version 5.5.6 (Build# 80404) VMware Player 1.0 upgrade to version 1.0.6 (Build# 80404) VMware Server 1.0 upgrade to version 1.0.5 (Build# 80187) VMware ACE 1.0 upgrade to version 1.0.5 (Build# 79846) VMware Fusion 1.1 upgrade to version 1.1.1 (Build# 72241) NOTE: This issue doesn't affect the latest versions of VMwareWorkstation 6, VMware Player 2, and ACE 2 products.                   h. Local Privilege Escalation on Windows based platforms by Hijacking VMware VMX configuration fileVMware uses a configuration file named "config.ini" which is located in the application data directory of all users. By manipulating this file, a user could gain elevated privileges by hijacking the VMware VMX process. VMware would like to thank Sun Bing for reporting the issue. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-1363 to this issue. Windows based Hosted products--------------- VMware Workstation 6.0 upgrade to version 6.0.3 (Build# 80004) VMware Workstation 5.5 upgrade to version 5.5.6 (Build# 80404) VMware Player 2.0 upgrade to version 2.0.3 (Build# 80004) VMware Player 1.0 upgrade to version 1.0.6 (Build# 80404) VMware Server 1.0 upgrade to version 1.0.5 (Build# 80187) VMware ACE 2.0 upgrade to version 2.0.1 (Build# 80004) VMware ACE 1.0 upgrade to version 1.0.5 (Build# 79846)                   i. Virtual Machine Communication Interface (VMCI) memory corruption resulting in denial of serviceVMCI was introduced in VMware Workstation 6.0, VMware Player 2.0, and VMware ACE 2.0. It is an experimental, optional feature and it may be possible to crash the host system by making specially crafted calls to the VMCI interface. This may result in denial of service via memory exhaustion and memory corruption. VMware would like to thank Andrew Honig of the Department of Defense for reporting this issue. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-1340 to this issue.
