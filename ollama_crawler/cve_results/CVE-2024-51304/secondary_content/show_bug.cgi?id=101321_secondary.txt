With the new lvm, when I try to do a vgchange -a y, or at boot, I've got the following message :
  Couldn't find device with uuid 'vJSbcb-3n0C-BkJ0-2106-iqWF-8pBR-HlJa18'.
  Couldn't find all physical volumes for volume group vg.
  Unable to find volume group "vg"

The other pv of my volume group is deteted ok.

I'm sure the problem doesn't comes from my hardrive, because I can mount the volume group when I 
boot from the livecd

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:

Actual Results:  
LVM doesn't see one of my pv

Expected Results:  
volume group activated

pvdispaly :
  Couldn't find device with uuid 'vJSbcb-3n0C-BkJ0-2106-iqWF-8pBR-HlJa18'.

(In reply to comment #0)

In fact it was apparently a new filter which was preventing my udev volume from being scanned by lvm. 
But I can't see this filter anywher.

Anyway.....
