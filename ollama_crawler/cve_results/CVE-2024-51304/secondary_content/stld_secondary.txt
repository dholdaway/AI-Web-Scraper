Annual 2023 Performance Highlights:
 

§Record
                                            steel shipments of 12.8 million tons

§Net
                                            sales of $18.8 billion, operating income of $3.2 billion, and net income of $2.5 billion

§Adjusted
                                            EBITDA of $3.7 billion and strong cash flow from operations of $3.5 billion

§Strong
                                            liquidity of $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2023

§Share
                                            repurchases of $1.5 billion of the company’s common stock, representing 8 percent of
                                            its outstanding shares

§Strong
                                            after-tax return-on-invested-capital of 32 percent for the three-year period ended December 31,
                                            2023
 
Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ/GS: STLD) today announced fourth
quarter and annual 2023 financial results. The company reported fourth quarter 2023 net sales of $4.2 billion and net income of $424
million, or $2.61 per diluted share. Comparatively, the company’s sequential third quarter 2023 net income was $577 million, or
$3.47 per diluted share, and prior year fourth quarter net income was $635 million, or $3.61 per diluted share.
 
“The teams executed well and delivered
a solid operational and financial performance across our operating platforms during 2023, resulting in our second highest annual net
sales of $18.8 billion, as well as, annual operating income of $3.2 billion, and adjusted EBITDA of $3.7 billion,” said Mark D.
Millett, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “The strength of our cash generation was once again demonstrated with annual cash
flow from operations of $3.5 billion. We maintained strong liquidity of $3.5 billion,
while at the same time meaningfully growing our business through significant organic growth investments, coupled with strong shareholder
distributions through a positive dividend growth profile and meaningful share repurchases. We have a firm foundation for our continued
long-term growth and ongoing value creation strategy.
 
“Underlying domestic steel demand was firm throughout 2023 supported
by the construction, automotive, industrial, and energy sectors,” continued Millett. “Customer steel inventories also remained
below historical averages, in combination resulting in generally steady order patterns. Our steel operations achieved record 2023 annual
shipments of 12.8 million tons and historically strong operating income of $1.9 billion. Our steel fabrication business achieved its
second highest annual earnings with operating income of $1.6 billion. Despite a challenging pricing environment throughout much of the
year, our metals recycling teams meaningfully increased volume and achieved operating income of $108 million. The strength of our diversified,
value-added circular manufacturing model was certainly evidenced in 2023.”
 
Fourth Quarter 2023 Comments
 
Fourth quarter 2023 operating income for the company’s steel
operations was $365 million, representing a 24 percent sequential decline, based on seasonally lower long product steel shipments and
flat rolled steel metal spread compression, as average realized flat rolled steel selling values declined more than scrap costs. The
fourth quarter 2023 average external product selling price for the company’s steel operations decreased $101 per ton sequentially
to $1,090 per ton. The average ferrous scrap cost per ton melted at the company’s steel mills decreased $12 per ton sequentially
to $393 per ton.
 
Fourth quarter 2023 operating income from the
company’s metals recycling operations decreased to $6 million, due to seasonally lower shipments and lower nonferrous scrap realized
selling values.
