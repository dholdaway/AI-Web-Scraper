The new bugzilla theme / engine has one small issue that is "nagging" me. The comment blocks seem to have a fixed width, which means in my 1680x1050 screen they only fill half of the screen width. On some bugs that affects the "readability" of the comments. For example look at bug 357927.
Is there any way to let the comment blocks to fill the available screen width?

Bugzilla breaks comments by default to a certain length. Additionally, the comment box width is set to 50em which will cause further 'virtual' breaks.

As this breaking behavior has afaik existed for quite a long time (and was also that way in our old bugzilla), I don't think we can fix that with any easy theme changes (unless there is a magic setting already implemented that I'm not aware of).

further, we've had many more bugs about people complaining about comments being unwrapped rather than wrapped.  so if there is no way of pushing this out to the user settings, i think the current site behavior caters to more people than the other way around.

My god this
makes
comments really
hard
to read.

In chromium, I can widen the textbox, but bugzilla apparently still line wraps in bad places.

http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/tip/en/html/hintsandtips.html says that bugzilla only line wraps at display time. But bugzilla puts comments in <pre> tags, so it looks like the enclosing box is isn't sized to take into account the margin around the text, and thus causes the one-word-on-a-line fuck-up.

http://fixunix.com/mozilla/411436-line-wrapping-bugzilla.html says that there is a variable called COMMENT_COLS in Bugzilla/Constants.pm that allows you to modify the width of the comment boxes. Maybe this is the solution?

I don't see this problem happening anymore.

Maybe we can close this?

screenshot of bugzilla screen

On my 1920x1080 laptop screen, the bugzilla comments fill a little over 1/3 of the screen width. Has anything been changed on the bugzilla config?
I understand it might not be possible to giver users a choice about this and in such case I'll just "shut up".
Is / was anything else expected from me on this bug?

I guess this can be closed.
