“2023 was an extraordinary year for MicroStrategy as we strategically raised capital to significantly increase our bitcoin holdings, and continued to innovate, including by developing and launching MicroStrategy AI, our first to market AI-based BI tool. We achieved double-digit subscription services revenue growth for both the fourth quarter and full year, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to transition our business to the cloud. We believe that the combination of our operating structure, bitcoin strategy, and focus on technology innovation provides a unique opportunity for value creation for our shareholders,” said Phong Le, President and Chief Executive Officer, MicroStrategy.

 Inside Microstrategy Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
If the market value of bitcoin declines or we are unable to regain profitability in future periods, we may be required to increase the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, which could result in a charge that would materially adversely affect net income (loss) in the period in which the charge is incurred.



 Other - Other   Highlight
However, we consider the risk of significant volatility in our established SSP to be small given our historical transaction experience and internal processes to monitor SSP ranges on an ongoing basis and work with management in the event a trend that could impact the future ranges is detected.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
It shows the increase (decrease) in material international revenues or expenses, as applicable, from the same period in the prior year, based on comparisons to the prior year quarterly average foreign currency exchange rates.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Critical accounting estimates involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and are estimates that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
Included in cost of consulting revenues for 2023 is an aggregate $0.7 million unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact.
