 Inside Service Properties Trust's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Expense   Highlight
An economic recession or continued or intensified disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our financial condition, operations at our hotels, our tenants and their ability or willingness to renew our leases or pay rent to us, may restrict our ability to obtain new or replacement financing, would likely increase our cost of capital, and may cause the values of our properties to decline.



 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
These indicators may include weak or declining operating profitability, cash flows or liquidity, our decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life or market or industry changes that could permanently reduce the value of our investments.

 Other - Other   Highlight
We mitigate these risks by procuring, or requiring our managers or tenants to procure, insurance coverage we believe adequate to protect us from material damages and losses resulting from the consequences of losses caused by climate change.

 Other - Other   Highlight
However, we cannot be sure that our mitigation efforts will be sufficient or that future storms, rising sea levels or other changes that may occur due to future climate change could not have a material adverse effect on our financial results.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
The Income Taxes Topic also prescribes how we should recognize, measure and present in our financial statements uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in a tax return.
