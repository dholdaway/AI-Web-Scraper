Many use our LiveUSB image to install and repair systems.
Typing all the mount commands over and over is annoying. 
I suggest to add a script similar to this one:
https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/User:Genr8/ChrootMountCommands

I was told there is also sys-apps/arch-chroot
I have never used this one.

Reproducible: Always

The handbook mentions `arch-chroot`. It should be on the LiveUSB too. Does it work for you?
