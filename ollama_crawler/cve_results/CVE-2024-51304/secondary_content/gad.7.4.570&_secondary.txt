To determine whether Oct-2 is required for B-cell development or function, or has other developmental roles, the gene was disrupted by homologous recombination. Oct-2-l- mice develop normally but die within hours of birth for undetermined reasons. Mutants contain normal numbers of B-cell precursors but are somewhat deficient in IgM+ B cells. These B cells have a marked defect in their capacity to secrete immunoglobulin upon mitogenic stimulation in vitro. Thus, Oct-2 is not required for the generation of immunoglobulin-bearing B cells but is crucial for their maturation to immunoglobulin-secreting cells and for another undetermined organismal function.genesdev.cshlp.orgShow moreShow lessSave Cite Cited by 320 Related articles All 13 versions  PrivacyTermsHelpAbout ScholarSearch help
