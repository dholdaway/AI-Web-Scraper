Description

I run 'nv' (not nvidia) driver with QuadroFX 1000 card, digital SGI FX180 monitor.
xorg-x11-6.8.2-r1,  amd64 dual opteron on Tyan 2885 board, gentoo-dev-sources-2.6.9-r14, devfs system

Switching to virtual console from X with Alt-Cntrl-F1-6 does not work. On the press, mouse is killed, there is a momentary blink, image retains the same as under X. Interestingly, pressing Return at this stage shifts the image leftwise (nad circularily) by about 20%. So by pressing return I can move the image of my session in circle. With that, the bottom 20-30 pixel rows get corrupted.
Other keys does not seem to produce anything in this state.

Pressing Alt-Cntrl-F7 restores the X session all right. Mouse is back, X dumps new Xorg.log, everything is dandy and working.

As two remarks:
1. Console works all right at boot time
2. I continously have, perhaps related, 
 localhost kernel: devfs_mk_dev: could not append to parent for vcc/7

messages in the log, although vcc/* devices are there as well as the symplinks
for /dev/tty* -> /dev/vcc/*

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start X session
2. Press Alt-Cntrl-F1
3.

Actual Results:  
Screen blinks and returns to X-window image, mouse is killed, some keyboard
keys, like Return produce image motions, others do nothing.
Alt-Cntrl-F7 restores the X-window session

Expected Results:  
Switch to the first virtual console

Does it work with another X driver, e.g. fbdev (if you have framebuffer set up) or vesa?

Hm, upgrading to 2005.0 profile seems resolved the issue.

Perhaps the issue was with CONSOLEFONT in /etc/rc.conf, which I tried to
change for another than the default option before. 

The only other obvious thing to happen during upgrade is glibc recompilation.
