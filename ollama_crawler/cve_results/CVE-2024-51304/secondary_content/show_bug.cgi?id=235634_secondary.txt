Description

Using the example xsend.py I get the following error:

connected with tls
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./xsend.py", line 32, in <module>
    auth=cl.auth(jid.getNode(),jidparams['password'],resource=jid.getResource())
  File "/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/xmpp/client.py", line 225, in auth
    while self.SASL.startsasl=='in-process' and self.Process(1): pass
  File "/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/xmpp/dispatcher.py", line 303, in dispatch
    handler['func'](session,stanza)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/xmpp/auth.py", line 177, in SASLHandler
    key,value=pair.split('=', 1)
ValueError: need more than 1 value to unpack

I haven't debugged it further but it seems similar to URI and latest auth.py from upstream CVS fixes the problem here.

please provide a diff between auth.py from 0.4.1 and CVS. Thanks!

there's no new version since 2007-12-15 and I guess, there might be some incompatible changes in CVS since then.
