I removed kdebase-pam because it's not considered a split package anymore,
and the ebuilds in portage (both kdm-3.4.0_beta1 and beta2) are aware of this.

But it seems the one you have in /var/db it's not... what to do?

Nothing. Portage is smart enough to grab the files does it's cleaning job after presenting the error message. I just wanted to make everyone wild err... aware about it. ;) At best something like this shouldn't happen with stable packages, though.

We could have kept it in the derivation map with no ill effects. We can do
that for stable packages if needed.
