Build log for python2.5

The package supposedly supports py2.5 but it has a single test failure when using it:

======================================================================
FAIL: test_basic_api.test_lexer_classes(<class 'pygments.lexers.parsers.AntlrObjectiveCLexer'>,)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.5/site-packages/nose/case.py", line 197, in runTest
    self.test(*self.arg)
  File "/tmp/portage/dev-python/pygments-1.5-r1/work/Pygments-1.5-python2_5/lib/tests/test_basic_api.py", line 70, in verify
    assert isinstance(token[1], unicode)
AssertionError: AssertionError:
-------------------- >> begin captured stdout << ---------------------

I can't reproduce it. Maybe I broke something at the time, or it is just a random race condition.
