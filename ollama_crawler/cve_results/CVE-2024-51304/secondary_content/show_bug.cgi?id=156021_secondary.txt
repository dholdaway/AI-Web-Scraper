Please, report this upstream, we can't fix binary-only stuff.

Upstream is opera.com

You can also try to ask in http://my.opera.com/community/forums/

Good luck!

Not enough information: which URLs reproduce this behaviour, which plugins are installed, which plugin is used to display the URL according to your Plugins configuration in Opera, which plugin is it that segfaults?

Usually a revdep-rebuild (emerge gentoolkit first) repairs the libraries that produce these segfaults. I suggest the reporter look there first.

FWIW, I can view stuff on video.google.com just fine, on several different machines using different versions of Opera (both 9.02, older as well as newer versions). Therefore, I am closing this bug as WORKSFORME.
