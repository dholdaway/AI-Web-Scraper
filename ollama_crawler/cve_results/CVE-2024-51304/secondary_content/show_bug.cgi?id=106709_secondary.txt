In few words, www.gentoo.org does not get the current userinfo.xml from the CVS
tree, that is, it is not being parsed periodically. This behaviour has been
observed since 3 months ago. Could someone check why

http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/roll-call/userinfo.xml

does not contain the updated information of

/proj/en/devrel/roll-call/userinfo.xml

???

Thanks a lot for your time :)

20:34 < Deathwing00> /proj/en/devrel/roll-call/userinfo.xml <--- How is it it
isn't updated in the web interface??
20:39 <@vapier> think you could be a *little* more specific ?
20:44 < Deathwing00> vapier:
http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/roll-call/userinfo.xml <-- does not show
the information of
                     /proj/en/devrel/roll-call/userinfo.xml in the tree
20:44 < Deathwing00> that is, the userinfo.xml file shown in www.g.o does not
match the updated userinfo
20:44 < Deathwing00> devaway does work fine though
20:45 < Deathwing00> I'm tired so excuse me if I do not explain myself
20:45 < Deathwing00> let me try again
20:45 < Deathwing00> the file under the proj/ tree is updated correctly
20:45 <@vapier> no, i understand what you mean now, i just dont have an answer
for you
20:45 < Deathwing00> ah
20:46 < Deathwing00> shall I poke infra?
20:46 <@vapier> yar
20:46 < Deathwing00> ack, tyvm
20:46 < Deathwing00> bugzilla
20:46 <@vapier> or just ping like ramerath in #-dev
20:46 <@vapier> or #gentoo-infra
20:46 <@kingtaco|work> the update is done in batch mode
20:47 < Deathwing00> kingtaco|work: the file isn't updated for over 3 months now
20:47 <@kingtaco|work> it takes up to 1 hour to sync to the web farm
20:47 <@kingtaco|work> are you trying to get the raw xml?
20:47 < Deathwing00> devaway does get updated every hour, however userinfo does not
20:48 < Deathwing00> kingtaco|work:
http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/roll-call/userinfo.xml
20:48 < Deathwing00> have a look
20:48 < Deathwing00> that file wasn't updated since jun 2005
20:48 < Deathwing00> however the file in the tree has a totally different content
20:49 <@kingtaco|work> yes, I think it is parsed
20:49 < kallamej> actually, kloeri did some updates yesterday...
20:49 < Deathwing00> ioannis@blackhat ~/CVS/proj/en/devrel/roll-call $ cat
userinfo.xml | grep deathwing00
20:49 < Deathwing00>   <user username="deathwing00">
20:49 < Deathwing00>       <email role="gentoo">deathwing00@gentoo.org</email>
20:49 < Deathwing00> I see myself not
20:49 <@kingtaco|work> Deathwing00, yeah, bug infra
