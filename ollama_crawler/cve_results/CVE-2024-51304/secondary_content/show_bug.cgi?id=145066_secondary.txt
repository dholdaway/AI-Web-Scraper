Description

The way that Gentoo install clamav, it's use freshclam to get antivirus database refresh.

but, it's _required_ that you specify the refresh rate; otherwise, no updates at all !!!

From man pages  :
-d, --daemon
              Run in a daemon mode. This option requires --checks.


-c #n, --checks=#n
              Check #n times per day for a new database. #n must be between 1 and 50.

That's what /etc/freshclam.conf is for.

By defaults: 

# Number of database checks per day.
# Default: 12 (every two hours)
#Checks 24


is commented, maybe uncomment and add 1 ?

oh, forget to say, I've servers where freshclam (0.88.3) doesnt update, until I force -n 2 at startup or force a config option.

As written in the comment, the default value is 2 hours. It works perfectly fine here.

Also, your clamav is outdated.
