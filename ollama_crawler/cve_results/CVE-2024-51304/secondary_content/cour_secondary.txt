 Inside Coursera, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
Our business and financial conditions have been, and may continue to be, impacted by adverse macroeconomic factors, including inflation, higher interest rates, and volatility in foreign currency rates.



 Other - Other   Highlight
These estimates are continually evaluated until such time as the uncertainties are resolved, generally at the time the final term enrollment report is provided by the university partner.

 Other - Other   Highlight
The mix of our business amongst our Consumer, Enterprise, and Degrees segments shifts from time to time, and these shifts have and will continue to affect our financial performance.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
The primary drivers for the increase were revenue growth combined with higher content costs as a percentage of revenue that resulted in an increase of $105.4 million in costs related to educator partner fees, as explained in more detail below.

 Other - Other   Highlight
To the extent there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our financial position and results of operations will be affected.
