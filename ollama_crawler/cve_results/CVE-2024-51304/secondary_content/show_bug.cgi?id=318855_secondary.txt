-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is happening to me with 0.10.12 and 0.10.13.
I bumped libmpeg2 myself up to 0.5.1 from 0.4.1 and now it compiles fine. Please add the version check to the ebuild.

Best regards

Reproducible: Always

0.10.13 and 0.10.16 compile fine against libmpeg2-0.4.1 for me... hopefully a temporary glitch on your system (not having proper include paths, it seems, as it didn't find mpeg2.h), or fixed since 0.10.13
