Now that banshee-0.10.5 is out with experimental gstreamer-0.10 support, it may be time to think about a USE flag to allow testing applications like this with gstreamer-0.10, so when this new release of banshee hits portage we can start giving the new gstreamer a workout.

FYI, Break My Gentoo has been using gstreamer10 in some packages to allow said support.

Already in portage, emerge sync...

I see that it is in portage now. Is there a way of enabling gstreamer-0.10 support? That was really the point of this bug report, not just that it was out since I knew it would be in portage within a couple of days.
