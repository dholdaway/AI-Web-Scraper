The LiveGUI installation ISO doesn't take me directly into kde on some machines. On some machines, it just takes me into a shell prompt, very similar to the minimal installer. On my laptop, it takes me right into KDE. On the machines that don't take me into kde, I tried to run startx and got the following result:


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create live install media using this command: 
```
dd if=./livegui-amd64-20230711T174853Z.iso of=/dev/sdc bs=8192k; sync
```
2. boot from that usb in uefi mode from bios
Actual Results:  
I get logged into a shell. When I try to run startx, I get errors (attached).

Expected Results:  
I expect kde to run when the session begins.

Restarting the display manager with the following gets kde to start:
```
sudo rc-service restart display-manager restart
```

Plain startx will use the system default xinitrc which calls xterm & twm, which are not installed.

Can you try this for a low-level X test?
XSESSION=fluxbox startx

I'm unable to reproduce the issue anymore. I'm assuming it was fixed
