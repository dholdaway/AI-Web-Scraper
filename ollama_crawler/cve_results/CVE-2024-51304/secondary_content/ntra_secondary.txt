 Inside Natera, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
In September 2015, we entered into a Credit Line with UBS, or the Credit Line, providing for a $50.0 million revolving line of credit which could be drawn in increments at any time.



 Financial - Expense   Highlight
This was offset by a $9.1 million decrease in marketing costs and a $3.2 million net decrease in travel, facilities, office and other costs.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in revenue from our collaborative agreements.

 Other - Other   Highlight
For the year ended December 31, 2023, we had a net loss of $434.8 million, and we expect to continue to incur losses in future periods as we continue to devote a substantial portion of our resources to our research and development and commercialization efforts for our existing and new products.
