http://gentoo.mirrors.tera-byte.com / rsync://mirrors.tera-byte.com/gentoo-portage/ (aka rsync1.ca.gentoo.org) appears to be down.

It had some issues a month or so ago as well, but it came back up before I could report it.

Does anyone have contact information for them?  Might want to pop them a message.  Rsync status page says they've been down for 8+ hours.  Thanks


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. use tera-byte as a mirror
2. try to sync or fetch packages

Actual Results:  
DNS resolves but times out.


Expected Results:  
Server online and serving requests.

tera-byte seems to be back online, I'll close this for now.
