While trying to install the beta version of kdebluetooth (net-wireless/kdebluetooth-1.0_beta2-r2) it wants to downgrade Qt ([ebuild     UD] x11-libs/qt-3.3.4-r8 [3.3.6-r4])

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. add 'net-wireless/kdebluetooth ~x88' to /etc/portage/package.keywords
2. emerge -pvtu kdebluetooth
3.

Actual Results:  
Downgrade of Qt libraries

Expected Results:  
No downgrade of the Qt libraries

It doesn't depend on a specific Qt 3 version. Either a different or more likely a local problem.

No real info here; plus as said above, it doesn't specify any qt version at all.
