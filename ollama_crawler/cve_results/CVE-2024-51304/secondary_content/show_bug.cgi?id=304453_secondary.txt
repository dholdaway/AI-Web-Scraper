KeepNote is a nice note taking application which supports pasting images into the notes and other neat stuff

description from the site:
"With KeepNote, you can store your class notes, TODO lists, research notes, journal entries, paper outlines, etc in a simple notebook hierarchy with rich-text formatting, images, and more. Using full-text search, you can retrieve any note for later reference."

Reproducible: Always
