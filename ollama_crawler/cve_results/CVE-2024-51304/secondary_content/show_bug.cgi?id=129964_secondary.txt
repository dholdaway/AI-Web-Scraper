This bug happens when kdesvn is installed (I suppouse it couse conflict between kde-base/kdesdk-kioslaves and kdesvn daemon)
1. checkout your Kdevelop project from SVN to new dir
2. try to open your project in KDevelop - it will hang.
3. emerge -C kdesdk
4. repeat step 2. result is OK.

step 3. emerge -C kdesvn of course, not kdesdk

Does this problem still occur for you with current versions? If so, please add your "emerge --info".
