Description

If I do
eselect bashcomp enable --global shadow
the result is a symbolic link
/etc/bash_completion.d/shadow -> //etc/shadow
where it should be
/etc/bash_completion.d/shadow -> /usr/share/bash-completion/shadow
(and the two slashes are not a typo, maybe the give a hint at what's going on?)

I know this is pretty little to work on and I'm ready to supply any further information necessary. It is annoying me enough to take a closer look at it, so I would appreciate some advice on how to find the cause of this.

Hmm.... With app-admin/eselect-1.2.10 it works just fine here.

# eselect bashcomp enable --global shadow
# readlink /etc/bash_completion.d/shadow 
/usr/share/bash-completion/shadow

I'm a bit confused. The problem just vanished after existing for several weeks. I'm quite sure I didn't change anything important (only remerging texlive) in between, whereas I remerged (emerge -ue world) the whole system some days ago and the problem persisted.

I'm sorry for the stir, but I really thought this could be tracked down.
