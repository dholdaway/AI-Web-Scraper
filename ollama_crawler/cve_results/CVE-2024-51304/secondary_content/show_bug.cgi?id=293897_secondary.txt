dev-java/xerces-2.9.1 is not including the xerces-tools part of the installation. xml-apis in the that, perhaps there is another ebuild I am not familar with that includes it, but I have yet to find it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge xerces
2. No xml-api.jar 


Expected Results:  
Emerging xerces would include xml-api.jar

The package is called xml-commons-external and xerces depends on it.
