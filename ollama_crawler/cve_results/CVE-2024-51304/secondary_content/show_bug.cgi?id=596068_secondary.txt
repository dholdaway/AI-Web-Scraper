Description

This is from #gentoo-alt discussion with trinque.

Each time I need to bootstrap on a new machine I'll need to
1. Search for "gentoo prefix bootstrap".
2. Choose between "Bootstrap" and "Manual Bootstrap" page.
3. Find the link to `bootstrap-prefix.sh` in a large chunk of text.
4. Pay extra care not to download the `bootstrap-bash.sh`, since it appear above `bootstrap-prefix.sh` on the page.

There are many issues in the process:
1. We have two names for this project: Gentoo Prefix and Gentoo/Alt. If we consider Gentoo Prefix/libc and Gentoo RAP then we have 4 names for roughly the same thing. We should have a single name for the whole project, and a single name for the libc/RAP variant.
2. Should "Manual Bootstrap" be in a separate page? AFAIK the manual bootstrap process is largely obsolete, and having that page will likely confuse new comers. We should have a Warning instead of Note at the top of the page.
3. The link to `bootstrap-prefix.sh` should be in a CODE block so people can easily find it.
4. The instruction to bootstrap bash (and the link to bootstrap-bash.sh) should be at the bottom of the page, in a Appendix section or something else.
5. No checksum for the downloaded bootstrap script.
6. A newly registered account cannot edit the pages to make improvement.

Yeah, this is all reasonable.  The checksum is kind of interesting, but I guess signing makes that better.

the script can be retrieved from https gitweb nowadays

bootstrap-prefix.sh is the only presented option
