Since google changed back their token page the following patches breaks gmail auth so it's impossible to add gmail account into kmail or google calendar into kontact.

libkgapi-17.04.0-auth1.patch 
libkgapi-17.04.0-auth2.patch
libkgapi-17.04.0-auth3.patch

Checking back with upstream. Google, this is getting tiresome...

Upstream says no. What makes you think that Google have revised their changes?
