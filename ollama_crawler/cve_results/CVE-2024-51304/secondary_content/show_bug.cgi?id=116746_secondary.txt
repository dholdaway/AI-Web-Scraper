On my system, when I emerge gxmame, no iterface icons are installed. So, when starting gxmame, it prints lots of errors to terminal (about icons not found) and most of the buttons have a "not found" icon.

How to reproduce? "emerge gxmame"

See more info at following attached files.

On more thing: when I run "strace" on gxmame, I can see lines like these:
open("/usr/share/pixmaps/emblem-favorite.png", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/usr/share/pixmaps/gxmame-emblem-favorite.png", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory

needs stock icons to run correctly.  merge x11-themes/gnome-icon-theme or resync/remerge for the fix.

Ok, re-emerged it. There are still some missing icons:

** (gxmame:22994): WARNING **: Couldn't find themed icon for "gxmame-mouse"
** (gxmame:22994): WARNING **: Couldn't find themed icon for "gxmame-keyboard"
** (gxmame:22994): WARNING **: Couldn't find themed icon for "gxmame-rom"
** (gxmame:22994): WARNING **: Couldn't find themed icon for "gxmame-emblem-favorite"
** (gxmame:22994): WARNING **: Couldn't find themed icon for "gxmame-emblem-played"
** (gxmame:22994): WARNING **: Couldn't find themed icon for "gxmame-emblem-available"
** (gxmame:22994): WARNING **: Couldn't find themed icon for "gxmame-emblem-unavailable"
** (gxmame:22994): WARNING **: Couldn't find themed icon for "gxmame-emblem-sound"
** (gxmame:22994): WARNING **: Couldn't find themed icon for "gxmame-emblem-not-working"

To see one of these missing icons, go to Option->Default Options->Controllers, and look at bottom half of dialog.

I guess (have not time to investigate it yet) all of these icons should be available at source package. At least I hope so.

You probably need to run /usr/bin/gtk-update-icon-cache

No, the problem persists. Exact same message from comment #6.

Emerging gxmame emerged also hicolor-icon-theme-0.8 and gnome-icon-theme-2.10.1 as dependencies.

This is a configuration problem on your end.  Sorry, I can't reproduce it.

Tried re-emerging it now, and again the same error of comment #6. Then, I created the strace log attached above.

I'm sorry you can't reproduce it. Could you please run "locate gxmame-keyboard", then run "equery belongs" on file you found? Here, that command finds no file.

yeah, I don't have one either.
