As previously foreshadowed in Cliffs' 2022 10-K, full-year results included a goodwill impairment charge totaling $125 million, related to the Tooling & Stamping business within the Other Businesses segment, primarily driven by revised investment plans and higher discount rates.

This compares to 2022 net income of $1.4 billion, or $2.55 per diluted share, with adjusted net income2 of $1.4 billion or $2.74 per diluted share. For the full year 2023, Adjusted EBITDA1 was $1.9 billion, compared to $3.2 billion in 2022. The reduction was primarily driven by lower steel index pricing in 2023 compared to 2022, partially offset by higher sales volumes and lower operating costs.In 2023, the Company recorded cash flows from operations of $2.3 billion and had capital expenditures of $646 million, equating to free cash flow of $1.6 billion3. During 2023, the Company reduced its net debt3 by $1.3 billion, using the majority of its free cash flow for this purpose.
