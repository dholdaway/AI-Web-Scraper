Exhibit 99.1NEWS RELEASE1901 Chouteau Avenue: St. Louis, MO 63103: Ameren.com ContactsMediaInvestorsTony ParainoAndrew Kirk314.554.2182314.554.3942aparaino@ameren.comakirk@ameren.comFor Immediate ReleaseAmeren Announces 2023 Resultsand Issues Guidance for 2024 Earnings and Long-Term Growth•2023 Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) were $4.38, Compared to $4.14 in 2022•2024 Diluted EPS Guidance Range Established at $4.52 to $4.72•2024 through 2028 Diluted EPS Compound Annual Growth Rate Guidance of 6% to 8% using 2024 Guidance Midpoint as a BaseST. LOUIS (Feb. 22, 2024) — Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) today announced 2023 net income attributable to common shareholders of $1,152 million, or $4.38 per diluted share, compared to 2022 net income attributable to common shareholders of $1,074 million, or $4.14 per diluted share.Earnings results for 2023 were driven by solid operating performance and execution of the company's strategy. Higher earnings were the result of increased infrastructure investments across all business segments. Ameren Missouri earnings benefited from new electric service rates effective July 9, 2023. Earnings were also favorably impacted by lower Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois Natural Gas operations and maintenance expenses. Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution earnings benefited from a higher allowed return on equity due to a higher 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yield in 2023 compared to 2022. Ameren Parent earnings benefited from lower income tax expense due, in part, to the effect of favorable market returns on company-owned life insurance (COLI) investments. These favorable factors were partially offset by lower Ameren Missouri electric retail sales, primarily driven by weather, increased interest expense at Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois Natural Gas and Ameren Parent and lower energy efficiency performance incentives at Ameren Missouri in 2023 as compared to 2022. Finally, the earnings comparison also reflected higher weighted-average basic common shares outstanding."We made significant strides in executing our strategy during 2023 for the benefit of our customers, communities and shareholders," said Martin J. Lyons Jr., chairman, president and chief executive officer of Ameren Corporation.  "This included completing substantial energy infrastructure investments, updating Ameren Missouri's Integrated Resource Plan, which calls for a diverse mix of generation investments to most affordably and reliably meet customer needs, and receiving approval to build additional renewable generation and transmission resources. Our continued investments are driving safer, more reliable and resilient service for customers as we transition to a Page 1 of 5The following information was filed by Ameren Corp (AEE) on Thursday, February 22, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.
