Description

While trying to install ffmpeg with +amr:

alculating dependencies... done!

>>> Verifying ebuild manifests

!!! A file listed in the Manifest could not be found: /usr/portage/media-libs/opencore-amr/opencor�-amr-0.1.2.ebui�d

Those boxes are junk Unicode characters or something. I tried to open the manifest with various text editors, but I got a bunch of junk binary characters -- I think it's corrupted or something.

Either way, I'm completely unable to install opencore-amr, even when I manually downloaded it to $distfiles.

your filesystem appears to be screwed up, Manifest is proper in CVS -> not a sound@ bug, nothing we can do to fix your system

I guess so. Hurrah for silent reiserfs3 corruption on my SSD. Anyway, deleting the manifest and resyncing fixed the issue.
