I don't know whether gcc should have installed a gcj symlink, pdftk should look for a different binary for the compiler (perhaps by declaring a gcj_want variable or something?) or some other sort of wrapping around the slotted versions is missing, but pdftk won't compile out of the box. gcc is installed with the gcj USE flag, just in multiple versions/slots.

Well, this ebuild requires gcj and not gcjh. You didn't post emerge --info either; also, did you try to re-run gcc-config?

(In reply to comment #1)

This ebuild requires both gcj and gcjh.

Running gcc-config solved the problem outlined in this bug. Hopefully I won't get the compile errors I did when I manually provided symlinks to gcj and gcjh. That's stuff for a different bug though.

This bug seems done, closing. Thanks Jakob.

Lets resolve this properly, then... Thanks for reporting back.
