I found it odd that the section on installing additional components after the kernel mentioned nvidia-kernel but not nvidia-glx. Why is this? Are there other instructions needed for some one making a gentoo install that could be used with both ati/nvidia 3d cards?

Reproducible: Always

Information on getting nvidia/ati to work on Gentoo is at http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/nvidia-guide.xml and ati-faq.xml. The handbook section only described kernel modules; GLX is an X11 driver.
