Hello, with hardware buggy (It's router pc, I can't fix it), it regen the cache:
Caching network module dependencies
My wish is disable a cache or fix cache update detection (to not regen cache at each call).
The hardware show 2003 date.

Thanks.

I know this, but it's network without internet at the startup. It's correct workaround, but I search more real fix of openrc, in all case (I have too clock random change). I wish be safe with the software, in all case, like where the hardware is bad.
