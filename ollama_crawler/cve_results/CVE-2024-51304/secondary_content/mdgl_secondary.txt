 Inside Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
The Loan Facility contains event of default provisions for: our failure to make required payments or maintain compliance with covenants under the Loan Facility; our breach of certain representations or default under certain obligations outside the Loan Facility; insolvency, attachment or judgment events affecting us; and any circumstance which has occurred or could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on us, provided that, any failure to achieve approval or certain other milestones under the Loan Facility shall not in and of itself constitute a material adverse effect.



 M & A - Other   Highlight
Additionally, patients with NASH, especially those with more advanced metabolic risk factors (hypertension, concomitant type 2 diabetes), are at increased risk for adverse cardiovascular events and increased morbidity and mortality.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
The Loan Facility includes affirmative and restrictive financial covenants which commenced on January 1, 2023, including maintenance of a minimum cash, cash equivalents and liquid funds covenant of $35.0 million, which may decrease in certain circumstances if we achieve certain clinical milestones and a revenue milestone, and a revenue-based covenant that could apply commencing at or after the time that financial reporting is due for the quarter ending September 30, 2024.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Research and development costs are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities, including internal costs (including stock-based compensation), costs for consultants, milestone payments under licensing agreements, and other costs associated with our preclinical and clinical programs.

 Other - Other   Highlight
The risk-free rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.
