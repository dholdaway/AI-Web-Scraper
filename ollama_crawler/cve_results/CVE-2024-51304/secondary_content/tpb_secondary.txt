Graham Purdy, President and CEO, commented: “Our fourth quarter results were at the high-end of our expectations. The Zig-Zag segment was stable from the previous
          year excluding the impact of a discontinued product line and is well positioned to return to growth in 2024. Stoker’s had an outstanding quarter posting its highest growth rate in over four years led by double-digit growth year-over-year in
          Stoker’s MST. We also had strong free cash flow generation during the year allowing us to build a cash balance to address the remaining principal amount of our convertible notes at maturity in July. Our outlook for 2024 is positive as we expect
          solid growth in our Zig-Zag and Stoker’s Products businesses.”







Zig-Zag Products Segment (46% of total net sales in the quarter)


For the fourth quarter, Zig-Zag Products net sales decreased 2.9% to $45.1 million due to the discontinuation of an unprofitable product line in
          Canada that impacted sales by $1.4 million.


For the quarter, the Zig-Zag Products segment gross profit decreased 1.0% to $25.5 million. Gross margin increased 100 basis points to 56.5% driven by product mix.


For the full year, net sales of Zig-Zag Products decreased 5.2% to $180.5 million due to the reduction of trade inventory earlier in the year and the
          discontinuation of an unprofitable product line in Canada that impacted sales by $4.9 million.


For the full year, Zig-Zag Products segment gross profit decreased 5.2% to $101.1 million. Gross margin was steady at 56.0%.


“Our US Zig-Zag papers and alternative channel business posted a strong quarter with double-digit growth to close the year,” said Purdy. “With the
          reduction of trade inventory through the year, Zig-Zag is now positioned to return to growth aided by industry secular growth trends and internal growth initiatives.”


Stoker’s Products Segment (39% of total net sales in the quarter)


For the fourth quarter, Stoker’s Products net sales increased 18.6% to $38.0 million on double-digit growth of MST and high-single-digit growth of
          loose-leaf. For the fourth quarter, total Stoker’s Products segment volume increased 14.2%, while price / mix increased 4.4%.


For the quarter, the Stoker’s Products segment gross profit increased 27.2% to $21.9 million. Gross margin expanded 380 basis points to 57.6% due to MST pricing
          gains and operating leverage.


For the full year, net sales of Stoker’s Products increased 10.5% to $144.6 million on double-digit growth of MST and low-single-digit growth of
          loose-leaf. For the full year, total Stoker’s Products segment volume increased 4.2%, while price / mix increased 6.3%.


For the full year, the Stoker’s Products segment gross profit increased 14.9% to $81.9 million. Gross margin increased 210 basis points to 56.6% due to MST pricing
          gains.


“Stoker’s had an exceptional quarter with strong market share gains in both the MST and loose-leaf categories as its value proposition continues to resonate with
          consumers,” continued Purdy. “We are excited about the planned expansion of our FRĒ white nicotine pouch product throughout the year.”


Performance Measures in the Fourth Quarter


Fourth quarter consolidated selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $30.9 million compared to $31.2 million in the fourth
          quarter of 2022.


Fourth quarter SG&A included the following notable items:






•

$1.9 million of stock options, restricted stock and incentive expense compared to $1.2 million in the year-ago period







•

$1.0 million of FDA PMTA-related expenses for modern oral products compared to $0.3 million in the year-ago period

Total gross debt as of December 31, 2023 was $368.5 million. Net debt (total gross debt less unrestricted cash) at December 31, 2023 was $250.7 million. The Company ended the quarter with total liquidity of $177.9 million, comprised of $117.9 million in cash and $60.0 million of
            revolving credit facility capacity.


During the quarter, the Company received a net federal excise tax refund of $4.3 million, which is included in other operating income and $0.8 million of interest
          income related to the refund, which is included in net interest expense. The Company also recorded $4.0 million in other income related to a legal settlement receivable and a $1.0 million impairment of a minority investment in a development stage
          venture.
 

2024 Outlook


Management expects full-year 2024 adjusted EBITDA to be $95 to $100 million. This excludes any
          contribution from our CDS business which contributed a little over $2 million of EBITDA in FY 2023.


Creative Distribution Solutions (“CDS”) (15% of total net sales in the quarter)


For the fourth quarter, CDS net sales were $14.1 million, gross profit was $3.1 million, and gross margin was 22.4%.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures


To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, we use non-U.S.
          GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Operating Income (Loss). We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to management and investors
          regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) are used by
          management to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses and planning purposes and are presented to our board of directors. We believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Adjusted
          Gross Profit and Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) are appropriate measures of operating performance because they eliminate the impact of expenses that do not relate to business performance.


We define “EBITDA” as net income (loss) before interest expense, gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, depreciation and
          amortization. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as net income before interest expense, gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, depreciation, amortization, other non-cash items and other items that we do not
          consider ordinary course in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance. We define “Adjusted Net Income” as net income excluding items that we do not consider ordinary course in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance. We define
          “Adjusted Diluted EPS” as diluted earnings per share excluding items that we do not consider ordinary course in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance. We define “Adjusted Gross Profit: as gross profit excluding other non-cash items and
          other items that we do not consider ordinary course in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance. We define “Adjusted Operating Income (Loss)” as operating income  excluding other non-cash items and other items that we do not consider
          ordinary course in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance. We define “Free Cash Flow” as “Net Cash provided by operating activities” less Capital expenditures.
 

Non-U.S. GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted Net
          Income, Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted Diluted EPS, Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) exclude significant expenses that are required by U.S. GAAP to be recorded in our financial statements and are subject to inherent
          limitations. In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate these non-U.S. GAAP measure differently than we do or may not calculate it at all, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.


In accordance with SEC rules, we have provided, in the supplemental information attached, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the next directly comparable
          GAAP measures.
