With media-libs/gstreamer-0.10.8 listen-0.5_beta1-r2 doesn't find PyGSt. When I emerged media-libs/gstreamer-0.10.11 it succeeds all checks and builds correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.emerge media-libs/gstreamer-0.10.8
2.emerge media-sound/listen-0.5_beta1-r2

Shrug; so use 0.10.11 if it helps you. No real info to diagnose or fix the issue here.

gstreamer-0.10.11 is keyworded ~x86, and listen's dependencies say nothing about any specific version. Shouldn't >=gstreamer-0.10.11 be listed in the dependencies then?

You know, at the time this listen version was released, there was no gstreamer-0.10.11. So, either post something useful or live with it.

I can live with it. Just posted this to possibly help someone who didn't find a solution like I did.

Oh well. Thanks anyway.
