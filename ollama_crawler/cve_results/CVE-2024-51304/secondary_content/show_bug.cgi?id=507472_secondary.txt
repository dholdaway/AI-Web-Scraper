I don't think these will ever be added for 1.2.x, as 1.4.0 is expected in ~2 weeks time with upstream stable libav10 support.
Though I'm not sure if something needs to be done for 0.10 slot if libav10 can't coexist with older...

I guess at least 1.2.x should depend on libav < 10 as currently it just fails when libav 10 is installed.

Use 1.4.x for libav-10 support
