99999999 seems to be a typo and should be 9999 as [1] suggests.

Reproducible: Always

The 99999999 ebuild was introduced because of the introduction of YYYYMMDD ebuilds, and it's as valid as a version now as it was then.

*mtd-utils-99999999 (10 Mar 2009)

  10 Mar 2009; Raúl Porcel <armin76@gentoo.org> -mtd-utils-9999.ebuild,
  +mtd-utils-99999999.ebuild:
  Replace 9999 by 99999999, so its always newer


The developer handbook is both dated and incomplete.
