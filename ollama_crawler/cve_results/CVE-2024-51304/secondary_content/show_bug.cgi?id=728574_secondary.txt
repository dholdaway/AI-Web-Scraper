The dep's definitely there in dev-python/pytest-4.6.9+.  Please check your pytest version and verify that you have consistent depgraph.

I had dev-python/importlib_metadata installed but it didn't work. To fix the issue I had to re-emerge dev-python/importlib_metadata but I don't know why it fixed.
