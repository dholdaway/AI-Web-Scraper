Description

          2017-10-14 19:14:28 UTC
        

My /var/log/emerge-fetch.log is full of errors like:
Resolving ftp.romnet.org (ftp.romnet.org)... 2001:67c:1e0::4, 194.42.102.4
Connecting to ftp.romnet.org (ftp.romnet.org)|2001:67c:1e0::4|:80... failed: Connection refused.

Note that IPv6 on my machine is fully functional as the other entries in the log show:
Resolving mirrors.evowise.com (mirrors.evowise.com)... 2400:cb00:2048:1::6813:874b, 2400:cb00:2048:1::6813:884b, 2400:cb00:2048:1::6813:894b, ...

Reproducible: Always

Seems to work here.
