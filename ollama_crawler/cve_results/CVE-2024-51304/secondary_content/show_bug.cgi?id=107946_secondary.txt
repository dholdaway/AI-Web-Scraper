Description

          2005-10-02 18:11:06 UTC
        

the ./configure step complains that FreeType 7.0.1 or higher is not installed,
when in fact freetype-config --version reports that I have 9.8.3

EXTRA_ECONF="--disable-freetypetest" gets by the config problem, but then I get
this nastyness later on:

In file included from ../engine/PhysicsEngine.h:24,
                 from ../tank/TankPhysics.h:25,
                 from ../tank/Tank.h:27,
                 from ../tankgraph/TankModelRenderer.h:24,
                 from ../tankgraph/TankModelRenderer.cpp:21:
../ode/ode.h:43:27: ode/collision.h: No such file or directory
[ .... and much much more ]


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
FEATURES="-distcc" emerge -a =games-strategy/scorched3d-39.1
(turning off distcc just in case)

Actual Results:  
checking for FreeType -- version >= 7.0.1... no
configure: WARNING:

  The FreeType test program failed to run.  If your system uses
  shared libraries and they are installed outside the normal
  system library path, make sure the variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  (or whatever is appropiate for your system) is correctly set.

configure: error:
                FreeType2 must be installed on your system
                but freetype-config couldn't be found.
                Please check that freetype-config is in the path, the directory
                where the freetype libraries are installed (returned by
                'freetype-onfig --libs' command) is in LD_LIBRARY_PATH or
                equivalent variable and freetype version is 7.0.1 or above
                Try http://www.freetype.org to download freetype.

weird... the second time I ran the exact same emerge command (FEATURES="-distcc"
EXTRA_ECONF="--disable-freetypetest" emerge -a scorched3d) it compiled fine,
without the PhysicsEngine.h problem.

Regardless, the freetype issue still need to be addressed.

attach the config.log from the build directory as text/plain please.

The old work directory was gone from /var/tmp/portage, and when I tried to
re-emerge to generate a new config.log, everything configured just fine. The
problem is gone.

I upgraded my autoconf last night (from 2.57 or 2.58 to 2.59, I think) so maybe
that's what made the problem go away?

nevermind my old emerge info shows I was using autoconf 2.59 before as well.

/usr/X11R6/lib/libwx_gtk2-2.4.so: undefined reference to `pango_x_get_context'

That config.log is not from my computer, just attached for the record.
x11-libs/wxGTK-2.4.2-r3 was remerged but the problem remains. Seems to be a
Pango related, so as soon as I have access again to that computer I will
reemerge pango and then wxGTK and also a revdep-rebuild. :)
