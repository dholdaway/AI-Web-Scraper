kdebase-startkde drops one to a desktop with no functionality other than the limited things that can be done with a right click. the package is already large-ish, the addition of konsole and kicker would greatly increase usability without adding a great deal to the size(as far as i know anyway).

Many people don't use konsole. I myself use aterm.

As far as I understand, kdebase-startkde package is for those just want to log in KDE. konsole is totally unneeded.

Addition of kicker can be considerend though.

No wait. Kicker is also not necessary as many people use ksmoothdock etc. :)

kde without a way to access the kde menu tree(even if there isn't much there yet), and a terminal(any terminal, pick one)makes no sense. kdes'_default_ mouse setup is very limited, you can't access applications with it as you can with some other desktops,so i don't see the logic of rolling this up i an easily installed meta-package and leaving kicker out.

You may wish not to have kicker at all. Say a computer only running konqueror with internet access.
.kde/Autostart can be used to launch it at startup.
If you want kicker, emerge it. That is not a problem.
But joining the two into a single package would reduce freedom of choice :)

I think a post emerge message on what to do next, or that you need to emerge kicker to get kicker will do the job. There is no need to 'include' kicker imho.

The kicker part is solved as the following equery output shows:

kde-base/kcontrol-3.5.2

Looks like it's working correctly.
