Description

          2010-06-14 09:23:42 UTC
        

after upgrading to libxklavier-5, gnome-settings-daemon no longer builds:

gsd-keyboard-xkb.c: In function 'gsd_keyboard_xkb_shutdown':
gsd-keyboard-xkb.c:548: error: too few arguments to function 'xkl_engine_stop_listen'

libxklavier seems to have changed api (libxklavier/xkl_engine.h):
libxklavier-4:
extern gint xkl_engine_stop_listen(XklEngine * engine);
libxklavier-5:
extern gint xkl_engine_stop_listen(XklEngine * engine, guint flags);

valid flags should be:
typedef enum {
	XKLL_MANAGE_WINDOW_STATES = 0x01,
	XKLL_TRACK_KEYBOARD_STATE = 0x02,
	XKLL_MANAGE_LAYOUTS = 0x04
} XklEngineListenModes;

http://library.gnome.org/devel/libxklavier/unstable/libxklavier-XklEngine.html#XklEngineListenModes

not much documentation is available and i'm not really sure which of the flags are missing. any ideas? 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. upgrade to x11-libs/libxklavier-5
2. try to build gnome-base/gnome-settings-manager-2.28.2

It is known to fail, you need to use 2.30.1 instead

thanks for answering that quickly

2.30.1 is only available from gnome-overlay, right? 

libxklavier-5 is in the main tree right now and breaks 2.28.2 which is the latest gnome-settings-daemon available non-overlay. is using overlays the only way to successfully build gnome at the moment? i'm a little confused..

ppc64 is still at 2.26.1-r2, hence I am now running into this bug.  Using keyword ~ppc64 I was able to build 2.30.2-r1
