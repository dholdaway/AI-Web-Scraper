When using GMail compose on non-official Firefox ebuilds, it displays a nested
version of itself which is technically useable but definitely ugly and a pain.
It is especially so when the shrink-effect of the bug makes fonts unreadable.

Screenshot is attached.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Emerge www-client/mozilla-firefox
2. Log into GMail
3. Choose "Compose Mail"

Actual Results:  
The text area for entering the message body is contains a shrunken version of
itself which can be difficult to use due to troublesome fonts

Expected Results:  
The text area should just work normally

The corrupted scrollbars are a GTK+ 2.8-specific bug in the Smokey-Blue theme
(which will probably make me downgrade to GTK+ 2.6) which are, as far as I can
tell, unrelated to this one.

The GMail FAQ also explicitly states that non-official firefox builds can have
problems with GMail. However, I can't stand the slight sluggishness that the
official Firefox 1.5 build displays on Gentoo.

have you tested with a clean profile? I have just tested locally and all is well.

I just got back and, for whatever reason, it seems the bug vanished on it's own.
I can't duplicate it under any situation.
