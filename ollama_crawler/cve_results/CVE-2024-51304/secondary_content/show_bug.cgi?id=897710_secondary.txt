I can however install it as a binary from one of my binhosts, where it apparently did not fail.

Today I tried to upgrade to net-misc/iputils-20240117

and I got the same error again, with explicit ccache and distcc disabled

I'd guess this has something to do with the locales, since my current installation has a folder de with iputils.mo
