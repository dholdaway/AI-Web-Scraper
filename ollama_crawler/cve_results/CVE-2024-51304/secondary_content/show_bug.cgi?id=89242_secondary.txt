Description

IWBCMAN had the idea in the beginning and posted an ebuild and some patches at http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-323850-start-25-postdays-0-postorder-asc-highlight-.html which I had some problems with. I've fiddled with them and I created a fully functional ebuild and patchset. It works great here :)

I will attach the ebuilds and patches to this bug.

Note that you will need the following patches from a "stable" mozilla-firefox portage directory:
 * mozilla-firefox-1.0-4ft2.patch
 * svg-cairo-0.3.0-fix.patch

The needed directory structure is this one:
mozilla-firefox/
 * mozilla-firefox-1.0.2-r1.ebuild
 * files/
     * mozilla-firefox-1.0-4ft2.patch
     * mozilla-firefox_1.0.2-0ubuntu5.diff
     * mozilla-firefox-1.0.2-gtk-xft-only.diff
     * svg-cairo-0.3.0-fix.patch

Once you have that into /usr/local/portage/www-client/ (or w/e your PORTDIR_OVERLAY is set to, cd there, and do this:
ebuild mozilla-firefox-1.0.2-r1.ebuild digest

You may need to 
echo "www-client/mozilla-firefox ~x86 >> /etc/portage/package.keywords"

NOTE the >>, not > (that will remove EVERYTHING in package.keywords ... careful!)

Now simply emerge mozilla-firefox -av should do the trick.

Please post back any problems/suggestions!


Alex Roman.

This definately has my vote.

Firefox runs great with these patches and its even better when you use the
GNOME-fx theme! :)

Do any of you know where to find the patches for net new versions of firefox?
Google doesn't seem to know where they are, and they don't seem to be in ubuntus
repository of patches either.

Thanks.

FF 1.5 (unfortunately) already uses GTK fileselector, closing.
