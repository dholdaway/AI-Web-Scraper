Description

after running konqueror for some time (usually a day or more), input boxes and address bar get terribly slow. restarting konqueror fixes it. i tried using fresh ~/.kde. this problem has persisted throughout several upgrades.
a thread on bugs.kde.org suggested killing klipper but that didn't change anything.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start konqueror
2. use it
3. try entering text in url or form inputs

Actual Results:  
a dog slow browser

Could this be the same issue as described in bug 177446?
