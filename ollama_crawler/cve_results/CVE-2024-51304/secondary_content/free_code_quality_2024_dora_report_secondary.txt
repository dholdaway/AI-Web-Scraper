üåû ¬†Developer-Friendly Metrics

GitClear has set the industry standard in allowing Developers to control how their data is accessed. We
offer as many tools and reports for Developers as we do for their Managers. GitClear data promotes
2-way sharing between Developers and Managers.



üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ¬†Sniff out tech debt in existing code

Not only can GitClear pinpoint when duplicated and high-churn code is happening, our "tightly coupled change"
and "bug-prone file" detection help the team sift out the most problematic directories and files.



Pull request stats, velocity stats, DORA stats, code quality stats -- one GitClear account unlocks them all,
across more than 40 programming languages supported.

Reports offered in the basic free plan

Release frequency
Change lead time
Time to fix critical defects
Change failure rate
Diff Delta velocity
Copy/Paste (duplicated) code percent
Test and Documentation code percent
And many, many more....

"Industry Median" benchmark line is available with most reports for Pro+ subscribers.

üìè GitClear helps teams make measured decisions



"Tests" and "Documentation" are the cornerstones of code maintainability. How much are they happening on your team compared to industry norms?




Is legacy code being updated, or is the team preoccupied with churning lines that were recently authored?




How much code duplication is being seeded in your repos by AI assistants and Junior Developers? Is the team refactoring time-tested modules?



How much energy is being spent on different code areas? Who are your experts in the different languages your team uses?

GitClear isn't just a tool for code quality and Google DORA measurement. We also offer dynamically updating
images that can be used to glimpse your team's progress from your own dashboards, README files, and more.


For Developers, GitClear offers a unique pull request tool
that recognizes more granular changes than other
PR tools, saving review time. It can also summarize file- and PR-wide changes using AI. Our Developers' favorite chart is the
Commit Activity Browser
which summarizes recent progress across the team, taking the place of a daily stand-up meeting for many teams.





Commit Activity - Real-time glimpse at what the GitClear CEO has programmed lately

As seen in a GitHub profile


Commit Activity Bubbles

Shows recent work, with commits sized to approximated how much energy that went into completing each commit.
The set of commits can be color-coded by either


Issue/Jira ticket being worked
Repo
Branch
Code Category (shown in example)

Area Graph - All coding activity during Alloy.dev's past year, by repo

As seen on a GitHub profile


Area Graph

An area graph of some range (as little as a week, as much as 15 years) of a dev team's work.


Area segments can graph Diff Delta (a proxy for "energy required"), colored by
any number of available segments:


Git repo path
Issue/Jira ticket being worked
Type of work (bug fix, feature work, chore, tech debt, etc)
Code operation (add, delete, moved, replaced, copy/paste)


Recent work underway
is an optional section to list Jira tickets that you/team have been working on.
You configure the date range, tickets published, and repos eligible.
