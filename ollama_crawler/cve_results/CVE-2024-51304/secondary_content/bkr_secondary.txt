We successfully removed $150 million of costs, realigned our Industrial & Energy Technology (IET) segment, and recently launched actions to further streamline our Oilfield Services & Equipment segment (OFSE). Our strategy to transform the way we operate is working. In 2023, our adjusted EBITDA* was up double digits for the third consecutive year and exceeded prior cycle's peak levels by 25%. I would like to thank our employees for their hard work and commitment to achieve our goals, delivering for our customers, and pushing the Company forward," said Lorenzo Simonelli, Baker Hughes chairman and chief executive officer."During the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA* came in above the mid-point of our guidance range due to continued operational improvement and full realization of the $150 million of cost-out. IET orders remained strong, exceeding $3 billion for the fifth consecutive quarter. Additionally, we were awarded more than $1 billion of contractual service agreements (CSA), while we booked the previously announced 9.6 MTPA Ruwais Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) project in the United Arab Emirates.""In OFSE, we continue to demonstrate solid margin improvement, with segment EBITDA margin* increasing to 17.9% and Oilfield Services EBITDA margins* now exceeding 20% – both record margins. In new energy, orders of $169 million in the fourth quarter brought the full-year total to $750 million.""As you can see from our strong 2023 results, Baker Hughes is on its way to becoming a leaner and more efficient energy technology company. We continue to carefully execute our plan to drive margins meaningfully higher," concluded Simonelli.* Non-GAAP measure. See reconciliations in the section titled "Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Financial Measures." 1The following information was filed by Baker Hughes Co (BKR) on Tuesday, January 23, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.
