Assigning to proper maintainer.

%% qfile etc-update
sys-apps/portage (/usr/sbin/etc-update)

It seems like you're not using the normal etc-update script that comes with portage-2.1.6.4. You can use `type etc-update` to find out what is being called.

asrock ~ # type etc-update
etc-update is /usr/sbin/etc-update

asrock ~ # ls -la /usr/sbin/etc-update

It seems like it's using the correct etc-update version, so etc-update must be using the wrong portageq version. Please use `type portageq` to find out which portageq is being called.

Can you produce the deprecation warning with the --debug option enabled and post the output?

Somehow, the warning doesn't show anymore. I don't know what I did for this to happen.
You can close the bug.
Sorry for the inconveniences.
