That's right, you've put the bundle file in the wrong place.  It needs to go in /usr/portage/distfiles along with all your other installation files.  You should also make sure it isn't present further under /usr/portage/app-emulation.

I'm going to mark this as WORKSFORME, since there is a DIST entry for the bundle file[1] (not an AUX entry that would be required for it to exist under the ebuild directory).  Please feel free to reopen this bug if that doesn't solve your problem...

Putting the download in /usr/portage/distfiles worked, of course... I didn't remember the correct place, because in all other cases, it is mentioned when there is an instrcution in the ebuild. Should I re-open the bug just for that change (adding the instruction where to put the download file)?
