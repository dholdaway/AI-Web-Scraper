Description


Rabbe Fogelholm

I have the app-admin/sudo package installed. Recently version 1.6.9_p13 was installed, as part of a weekly `emerge -avuND --world'.

Afterwards I became aware that I could no longer execute some commands via sudo. The message I got was 

sudo: /etc/sudoers is mode 0644, should be 0440

Having set the '0440' mode on /etc/sudoers things were back to normal.

My sudoers file is quite simple, just a single line site-specific line. Unfortunately I am not quite sure if I ran etc-update or cfg-update -u after the upgrade. In any case there were no warnings or messages about /etc/sudoers that I became aware of.

As you can see I am not 100% certain how to classify this issue. A bug in /etc/sudo, or a bug in portage, or me not doing the upgrade with enough care?

I really cannot seem to be able to reproduce the problem; please do reopen if the problem persists.

I think it is safe to close this bug. I checked the machine where I am using sudo; it is now at sudo version 1.7.1-r1. From the emerge.log I can see that I have been at versions 1.6.9_p16, 1.6.9_p17, and 1.7.0. All of these versions have been problem-free for me.
