Description

If media-fonts/corefonts isn't present on a system, myth-setup (which is a required part of setting up MythTV) will only render empty boxes when trying to display text.

I presume corefonts automatically gets pulled in on systems where X11 will be used, but on headless machines it's left out. Maybe the emerge --info holds some secrets.

Reproducible: Always

Which version of myth are you using?

Personally, I've never had it installed, and never had font issues.  It could be missing some generic font, and not necessarily corefonts.  liberation-fonts might work as well.

MythTV actually includes it's own free font which it will use as a fallback. I actually used that font for ages since I never had any font packages installed on my system until I gave my myth look a make over and used some nicer looking fonts. I still don't have corefonts installed on that machine, though.

can't dupe this one, and if its still an issue, which version of myth are you using?

I just had this. I started with a fresh system, headless, as it's a duplicate of a server for testing. This was mainly used for MythTV 0.22 testing.

When I got everything setup, then emerged MythTV (0.22), everything went fine. I then ran setup, and was unable to see nothing but squares. I did a quick search, and it came up about corefonts. I installed them, and I was able to see everything. It seems with not installing X, something else doesn't get installed to use the fallback font. 
When I get home this evening I can post --info if people would like to see it.
