Hi Gentoo PR

Is the attached text (contributed by Thomas Anderson - gentoofan23)
good enough to be put on Gentoo.org's main website as a news item?
Even though it has brief coverage in GMN, this is still a major
milestone for Gentoo and should be put on the site imo.

Wkr,
 Sven Vermeulen

The Gentoo Council, at their meeting on the 25th of September,
approved new features that ebuilds, Gentoo's packaging format, can use.
These improvements allow the developers to write packages with more ease and
also provides users with benefits. The major features introduced by this approval
are:
	* A new meaning for blockers.  has been added to distinguish between
	packages that cannot be installed temporarily and those than can.

	* One of the major features accepted was USE dependencies. Portage can now
	accept dependencies on a package being built with a certain set of USE
	flags. This means that you will be notified of needed changes 
	before you start compiling. This feature was a blocker for KDE 4.1 
	ebuilds from entering the tree.

	* New phases. Two new ebuild phases, src_prepare and src_configure were
	added. For you this means easier resumes from broken compiles.

As of this announcement, both >=sys-apps/paludis-0.30.1 and
>=sys-apps/portage-2.2_rc11 support these features.

Discuss this!

At some point, this becomes irrelavant. 

However, my only review is to drop $PM bias and only say that "stable portage" now supports it or so. Or else we have to say every PM supports it, not needed IMO (but i have nothing against other PMs FTR)

Long since dead, I don't care anymore.

Meh. I already stuck something in the newsletter a long time ago. It's not really anything that average end-users need to know about. Mostly only ebuild writers.
