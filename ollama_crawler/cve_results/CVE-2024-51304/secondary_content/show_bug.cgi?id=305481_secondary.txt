Ever since Konqueror 4.3.98, I have been unable to get the web shortcuts settings dialog to show anything.  To go along with this, I have to enter the full URL (including http://) or I get the message "Protocol not supported".

I have done everything from removing my ~/.kde4 folder (several times) to installing kdebase-runtime-meta (as I kept getting a message from KDE packages telling me that I wouldn't get support if I didn't have that or kdebase-startkde installed).

I am running e17 as a window manager, so I don't have the entirety of KDE installed, but I don't think this should be a problem.  I really like some KDE applications, but heavily prefer e17 as a graphical environment.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Emerge konqueror, konq-plugins, and nsplugins without any extra KDE stuff
2. Start konqueror from a non-kde environment
3. Open up the Settings->Configure Konqueror
4. Click on Web Shortcuts

Actual Results:  
No actual settings show up in the main portion of the settings window for Web Shortcuts.  Everything else works fine.  Also, there is no automatic url expansion from something like "google.com" to "http://www.google.com/" - thus, entering anything short of the full URL results in "Protocol not supported" errors.

Expected Results:  
Settings for Web Shortcuts to show up in the main settings dialog, and automatic URL expansion so that entering "google.com" takes you to "http://www.google.com/"

I should mention that the URL above is a URL to a screenshot of what I see.

Also, I pastebinned my emerge --info: http://pastebin.ca/1799533

Argh.  Figures it'd fix itself after restarting the computer.  Restarting never worked before, but something I installed along with kdebase-runtime-meta (or possibly updating to 4.4.0) must have initialized the fixing process, and restarting finished it.

I've got the same issue here. But a computer reboot did not fix it!
If this is a dependency issue, this bug should be reopened...

Any hints to fix it?
Do you remember which packages of kdebase-runtime-meta you have installed after having experimented this bug?

Thanks.

the  missing dependency is kde-base/kurifilter-plugins.
But as the warning says, no support is given to user without kdebase-runtime-meta =(
