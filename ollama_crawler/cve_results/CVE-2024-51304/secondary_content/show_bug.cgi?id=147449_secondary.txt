Hi,

after upgrading kaffeine to version 0.8.2 I can't use any part of kaffeine which relies on xine-lib. When starting kaffeine a windows opens which contains the following message:


Loading of player part 'xine_part' failed.
Details
xine_part.desktop not found in search path.


although I have that file installed in /usr/share/services/xine_part.desktop

As a result, the "Player" menu is completely empty.

Cheers
Poly-C

After upgrading from 0.8.1-r1 to 0.8.2-r1, I actually don't see anything at all, kaffeine just doesn't start and it doesn't print anything that could help to find the error. Sadly, the old version is removed from the tree. So these problems could be related somehow.

Hi,

alright... kaffeine-0.8.2 now works here. I don't know if it's due to a recent update to kdelibs-3.5.4-r2 or because I restarted X...

Marking this bug as WORKSFORME

Cheers

It still doesn't work here with kdelibs-3.5.2-r6. Maybe we can find out where the difference is and apply a patch to the stable kdelibs?
The bug should be reopened, IMHO

Have you tried to check the libutil issue at bug# 148179 ?
Cause it works for we all and not for you it could be something
kdelibs compiled against and not the kdelibs itself.....

No, it's not this issue:

equery b /usr/lib/libutil.so

[ Searching for file(s) /usr/lib/libutil.so in *... ]
sys-libs/glibc-2.4-r3 (/usr/lib/libutil.so -> ../../lib/libutil.so.1)

So I think there is another problem.
