After installation and set up of cacti, the application cannot query snmp devices. Re-compiling php with the snmp USE flag enabled solves the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have/install dev-lang/php without snmp enabled
2. emerge net-analyzer/cacti (snmp and vhosts USE flags were enabled)
3. Follow cacti installation instructions. Add a snmp device using cacti and see "Associated Data Queries". The "run debug query" link produces resulting error messages.

Thank you for report, Scott. Actually cacti can use three ways to query snmp devices:
- via snmpwalk command line utility
- via internal php snmp
- via cacti-spine

I failed to find where all three are mentioned in official documentation but first two are mentioned e.g. here:
http://www.cacti.net/downloads/docs/html/faq.html#AEN2339

Afaik all those three should work. Seems that you just misconfigured something. If that's not the case, enabled debugging in cacti like described here:

http://docs.cacti.net/node/283

gather logs and reopen bug, please.
