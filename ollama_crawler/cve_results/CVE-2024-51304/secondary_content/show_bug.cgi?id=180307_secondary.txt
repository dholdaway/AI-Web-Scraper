Is this a known issue with a "fix" coming or is this "by design" (which seems shockingly short-sighted). I searched bugs.gentoo.org for quite a while and didn't see anything like this amongst the bajillion other portage bugs

Why can't I just search for an exact package (like to find out which versions I have installed/available, or other info).

daevid ~ # esearch python | less

Yes, I can use eix, but I don't have this on all my boxes, nor do I want to install it and maintain yet another package cache and all that (for example, on a dev VMWare guest that I want to keep as small as possible).

daevid ~ # eix dev-lang/python

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
I get 54 packages I have to sift through, despite the fact that I proved the exact package to esearch.

Expected Results:  
It should have shown me the exact package that I told it to find.

Well, it's by design, however maybe you should try with the --fullname option ;)

Fair enough. That does work, but it still seems cumbersome and I'd like to see 'esearch' just be smarter and realize that if there's a 'category/package', to just find that rather than me having to use --fullname

This would allow for combinations on the same command line too.

dae51d@daevid ~ $ esearch app-portage/eix python
[ Results for search key : app-portage/eix ]
[ Applications found : 0 ]

[ Results for search key : python ]
[ Applications found : 54 ]

dae51d@daevid ~ $ esearch --fullname app-portage/eix python
[ Results for search key : app-portage/eix ]
[ Applications found : 1 ]

*  app-portage/eix
      Latest version available: 0.9.1
      Latest version installed: 0.7.9
      Size of downloaded files: [no/bad digest]
      Homepage:    http://eix.sourceforge.net
      ...

[ Results for search key : python ]
[ Applications found : 313 ]

where are those 313 coming from? there should be 54.

The 313 come because it now also matches teh category part, so it also finds everything in dev-python.

Unfortunately, esearch is no longer being maintained by the upstream developer. This will need a patch submitted in order to be fixed.

I've just implemented an automatic fullname detection and enabling in esearch.

So it will work with multiple pkgnames on the same command, some being fullname, some not.

git commit: 9b6c804f2498cb27875b9be806b5fd5c39c5aa15

It is now being developed again by Paul Varner and myself.
