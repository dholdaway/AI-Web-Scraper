Exhibit 99.1Press ReleaseBio-Rad Reports Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2023 Financial ResultsHERCULES, Calif.—February 15, 2024 -- Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE: BIO and BIO.B), a global leader in life science research and clinical diagnostics products, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.Fourth-quarter 2023 total net sales were $681.2 million, a decrease of 6.7 percent compared to $730.3 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2022. On a currency-neutral basis, quarterly sales decreased 7.7 percent compared to the same period in 2022. COVID-related sales were approximately $0.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 versus approximately $13.4 million in the year ago period. Excluding COVID-related sales, revenue decreased 6.0 percent on a currency-neutral basis.Life Science segment net sales for the fourth quarter were $291.1 million, a decline of 19.1 percent compared to the same period in 2022. On a currency-neutral basis, Life Science segment sales decreased by 19.9 percent compared to the same quarter in 2022. Excluding COVID-related sales, Life Science revenue decreased 17.0 percent. The decline was broad-based, primarily due to lower sales of ddPCR, qPCR, and Western blotting products.  Clinical Diagnostics segment net sales for the fourth quarter were $389.0 million, an increase of 5.3 percent compared to the same period in 2022. On a currency-neutral basis, net sales increased 4.2 percent versus the same quarter last year. Excluding COVID-related sales, Clinical Diagnostics revenue increased 4.3 percent year over year, on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong demand for diabetes and quality control related products. Fourth-quarter gross margin was 53.8 percent compared to 54.4 percent during the fourth quarter of 2022.Income from operations during the fourth quarter of 2023 was $95.3 million versus $118.7 million during the same quarter last year. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $349.7 million, or $12.14 per share, on a diluted basis, versus net income of $827.7 million, or $27.78 per share, on a diluted basis, during the same period in 2022. Net income amounts for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022 were primarily impacted by the recognition of changes in the fair market value of equity securities related to the holdings of the company’s investment in Sartorius AG.The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 18.4 percent, compared to 24.2 percent for the same period in 2022. The tax rates for both periods were driven by the unrealized gain in equity securities. The lower rate in 2023 was primarily driven by a geographical mix of earnings.“The ongoing weakness in biopharma markets continued to impact our fourth-quarter 2023 results, which were largely in line with expectations,” said Norman Schwartz, Bio-Rad’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Shifting focus to 2024, our full-year outlook reflects ongoing execution of our corporate transformation initiatives, effective expense management, and a cautiously optimistic view of a gradual biopharma sector recovery in the second half of the year,” Mr. Schwartz continued. “We also recognize the efforts of our global employees, whose ongoing dedication and commitment to our customers’ success helped us navigate the challenges of 2023.”The non-GAAP financial measures discussed below exclude certain items detailed later in this press release under the heading “Use of Non-GAAP and Currency-Neutral Reporting.” A reconciliation between historical GAAP operating results and non-GAAP operating results is provided following the financial statements that are part of this press release.1The following information was filed by Biorad Laboratories, Inc. (BIO) on Thursday, February 15, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.
