Hm, can't reproduce this with musl even with old -r0 -- been some time, so maybe something else changed. I'll close this one and see if it resurfaces.

Thought may be misdetection given the test environment doesn't have the libc installed in ${ROOT} and tests try to understand that which could've been different if musl, but find-unresolved tests pass fine.
