 Financial Highlights


 
•The CET1 capital ratio increased 3 basis points to an estimated 10.98% at December 31, 2023, compared with 10.95% at September 30, 2023, modestly strengthening the Company's capital position.
•Net interest margin of 3.61% in the recent quarter narrowed from 3.79% in the third quarter of 2023 reflecting higher costs paid on deposits amidst a continued shift of customer funds to interest-bearing products.
•Growth in average commercial and industrial loans in the recent quarter was largely offset by a decline in commercial real estate loans.
•Reflecting continued demand for interest-bearing products, average deposits increased 1% from the third quarter of 2023.
•Higher provision for credit losses in the recent quarter reflects continued pressure on investor-owned commercial real estate borrowers and a $1.7 billion increase in loan balances from September 30, 2023 to December 31, 2023.
•Noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2023 includes an FDIC special assessment of $197 million ($146 million net of tax or $0.88 of diluted earnings per common share).





 Chief Financial Officer Commentary


"M&T enters 2024 with stronger levels of capital, liquidity and credit reserves than a year earlier. Average commercial and consumer loans as well as average deposits all increased in the final quarter of 2023, and expenses remained well controlled after considering the FDIC special assessment. With commercial real estate values and higher interest rates impacting our commercial clientele, our relationship-based approach gives us confidence in our ability to work through those challenges with our customers and appropriately assess the associated credit risk and loss reserves. Over the past year we have strengthened relationships with our customers and welcomed new ones. We thank our employees for consistently showing up within the communities we serve to make a difference."
- Daryl N. Bible, M&T's Chief Financial Officer
