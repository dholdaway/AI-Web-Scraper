Description

It's unclear where FEATURES=nostrip should be set if in make.conf or as a system variable. If as system variable then I suggest to change "is to emerge the program with FEATURES=\"nostrip\"" to "is to emerge the program and make sure
you run the emerge program with environment variable FEATURES set to \"nostrip\""

Or maybe instead of "set to \"nostrip\"" "containing \"nostrip\"", I don't know
how the mechanism works inside and whether the FEATURES variable can be necessary for something else too.

The same for

Any of those ways work. If you do it in your /etc/make.conf, you can just add it to the existant space-separated list, in case you choose to use environment variable, specifying FEATURES=nostrip is enough as this setting is additive.

Chris, what about mentioning the "splitdebug" feature?

That's what you've included in the $URL.

> http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gentoolkit.xml
> http://wwwredesign.gentoo.org/doc/en/gentoolkit.xml

That comes from the output of `equery` which in turn processes data from your profile. There's no point in fixing it.

Um. I suppose it has to be done, but FEATURES includes a ton of options for bleeding edge/unstable utilities (some of which aren't even in Portage, such as confcache). I think some FEATURES descriptions would be okay, but it might be better if it was placed in the dev docs, or on the respective /proj/ pages. Besides, things like FEATURES="distcc" are already covered in specific docs that address the FEATURE in question, or are mentioned in the Portage handbook. (I'd think that the handbook would be a good place for FEATURES stuff ;).)

Or were you referring to this feature, specifically?

My vote goes to wontfix. The example shows exactly how to use FEATURES=....

yeah, this document is not for covering FEATURES

other documents already tackle that

The problem is that if a user comes and wants to compile with debug and never read about FEATURE he will not know what to do, where to put those FEATURES. The fact that some document somewhere else describes FEATURES doesn't help because the original document doesn't link to it.

I don't understand why you refuse to put the small change I suggested in, whether the tiny increase in text size is a problem or you don't want to waste the tiny amount of time necessary to do the change?

Anyway if you don't want to to this I suggest at least the words FEATURES to be a hyperlink linking to the document describing the FEATURES.

You cannot expect users to first learn every aspect of Gentoo and only after that use it. That's possible for a couple of people - gentoo developers - but not general users. Even if someone studied gentoo completely first he would likely forget the stuff quickly.

Therefore it's necessary to accomodate the manuals so the user can fill in the missing knowledge on the fly without a need for dead spots where he doesn't know what to do or without a need for googling because that takes time and creates error (the user can be misled to old, obsolete page or some unauthorized 3rd page containing incorrect information)

uhh, which part of the document did you not read ?  it clearly shows you how to set FEATURES such that it works:

Code Listing 2.4: Re-emergeing a package with debugging
# FEATURES="nostrip" emerge package

Users should read the Handbook before using Gentoo ("using" == "acting as a sysadmin").

That wasn't very polite.

And can we expect them to read the Handbook?

Come on, if you had read the relevant section of Handbook, you would know where to set FEATURES. See http://www.gentoo.org/doc/cs/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=2&chap=3

Works for me.
