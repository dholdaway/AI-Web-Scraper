When trying to print certain web pages, for example http://forums.gentoo.org Konqueror crashes, and leaves the "Printing Status" popup displayed. Any attached tabs are lost, but other Konqueror windows that are running are unaffected.

Other web pages, for example: http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-507362.html print as expected. Printing the same page in Firefox 1.5 works as expected.

I have confirmed this behaviour using AMD64 & x86 arches, printing to a shared Epson Stylus Color 760 via cups version 1.1.23-r8 (physically attached to the AMD64 PC)

Konqueror version: 3.5.2 (using KDE version 3.5.2)

For my AMD64 system:

Created attachment 100463 [details]
emerge --info for AMD64 system

Added emerge --info for my AMD64 system.

Would you prefer I reported the bug upstream?

Having just upgraded, I can also confirm that this bug affects Konqueror 3.5.5 using KDE version 3.5.5

Is no-one interested in this bug?

Yes, probably should report upstream along with a backtrace with debug symbols of what happens during the crash.

Same problem with a psotscript printer! I am not able to make a backtrace since konqueror 3.5.5 disapears instantanly when printing

See [1] for getting backtraces.

Does this still occur? It works perfectly fine for me. 

Did you file an upstream bug and if so, could you please provide us with a link 
to it? Thanks!

The problem is currently unresolved for me (Konqueror 3.5.5). There are lots of printing related bugs on the konqueror bugzilla, some open for _years_ and I didn't have time to search through them all to see if it's already reported, so I didn't bother. Sorry. My workaround was to use Firefox if I need to print a web page.

Well, works for me and why should we bother if you don't?

I never said you should. Clearly konqueror has a problem here (at least on systems I set up), but due to the fact that:

1. The KDE bugzilla has so many printing bugs.
2. The KDE devs are very impolite about people posting dupes.
3. The lack of action on confirmed bugs.

I decided rather than spend hours wading through KDE's bugzilla to see if it's been reported, I'd work-around as I said above.

As it "works for you" it means I've likely set something up wrong, so I'll just have to investigate some more.
