 Inside Rockwell Automation Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Income   Highlight
See Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS, and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate Reconciliation for a reconciliation of Net income attributable to Rockwell Automation, diluted EPS, and effective tax rate to adjusted income, adjusted EPS, and adjusted effective tax rate, respectively, and a discussion of why we believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors.



 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Results of Operations Non-GAAP Measures The following discussion includes organic sales, total segment operating earnings and margin, adjusted income, adjusted EPS, adjusted effective tax rate, and free cash flow, which are non-GAAP measures.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
Our long-term profitable growth framework outlines how we will deliver accelerated growth while we continue to transform our company to meet stakeholder expectations over the longer term: achieve faster secular growth in traditional markets due to customer needs for resiliency (including cybersecurity), agility, sustainability, and mitigating impacts of labor shortages; grow share and create new ways to win through technology differentiation, industry focus, go to market acceleration, expanded offerings and new markets; accelerate growth in annual recurring revenue; add 1% growth from acquisitions annually; and deliver profitable growth within a disciplined financial framework.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
We believe that Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS, and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate provide useful information to our investors about our operating performance and allow management and investors to compare our operating performance period over period.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Critical assumptions used in this approach included management's estimated future revenue growth rates and margins, a discount rate, and a market multiple.
