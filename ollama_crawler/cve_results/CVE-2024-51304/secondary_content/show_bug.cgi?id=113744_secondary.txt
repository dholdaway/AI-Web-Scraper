Hello I use bugzilla for the first time. I created a rc-script for module acerhk and one counseled me of you to  
submit it. It serves to activate the wireless on the laptop during the init and avoids a time out during  
net.wlan0 start  

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
the script activates the switch before the activation of the wireless (net.xxx start)   
the script is here : http://naerex.free.fr/scripts/acer-switch  
i use it and it work perfectly ! 


sorry for english ;)
