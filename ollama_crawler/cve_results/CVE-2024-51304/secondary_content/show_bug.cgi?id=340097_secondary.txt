after installing texmkaer 2.0 , there is an empty window. but after installing  gnome-base/gconf it is ok. when i remove gconf, the window will be empty again, and i can't exit texmaker.

gnome-base/gconf should be added to dependency

works fine here without gconf and texmaker 2.1; could you please try with this version and, if the problem persists, see if there are no more descriptive error messages ?
