# emerge -pv webcollage

These are the packages that would be merged, in order:

Calculating dependencies   
emerge: there are no ebuilds to satisfy "webcollage".

webcollage is not an ebuild. It's a screensaver that comes with xscreensaver.
See http://jwz.org/xscreensaver

Great. Try to post some description of the bug next time you file one, will be really helpful.

This screensaver might be under the "insecure-savers" useflag, its just a guess though.

You have to have USE="offensive" to get it. Now.. if you could post that `emerge -pv xscreensaver`...

USE="insecure-savers" did nothing. emerge -pv says:

localhost ~ # emerge -pv xscreensaver

These are the packages that would be merged, in order:

Calculating dependencies... done!

I don't have this problem. Could you attach build log?

Uhm, the webcollage thing is clearly installed... Really don't see what's your issue here.

>>> /usr/lib/misc/xscreensaver/webcollage-helper
>>> /usr/lib/misc/xscreensaver/webcollage
>>> /usr/share/xscreensaver/config/webcollage.xml
>>> /usr/share/man/man6/webcollage.6.gz

Hm, you're right. Adding it to ~/.xscreensaver seems to fix things. I wonder why it wasn't there to begin with.

That closes the thing, I'd say... :)
