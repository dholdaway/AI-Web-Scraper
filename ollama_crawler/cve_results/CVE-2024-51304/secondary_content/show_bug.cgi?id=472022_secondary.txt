app-arch/libpar2-0.3 need somes patches included in the nzbget distribution.
nzbget compilation fail with USE flag "parcheck"
All information about theses patches is in the README file inside the nzbget archive.
Compilation with the parcheck use flag can be done with ./configure --disable-libpar2-bugfixes-check

Reproducible: Always

>=app-arch/libpar2-0.2.1 includes these patches and nzbget builds fine against it with parcheck enabled.

If you get build failures, reopen and attach a build log.
