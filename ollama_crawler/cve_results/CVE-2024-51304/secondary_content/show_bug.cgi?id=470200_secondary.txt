Description


vax456





          2013-05-17 20:40:33 UTC
        

In Gnome 3.8, when adding a Google account, gnome-control-center segfaults in a shared library belonging to json-c.  This occured when using =dev-libs/json-c-0.9-r1.

After upgrading to =dev-libs/json-c-0.11, the segfault stopped and I was able to add a Google account.  I didn't test if it worked with =dev-libs/json-c-0.10-r1.

The problem is that with no trace, it is hard to say why it went to json-c since the library is not linked by gnome-online-accounts...

# qdepends -Q json-c 2> /dev/null
dev-libs/libreport-2.0.13
media-sound/pulseaudio-4.0

I quick grep through NEEDED.ELF.2 also does not raise more results which is normal hence I am reopening this bug report as I will drop json-c from g-o-a dependencies with no further proofs of the problem.

+  01 Jul 2013; Pacho Ramos <pacho@gentoo.org>
+  gnome-online-accounts-3.8.2.ebuild:
+  Drop json-c dep as discussed in #470200 with Gilles, since I can neither
+  reproduce the problem *now* (I was some months ago). Feel free to reopen if
+  you still suffer the problem with latest versions.
