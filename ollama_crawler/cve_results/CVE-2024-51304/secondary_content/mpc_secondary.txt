 Inside Marathon Petroleum Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Debt   Highlight
However, any downgrades of MPLX senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings could increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under such agreements.



 Financial - Debt   Highlight
However, any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt could increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under such agreements and may limit our flexibility to obtain financing in the future, including to refinance existing indebtedness.

 Financial - Debt   Highlight
In addition, a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment-grade levels could, under certain circumstances, impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis and could result in us having to post letters of credit under existing transportation services or other agreements.

 Other - Other   Highlight
This could result in the deconsolidation or consolidation of the affected subsidiary, which would have a significant impact on our financial statements.

 Legal - Other   Highlight
