transfig issues, the gocr build script doesn't bail out on them and problems with the ghostscript command. I'm using media-gfx/transfig-3.2.4-r2 and app-text/ghostscript-esp-8.15.3.

Not worth a separate bug:

 * QA Notice: USE Flag 'tk' not in IUSE for app-text/gocr-0.43

Not worth a separate bug:

functions.c have missing include:
#include <string.h> 
will fix the issue, please send upstream a note about this.

 * QA Notice: Package has poor programming practices which may compile
 *            fine but exhibit random runtime failures.
 * functions.c:33: warning: incompatible implicit declaration of built-in function ‘strchr’
functions.c:36: warning: incompatible implicit declaration of built-in function ‘strstr’
functions.c:50: warning: incompatible implicit declaration of built-in function ‘strlen’
