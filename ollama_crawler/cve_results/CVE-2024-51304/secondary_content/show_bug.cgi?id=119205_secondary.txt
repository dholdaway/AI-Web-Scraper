Description

          2006-01-16 08:46:37 UTC
        

dmesg command displays after my cdrom characteristics the following message:
Losing some ticks... checking if CPU frequency changed.
With the vanilla-sources-2.6.15, I don't have this message.
But if I patch the vanilla-sources with fbsplash, the message "Losing some ticks" appears again.
The message is the only problem that have been to face to.

Same problems with gentoo-sources-2.6.17.
Have you a tip to solve this problem ?

Same problems with kernels up to 2.6.18-gentoo.

Is this still a problem with 2.6.23?

I'm not tested it on the lastest gentoo kernel and today I didn't use fbsplash at all.

This warning message was removed by kernel commit 1489939f0ab64b96998e04068c516c39afe296, so I guess it's no longer a problem.
