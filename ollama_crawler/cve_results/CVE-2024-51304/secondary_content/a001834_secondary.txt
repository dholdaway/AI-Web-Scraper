Abstract
Neuronal migration is, along with axon guidance, one of the fundamental mechanisms underlying the wiring of the brain. As
                     other organs, the nervous system has acquired the ability to grow both in size and complexity by using migration as a strategy
                     to position cell types from different origins into specific coordinates, allowing for the generation of brain circuitries.
                     Guidance of migrating neurons shares many features with axon guidance, from the use of substrates to the specific cues regulating
                     chemotaxis. There are, however, important differences in the cell biology of these two processes. The most evident case is
                     nucleokinesis, which is an essential component of migration that needs to be integrated within the guidance of the cell. Perhaps
                     more surprisingly, the cellular mechanisms underlying the response of the leading process of migrating cells to guidance cues
                     might be different to those involved in growth cone steering, at least for some neuronal populations.
