Since this is now more than a year old, I'll close it up as I've not seen other users reporting this.

Feel free to re-open with an up-to-date system.

Thanks!

I am currently hitting this, albeit with pcmanfm-qt-0.16.0-r1. I already did the migration to 17.1, and everything seems to be in order. Out of a world update, I only had this package fail due to the same error as reported. Attaching --info and build log.
