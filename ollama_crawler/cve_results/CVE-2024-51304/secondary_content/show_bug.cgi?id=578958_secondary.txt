After upgrading, I get the following preserve-libs message:

>> package: net-libs/libvncserver-0.9.10_p20160127
 *  - /usr/lib64/libvncserver.so.0
 *  - /usr/lib64/libvncserver.so.0.0.0
 *      used by /usr/bin/x11vnc (x11-misc/x11vnc-0.9.14)
 *  - /usr/lib64/libvncclient.so.0
 *  - /usr/lib64/libvncclient.so.0.0.0
 *      used by /usr/bin/x11vnc (x11-misc/x11vnc-0.9.14)

A subslot should be added to the libvncserver ebuild, and reverse dependencies should be adjusted to use it.

for now, I'll leave it as is. I'll make subslots when the ABI actually changes (or if I decide to change it to use cmake)

From IRC:

[11:16:45] <floppym> libvncserver seems like a straightforward soname bump, which is generally handed via a subslot.
[11:18:47] <Hello71> actually, here the ABI hasn't changed (AFAICT)
[11:19:07] <floppym> Then why was soname changed?
[11:19:51] <Hello71> yes, the cmake and autotools versions don't even match
[11:20:00] <floppym> Heh, silly upstream.
[11:20:02] <Hello71> one produces 0.9.10 and the other makes 1.0.0

I still don't know why they changed the soname to .1, but it does seem to be official and matching on cmake and autotools. However, it's a bit late now to be adding subslots, so I'll do that if they change it again.
