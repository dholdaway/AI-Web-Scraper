tried fakenes on amd64 and ppc and only hear a glitch/pop.  building with openal and there is sound after selecting openal from fakenes menu.

am i missing something with allegro sound ?

should openal be set for default in the ebuild and the options for fakenes so the user doesnt have to set that ?

allegro sound works fine for me so it sounds like something is missing on your box.  Since it's possible to select from the menu in the emulator to get it working I don't think any changes to the ebuild are necessary.
