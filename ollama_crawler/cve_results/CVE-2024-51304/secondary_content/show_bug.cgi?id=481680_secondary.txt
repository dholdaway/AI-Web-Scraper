Description

          2013-08-19 19:18:55 UTC
        

I'm running www-client/firefox-23.0 

iirc, in previous ff versions when a user selected "File"  -->  "New Private Window", the new ff private window that was created had an indication of its private status in the title bar (somewhere else??).

afaict, using ff-23.0, a ff private window has no indication that it is private.

if I am wrong and previous versions did not have a private window indication, imo, there should be such an indication.

if I am correct that previous versions did indicate that an ff window was private I would like to see a return of that indicator.

or worse...

in ff-23.0, selecting "New Private Window" functionality is broken and it's creating a NON-private standard ff window.

Are you able to duplicate your results with a clean profile? As you can see in screenshot private browsing works fine.

Thank you for your response.

I'm not sure what you mean by a "clean" profile.

As you can see below, I'm using the 'desktop' profile.

# eselect profile list
Available profile symlink targets:
  [1]   default/linux/amd64/13.0
  [2]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/selinux
  [3]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop *
  [4]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/gnome
  [5]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/kde
  [6]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/developer
  [7]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/no-multilib
  [8]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/x32
  [9]   hardened/linux/amd64
  [10]  hardened/linux/amd64/selinux
  [11]  hardened/linux/amd64/no-multilib
  [12]  hardened/linux/amd64/no-multilib/selinux
  [13]  hardened/linux/amd64/x32
  [14]  hardened/linux/uclibc/amd64


And why should any profile affect an app's title bar text, which doesn't seem to me to be too likely (or at least that it should be, not that I know a lot about profiles), leading me to believe that maybe in this case ff "Private Window" functionality is broken.

Is there any way to determine whether the "private window" that is created in my case is actually a "private window", just without a proper designation?
(Or that the "private window" in _your_ case is actually a private window?)

I am not speeaking of portage tree profile, I am speaking of ~/.mozilla/firefox. You should see confirmation in the title bar just as in the screen shot.

Ah.  Ok, that works.

After going back to my original ff profile...

A little look into my ff config shows the "problem"...

Recently, I've generally been trying to button things down a bit more than in the past (never wide open) and recently in ff 'Preferences' -->  'Privacy'  -->  'History' had selected 'Never Remember History'.  If I change this to 'Remember History', I get 'New Private Window' with the proper title bar designation.

So, if you have 'Never Remember History' in your ff config shouldn't every ff window have '[Private Browsing]' in its title bar?

Thank you for your help.
