When I try to emerge openclipart with  USE="gzip png svg" it downloads a 324 MB huge File from 'http://de-mirror.org/distro/gentoo/distfiles/openclipart-0.19.tar.bz2' and http://download.openclipart.org/downloads/0.19/openclipart-0.19.tar.bz2.

It tries the mirror then the original site, so In fact it downloads more than 600 MB of Data to find out: 

('Filesize does not match recorded size', 340235637, 2585150)
!!! Fetched file: openclipart-0.19.tar.bz2 VERIFY FAILED!
!!! Reason: Filesize does not match recorded size
!!! Got:      340235637
!!! Expected: 2585150
Refetching... File renamed to '/usr/portage/distfiles/openclipart-0.19.tar.bz2._checksum_failure_.j4tzUC'





Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge openclipart
2. see your bandwith beeing wasted multiple times
3. watch a failing ebuild

Actual Results:  
huge chunks of temporary files

Expected Results:  
installed opencliparts

Thanks. Fixed. It was broken by ssuominen while moving from x11-misc to media-gfx.

@dev-portage:
Please have a look if this can be improved.

What do you portage want to do? To not try to download from the upstream servers if the file on the mirror is bad?

I don't expect anything, but guess I should have doublechecked my doublecheck it emerged fine.
