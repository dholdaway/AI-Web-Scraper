Description

This bug is really a nonsense, but it is a bit annoying.
When you use GTK+ installation through 2007.0 LiveCD, at the end, you can select to install syslog-ng and other system tools right before having to reboot to the newly installed system.

The problem is that this GTK+ program do an 'emerge' on the chroot to emerge slocate, vixie-cron, syslog-ng and other things if selected, but in world file, the /n character is missing in each line of this programs, causing a parser error next time you emerge anything.

Reproducible: Always

I just did a test install with 2007.0 and this works fine for me.
