build.log

I am on arm (Raspberry Pi 3) and the regular update from the installed version 2.50.7 to the next stable 2.54.3 as well as to 2.54.4. fail.

There is nothing suspicious like OOM in dmesg or journals.

Could you humour me and try with a shorter PORTAGE_TMPDIR?

Thanks for the fast reply.

Hehe... I've tried the default, without setting PORTAGE_TMPDIR.

Same error.

I did NOT solve this issue.

But I've managed to build librsvg on another similar ARM machine (and created a binpkg there and such).

So as the issue might be any arbitrary issue not related to librsvg directly, I permit myself to close this issue as WORKSFORME.
