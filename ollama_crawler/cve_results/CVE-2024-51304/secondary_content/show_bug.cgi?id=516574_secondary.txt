That'll be a bit of a problem,as I disected the tar ball and corrected the timestamps,redid the manifest file and the build completed successfully.
I put in the report mainly to notify anyone else that there is a hassle with this particular file,hoping that they will have the nouse to correct same.

I can't reproduce this at all so the problem never was in the tarball I guess.

Yeh been thinking that my machine time may have moved,though indicated time is correct on screen,strange that it only affected the one file downloaded,the other 15 or so were no hassle. Put it down to serendipity HIHI
