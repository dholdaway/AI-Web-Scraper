Description

I was trying to post a bug about a package that fails to build, but when I finished putting in all the information and hit "Submit", I get this error:

The file at https://bugs.gentoo.org/post_bug.cgi is not readable.

    It may have been removed, moved, or file permissions may be preventing access.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in to bugs.gentoo.org
2. Fill out bug report (in Gentoo Linux category)
3. Click "Submit"
Actual Results:  
Get an error saying https://bugs.gentoo.org/post_bug.cgi is not readable. Running a subsequent search for my bug report finds nothing.

Expected Results:  
Bug report submitted.

I tried both from firefox and qupzilla. Both gave me errors about post_bug.cgi

Bug 597088 shows it worked in the meantime which you surely could have noted here to spare us time investigating the issue.

Yes, after a bit of experimenting last night right before I went to bed, I did eventually get that other bug to post. And you're right, I should have immediately noted that here before nodding off. Anyway, it still didn't work when I tried it as before. 

What I did differently in the end was to run `cat /var/tmp/portage/.../build.log`, copy the output from my terminal and “paste text as attachment”. Initially, I had tried just to upload the file as an attachment (which the website's layout suggests would be the default workflow).

Checking back now, I see that the build.log file in /var/tmp/portage has its permissions as '-rw-rw---- 1 portage portage', so uploading as a normal user to the web I wouldn't have had read access to the file, and I can only assume that's what resulted in the failure.

Perhaps this should be documented somewhere, since the message from Portage after the failed build said to post the complete build log, and it was Portage that set the permissions on that file such that an attempted upload from a normal web-browsing (i.e. non-root) user would fail.
