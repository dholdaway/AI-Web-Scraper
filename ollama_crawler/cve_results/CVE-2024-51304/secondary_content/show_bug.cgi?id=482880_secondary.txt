Before the time the wiki was made translatable, it was an easy thing to make out if translated pages were synchronised with the English pages. 
But now, things have become increasingly more difficult as some English pages, newly moved to the wiki, are not made translatable preventing translated pages to be fully up to date.
This not only creates difficulties for the translator but also, put the reader in some sort of trouble, making him doubt whether the page he is reading is really reliable or not.
Could parts of the main documentation that are moved to the wiki be made translatable as soon as possible after the move ?

Reproducible: Always

You can mark the documents as translatable yourself if you feel that the documents are of decent enough quality. Some of the moved documents I didn't put the necessary translation tags in because I believe the documents need to be edited properly (language, style, content, etc.) before they are "qualitatively rich" enough for translations.

So if you do feel they're accurate enough to be translated, add in the <languages /> and <translate>..</translate> tags. The document will then show up in the list of requested translatable documents and I'll see to it that they are either marked as translatable, or will put my feedback in the Talk page about why I discouraged the translations for now.
