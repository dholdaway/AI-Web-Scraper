Description

udev-init-scripts is a gentoo hosted project and the listed homepage is www.gentoo.org, why isn't it listed as a bugzy component under the gentoo-hosted-projects product?  Oh, well, I guess given the lack the best fit is openrc, being primarily openrc scripts...

After seeing the new update to udev-init-scripts-26 available, as any reasonable sysadmin worried about the effect of a vital-package update, my question was what changed enough to bump the version?

Unfortunately I cannot find a proper changelog for the udev-init-scripts sources.  The package changelog has entirely opaque "version bump" entries, no details on what changed in the actual sources.  That'd be expected for a non-gentoo-hosted package, presumably with its own upstream changelogs, but...

The listed homepage is www.gentoo.org, which isn't much help in finding a package sources specific changelog, and (from what I could find when I looked) there's none in the tarball either. =:^(

Of course one could browse the git repo for it, or do what I do with openrc and run the live-9999 version in ordered to more closely follow changes, but unlike openrc (where I do just that, run 9999, and do an ebuild unpack at every system update, then if there's an update, run a git-whatchanged and see what's new), I don't have any particular desire to follow upstream udev-init-scripts /that/ closely, I just want a changelog to look at when a new version /does/ come out.

So please either create a sources changelog, or do what Zac does with portage, and put that info in the package changelog.

(The same request arguably applies to openrc, but as I explained above I run the live-9999 version of it and git-whatchanged is my changelog there.  But for others...)

(Turns out the udev-init-script changes were to a few paths, s/sbin/bin/ .  But I had the choice of either diffing the tarballs or digging thru the repo to find that out, when all I should have needed to do was check the sysadmin-visible changelog.)

Duncan (wearing my concerned sysadmin hat!)

Leaving the decision on what to do with this bug to our udev admins, you might get an overview of what has changed in the init scripts from this page:

The only thing that should be assigned to openrc@gentoo.org is bugs in
sys-apps/openrc.

Thanks,

William

we will try to put important information to the package's ChangeLog, if there isn't any then propably nothing user needs reacting for happened
