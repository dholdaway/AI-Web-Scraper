IIRC, you should rebuild sdl-image.

Did you follow revdep-rebuild instructions when updating from jpeg-7 to 8*?

No, how I can obtain them?

sdl-image is not installed on my system

Quote from emerge output when updating libjpeg:

Old versions of installed libraries were detected on your system.
In order to avoid breaking packages that depend on these old libs,
the libraries are not being removed.  You need to run revdep-rebuild
in order to remove these old dependencies.  If you do not have this
helper program, simply emerge the 'gentoolkit' package.

  # revdep-rebuild --library libjpeg.so.7

Once you've finished running revdep-rebuild, it should be safe to
delete the old libraries.  Here is a copy & paste for the lazy:
  # rm '/usr/lib64/libjpeg.so.7'

I deleted the library with 
rm '/usr/lib64/libjpeg.so.7'
and reemerge singularity, now it works with images.
