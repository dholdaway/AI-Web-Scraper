app-benchmark/jmeter-2.0.1-r1 needs jtidy as a dependency, and will not build without it.
After installing jtidy, jmeter installation went without problems

It installed just fine without jtidy here because it is using the bundled copy. That is tracked in bug #63309. Please attach the build.log and emerge --info as the die message should tell you to and reopen.

These are the packages that would be merged, in order:
