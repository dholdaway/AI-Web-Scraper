rync and webrsync complian about www-apps/freeradius-dialupadmin. The prob is that 
freeradius is misspelled and rsync is hunting for www-apps/freeradiuq-dialupadmin which doesnt exist.

Actual Results:  
readlink "/home/portage/www-apps/freeradiuq-dialupadmin" failed: No such file or
directory

Ok the prob turned to be a hichup of some sort on the drive. I forgot I was ssh into my sons HLDS sever when I recieved no errors. On the box that had the prob I'm useing xfs as the file system. This morning after realizing my goof up I figured that Id just " rm -r /home/portage/* " on the RIGHT box. It removed everything but webb-apps/freeradiuq-dialupadmin and ls couldnt stat it. So I rebooted to have the disk checked. No reports of anything during boot so I rm -r again and it worked. Then emerged synced to my internel server and all is fine.
