Description

When trying to install kde-base/okular-4.3.90 I got dependency error:

DepList additional requirements not met error:
  * In program paludis (--log-level silent --show-reasons summary --multitask) -i1 okular:
  * When performing install action from command line:
  * When executing install task:
  * When building dependency list:
  * When adding PackageDepSpec 'kde-base/okular':
  * When adding package 'kde-base/okular-4.3.90:4.4::kde':
  * When adding build dependencies as pre dependencies:
  * When adding PackageDepSpec '>=virtual/poppler-0.12.1[lcms]':
  * Error searching for '>=virtual/poppler-0.12.1[lcms]': additional requirements are not met on 'virtual/poppler-0.12.1:0::gentoo'

Unmet additional requirements are as follows:
    * Flag 'lcms' enabled

The problem is - the poppler ebuild in virtual category has no flag 'lcms' - only dev-libs/poppler have that flag.

As the result of that I have no possibility to correctly install okular and have correct dependencies.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Unmask KDE-4.3.90 from kde overlay
2. Try to install okular-4.3.90
3.

Actual Results:  
Dependency error on poppler

Expected Results:  
Correct installation without dependency mismatch

Huh?

[ebuild   R   ] virtual/poppler-0.12.1  USE="lcms" 0 kB

Not a kde bug, works under portage.

Sorry I see it's paludis related problem.

No it's not, it's a problem of mixing stable and unstable.
The current stable virtual-poppler does not have such a useflag.

This is a user error in the first place and an epic fail on the side of the gentoo devs in evaluating the bug report. There is no need to despise paludis.

There is no problem to reproduce this with portage either.

No it's not. There is a specific dependency on >=virtual/poppler-0.12.1[lcms] and this works with portage as intended.

> This is a user error in the first place

I am assuming that the user error here is failure to decipher the paludis output. It looks to me that the user needs to enable the lcms useflag.

You can't blame the Gentoo devs for pointing out that the ebuilds are correct and working as intended with portage.

> There is no need to despise paludis.

There always is.
