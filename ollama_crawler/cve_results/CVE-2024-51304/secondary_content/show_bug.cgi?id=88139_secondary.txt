My System does an automatic reboot while trying to mount the remaining filesystem (i.e. after all modules were loaded) With the next boot I will work fine. It seemed that it only happened after a clean shutdown on previous version, but with the current I am not that sure anymore... I seems to happen everytime

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Shutdown Computer (cleanly)
2. Boot
3.

Actual Results:  
Boot goes till "mounting remainig Filesystems" then reboots, the following
reboot works fine.

Expected Results:  
One clean boot

I had reiser4 installed for some time, and there this annoiance would happen;
since I switched back to reiserfs I cannot do a clean boot anymore

I am currently running on Nitro-Sources (which are not supported) but the same
happens with gentoo-sources; Ill double-check this issue with gentoo-sources!!

I can also confirm that the same happens on my home system (which I currently
cannot access): Duron 1GHz, 768MB Ram, pure testing (~x86).

IIRC this happened also on older versions of baselayout 1.11....

Update on my behalf:

I just checked it with a gentoo-kernel (2.6.11-r5)... To my surprise I would reboot cleanly on the first attempt, I reboot once more, to see whether this was just a coincidence; Booted fine. Then I installed some additional "kernel packages", rebooted and the error was back again. Unforunately I didn't emerged the one by one, but all at once, so I cannot tell which it is for sure.

The packages are: bcm570x, ipw2200, ati-drivers

As I mentioned before I am having the same problems on my desktop, neither use bmc570x nor ipw2200, but I use ati-drivers; therefore I guess there I a problem with ati-drivers.

Best Regards
Nico

The problem solved itself...
Probably because I added "0 1" to dump check to my home-dir partition...

Cheers
Nico
