I guess it's good for everyone if it's good for x86 and amd64.

bug 327605 has nothing to do with current stable afaik.  shadow was only stabilized because of the security bug 308047.

I was recently hit by stabilizing it on amd64.
With this version of shadow, samba NTML authentication doesn't work correctly. I've got plenty of errors like this:

Aug 02 09:06:51 [ntlm_auth] [2010/08/02 09:06:51,  0] utils/ntlm_auth.c:558(winbind_pw_check)_
Aug 02 09:06:51 [ntlm_auth] Login for user [AD]\[james.dunn]@[JAMESD] failed due to [winbind client not authorized to use winbindd_pam_auth_crap. Ensure permissions on /var/cache/samba/winbindd_privileged are set correctly.]_
Aug 02 09:06:51 [ntlm_auth] [2010/08/02 09:06:51,  0] utils/ntlm_auth.c:833(manage_squid_ntlmssp_request)_
Aug 02 09:06:51 [ntlm_auth] NTLMSSP BH: NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED_

Downgrading to 4.1.2.2 fixes all problems.

Not sure if that's a blocker for stable, but quite annoying for sure.

Uhm is that authenticating local users against Samba or Samba users against local auth? In both case most likely this is a bug for pam-bugs@g.o, but the latter sounds definitely fishy.
