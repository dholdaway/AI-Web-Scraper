Description

When installing smokeping (tested with 2.2.4), the "cropper" files were installed into the perl directory. However, these files should be located in the htdocs. I just checked all the ebuilds in the portage tree and only the latest masked version has an elog message indicating that the files need to be moved or symlinked. This message does not exist in 2.2.4 or 2.3.5.

PS. I don't suppose there's an easier way to do it in the ebuild right off the bat? It'll be one less thing to worry about and makes reinstallation or uninstallation much more complete.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge smokeping
2. /etc/init.d/apache2 reload (or restart)
3. Visit /cgi-perl/smokeping.pl on the browser

Actual Results:  
Cropper doesn't work. Several message in the error_log file indicate multiple "client denied by server configuration" messages.

Expected Results:  
No error, or at least warn us that we have to perform extra necessary steps.

Thank you for report. I'm not sure if pushing additional files into htdocs is a good idea... People that don't want cropper will have to remember to remove it after each upgrade/reinstall. Marking this bug as WORKSFORME since we close bugs as soon as they are fixed in ~arch. I hope to fix other problems with smokeping 2.4.2 and mark it stable as soon as possible.
