Just tried to update my chroot and the checks ebuild fails (The source compiles it seems but afterwards it fails in one of the other steps). Build.log attached.

Maybe this is relevant?

/var/tmp/portage/dev-libs/check-0.9.11/work/check-0.9.11/build-aux/missing: line 81:  4342 Segmentation fault      "$@"

Yeah, it's the following command that's failing, because the "missing" executable segfaults:

  ...
  if (/bin/sh /var/tmp/portage/dev-libs/check-0.9.11/work/check-0.9.11/build-aux/missing makeinfo --version) >/dev/null 2>&1; then \
  ...

I'm not familiar with what it's trying to do there, so let's try the easy thing first. Can you keyword dev-libs/check-0.10.0-r1 and see if that version works better? If it does, we can simply stabilize it over the one that's causing you problems.

So I opened up my chroot again and instead of doing: emerge -uDNav @world, I did a emerge -1a check, and now 0.9.11 installed.. I haven't changed anything in the chroot since this happened. I have however restarted my server a few times. Weird.

I also keyworded 0.10.0-r1 to see if that works and that did as well. But I don't really know if this one fixed the issue considering my 0.9.11 magically fixed itself. If you want, you can leave this bug in a monitoring state and see if anyone else reports a problem.

Weird, OK. If you experience any other unusual segfaults, you may want to try memtest -- bad RAM is notorious for causing segmentation faults during emerge. But it could also just be that some library needed to be rebuilt and it will never happen again.

If I find this bug in a few months and no one else has reported the same issue, I'll close it then.

I haven't noticed any segfaults happening in other places, but will keep that in mind since who knows after many years, the ram might start to be going bad. Thanks!

we are stabilizing the newer version anyway... then, please move to that one and report if you find a similar issue in the future
