sys-fs/udev-240-r2 still produces the same bug as https://bugs.gentoo.org/673796 which was marked as fixed.

Please create a bug report upstream.

I can confirm that udev-240-r2 creates improper 660 permissions on /dev/null, /dev/urandom, and the like.  I am not using lvm2, so this problem doesn't prevent booting for me, but it is annoying to have to change permissions after each reboot.  Unkeywording udev backs off to udev-239, which fixes the problem for me.

gentoo-sources 4.20.3
openrc 0.40.3
udisks 2.8.1

As an alternative to having sys-fs/udev, I am using sys-fs/eudev now. Works lika a charm

As another workaround please test lvm2-2.02.184-r1.
