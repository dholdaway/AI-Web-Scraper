When changing a color in the configuredialog and applying that change, only the
middle piece (between before and after) is redrawn.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Konsole.
2. Create a directory and cd into it.
3. Create the empty file empty.cc
4. Create the file prov.cc with some content like this:
float calculate_something(float const a, float const b, float const c) {
   return
      calculate_something(1.7, calculate_something(8.9, 19.51, 33.0), a) +
      calculate_something(c, 18.8, calculate_something(7.5, b, a));
}
5. Execute "diff -u empty.cc prov.cc|kompare -".
6. Open the settings dialog and change the background color of added blocks.
7. Press Apply.

Actual Results:  
Only the middle part is redrawn (see attached screenshot).

Expected Results:  
Also the before and after parts are redrawn.

The change does take effect if font is also changed before Apply is pressed, or
the configuredialog is closed (OK or Cancel).

How about kde-4.5.4?

First few times, I could not reproduce it with current versions of packages, but then it happened again. Seems like it might need a few tries. Now I saw a different problem in addition. The middle part is not filled to the curve, but to a straight line. Maybe that has something to do with switching graphic driver from nv to nouveau?

Have you tried kde-4.6? 

No news on upstream bug report unfortunately...

No news on the upstream bug- could you please recheck if this still occurs with 4.7.2?
