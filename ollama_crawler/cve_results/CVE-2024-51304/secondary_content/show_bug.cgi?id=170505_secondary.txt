Description

I have attached a working ebuild that compiles and installs a working GTK and QT version of 0.47, based on the 0.46.2 that was in sunrise some time back.

This really should not have been removed from the ebuild, as one of the whole things about qtcurve is that it allows GTK and QT apps to look the same!

Reproducible: Always

/me points to x11-themes/gtk-engines-qtcurve and closes the bug.

OK, thats fair enough - maybe that should have been mentioned somewhere when emerging the update to qtcurve from older versions - I wasn't aware until you pointed me to it from this bug which really isn't on.
