I am fairly new to Linux and sometimes have trouble setting Gentoo up on computers that I did not put together myself.  You might consider adding a footnote about using dmesg or equivalent service to get a listing of the detected hardware in the system which could be used when manually adding modules to load at boot.

Okay, yes, 'dmesg' will sometimes contain information about what's been detected in a computer -- and there are also tools like 'lspci' that can also give you hints as to what's installed.... although nothing beats pulling the thing apart and doing some visual inspection. :-)

However, this is really not within the scope of the Gentoo Handbook.  Yes, it's a neat little feature -- but it's got very little with installing Gentoo.  This would be better in a separate "tips and tricks" document if one exists.

We already have the following paragraph in our documentation for the manual kernel configuration part:

"""
However, one thing is true: you must know your system when you start configuring a kernel manually. Most information can be gathered by viewing the contents of /proc/pci (or by using lspci if available). You can also run lsmod to see what kernel modules the LiveCD uses (it might provide you with a nice hint on what to enable).
"""

That should be more than enough - there are far better guides on kernel configuration and system maintenance elsewhere.
