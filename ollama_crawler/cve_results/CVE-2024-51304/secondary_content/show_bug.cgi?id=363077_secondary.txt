emerge --info

Building ffmpeg and libvpx both get stuck. nasm and yasm consume 100% CPU and do not finish for hours.

conftest.asm

Trying to build this with "nasm conftest.asm" never finishes, and consumes 100% CPU. The last system call is 'open("conftest.asm", O_RDONLY) = 4', according to strace.

this seems to work with:

% qlist -Iv nasm yasm
dev-lang/nasm-2.10.01
dev-lang/yasm-1.2.0
