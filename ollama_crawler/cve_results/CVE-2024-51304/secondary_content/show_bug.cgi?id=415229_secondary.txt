Created attachment 311235 [details]
sample guide "gentoo-fbsd-install.xml"

Now, new stage3 file for Gentoo/FreeBSD 9.0 is now available (1).
This guide will support the installation using the recent 9.0 stage3.
Of course, both x86-fbsd and amd64-fbsd.

i'd prefer that the existing gentoo/fbsd guide was updated:

http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gentoo-freebsd.xml

that being said, the proposed draft in its current form (and english) is more suited to wiki.gentoo.org than the regular documentation.

Thank you for your comment.

I made a new page in the Wiki.
because it can be easily updated.
