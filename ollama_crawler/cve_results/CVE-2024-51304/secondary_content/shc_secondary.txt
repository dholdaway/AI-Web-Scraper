 Inside Sotera Health Co's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
If we incorrectly anticipate these factors, or unexpected events occur, our operating results could be materially affected.



 Other - Other   Highlight
Changes in our judgment related to the assessment of uncertain tax positions could materially impact our results of operations.

 Other - Other   Highlight
The application of accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
The volume decline stemmed mainly from a decline in demand for industrial-use Co-60 compared to the prior year.

 Financial - Debt   Highlight
The Senior Secured Credit Facilities and 2023 Credit Agreement contain additional covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to engage in certain activities, such as incur indebtedness or permit to exist any lien on any property or asset now owned or hereafter acquired, as specified in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and 2023 Credit Agreement.
