emerge --info

I'm using kde-meta 4.11.2-r1 and shutdown/restart/logoff not working to my system.
I to run dbus message: qdbus org.kde.ksmserver /KSMServer logout 0 0 0, but it not affected to log.

If I pressed to power button on kde widget in .xsession-errors log I see this message:
plasma-desktop(3096)/kdecore (KConfigSkeleton) KCoreConfigSkeleton::writeConfig:
and nothing, no popup windows, error messages, etc.

I rebuild dbus, upower and other.

Please don't change the priority of a bug. This is by no means a critical issue.
