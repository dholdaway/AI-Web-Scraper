If you install Gentoo by the handbook and set up locales as described in chapter 6b, section "Optional: glibc Locales", the locales would be configured, but the system would be set to POSIX locale. That causes some programs dealing with non-ASCII texts to behave weirdly or display garbage or nothing without a clear error message.

The section "Optional: glibc Locales" should explicitly tell that the user has to issue a command 

eselect locale list

to display available locales and

eselect locale set <target>

to set the desired locale.

Observed for AMD64, but seems to be the same for all platforms.

Well, there's a bug open as well for marking the locale selection less optional, but I'm not sure if this is the same. When I run eselect, it only talks about the LANG variable. Is this all it will change, and don't we want to stick with "C" as the default?

agreed with swift's assessment -- also, i haven't had any such issues with POSIX or UTF8 locales. since it only affects LANG, not every possible locale category, i don't think it's necessary to mention it at this point. we do have that other bug for locale selection, so any related stuff can be take care of through it.
