I started as user (not root)

 $ java-config -l

And got output:

 Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "/usr/bin/java-config-2", line 8, in <module>
     from java_config_2 import __version__
 ImportError: No module named java_config_2

I have isntalled these java related packages:

$ qlist -I | grep java
dev-java/ant
dev-java/ant-core
dev-java/jai-bin
dev-java/java-config
dev-java/java-config
dev-java/java-config-wrapper
dev-java/sun-jai-bin
dev-java/sun-jce-bin


Reproducible: Always

re-emerge java-config after your python upgrade to make it work again
See bug 230703

this work around works

I confirm this fix (reemerging java-config after python update) as working. Although it probably would have been more user friendly to include java-config in the dependencies to make it emerge before any java stuff in this case.

There's a reason that Python tells you to run python-updater... ;]

The workaround works, but the python-updater command does not re-emerge java-config (form me).
emerge -1 java-config and it's ok.

exactly. I just encountered the same problem (couldn't run freemind after a Python upgrade).

I ran python-updater, it re-emerged a lot of stuff, but apparently not java-config.

the proposed solution works fine, however.

Same problem for me, python-updater didn't get it.  Had to re-emerge it myself.
