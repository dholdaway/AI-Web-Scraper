Please keyword dev-db/mysql-4.0.27 stable on ~arm ~mips ~s390 ~sh, 4.0.27 fixes various security issues and will finally enable us to drop the 4.0.25 ebuild, which is the only one using the old ebuild structure, and thus easying the maintainance of dev-db/mysql.
Best regards, CHTEKK.

This is really becoming a problem... We have a known broken, hardly maintainable and ridden with security bugs ebuild in the tree, and there's nothing done about it... You have time till Friday, 27th October 2006, to either keyword it, drop your keywords, whatever, after that the MySQL Team will take action to get rid of mysql-4.0.25* ebuild...
Best regards, CHTEKK.

It's not hurting you just sitting there doing nothing.

It does not very much but a bit more than nothing, bugs have been opened regarding that  ebuild.

On the other hand both me and CHTEKK are hurted to only _see_ it there. Both we have put an effort in making the eclass a stable and viable alternative to the ebuild. 

If it's _really_ required a 4.0.25 ebuild we can add an eclass driven there.
Either bumping or not the revision. As you (ARCHs) prefere.

The ebuild will vanish, the current prevision is to mark 4.0.27 stable for arm, mips, s390, sh  archs.

sincerely, Francesco

Us? Indirectly... We don't posses any systems that use those arches, but we have to maintain it and eventually go and fix bugs etc. that get assigned to that ebuild...
But whom it really hurts are, as always, the users of those arches... There is 4.1.21 that's stable for all those arches, so either tell us that you only want to support 4.1 and up, so we can remove the keywords from .25 and remove the ebuild, or go and keyword .27... The security bug was over 4 months ago iirc, if not more, this bug is open since 3 weeks, and no one cares from the arch teams, so it should be no problem to just tell us "we don't care about 4.0 mysql, you can remove our keywords and the .25 ebuild", or go, emerge it, and let the tests run over it?
Best regards, CHTEKK.

In my experience three weeks is nothing for architectures, which are used only by a very minor share of devs. Security-wise you don't have to care though, Luca. Non of these archs is supported.

Sometimes you need to clean up to perform a change in package handling or to make sure some important fixes reach everyone - both for the users as well as for you not accumulating dupes on bugs. Arch teams laying behind can be demotivating.
