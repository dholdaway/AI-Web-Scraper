Searched google for many days for this issue, but could not find a "good"answer.
Posted here for helping others.


While trying to update an old Gentoo installation, I had a hard-time installing  pygtk(used by git). In the end, I have managed after installing the latest cairomm.


If one builds the dependency graph for pygtk (equery depgraph pygtk) cairomm appears as dependency for gtkmm only! and gtkmm is NOT installed on my system. 
Thus, I think pygtk depends on cairomm (and maybe other packages) and the ebuilds should be updated. 

Best regards,
Octavian

Nope, pygtk doesn't need any of the mm (C++) bindings. 
If you still believe there is a bug somewhere, post actual build.log from pygtk with the failure as well as emerge --info.

That would be difficult. The cairomm ebuilds are no longer available and I did not save any info. I didn't do that since I was not sure that cairomm would actually fix it. In fact I reinstalled cairomm since dev-cpp/gtkmm was also failing and I looked at the dependencies in the dev-cpp/gtkmm ebuild. 

I have spent so much time with it (revdep-rebuild, python-updater, perl-cleaner) but nothing helped. So, I was happy when this was solved and I quickly moved to the update of the system. 

I propose to close the bug. If somebody else is haunted by the same pygtk issue, he/she can reopen the bug and provide additional info...
