Description

I have several lvm2 volumes (on top of raid), and when I do a shutdown I get and
error about the init scipt cannot find xargs.
The bug is in /lib/rcscripts/addons/lvm-stop.sh
I think the reason for this is that xargs is used in the script, but xargs is
locates in /usr/bin and /usr is on a lvm volume. So this volume if first
unmounted  and the this script tries to shut it down (hence it cannot find xargs
since it's located on an unmounted volume).
My machine is an amd64 but I don't think this has anything to do with it.
The fault occured in the new 1.11.12(-r1) baselyout.

Why no revision bump? This bug is really annoying and for most users it doesn't
get fixed until a revision bump. I also didn't see anything in the Changelog.
