Description


Henry





          2008-10-02 22:41:33 UTC
        

When attempting to install app-crypt/gpgme-1.1.6, the emerge failed when gpgsm could not import 3 keys due to an unknown hash algorithm.

FIX:  update dev-libs/libgcrypt.  I'm not sure what the minimum version required is, though dev-libs/libgcrypt-1.4.0-r1 does the trick.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have a version of libgcrypt around 1.2.x. emerged (not slotted)
2.emerge =app-crypt/gpgme-1.1.6


Actual Results:  
The ebuild failed, as expected, with the expected error.

Expected Results:  
The ebuild should have succeeded.

gpgsm belongs to app-crypt/gnupg.
app-crypt/gpgme already depends on app-crypt/gnupg.
app-crypt/gpgme doesn't directly use dev-libs/libgcrypt (gpgme libraries aren't linked against libgcrypt libraries), so app-crypt/gpgme shouldn't depend on dev-libs/libgcrypt.

agree with Arfrever. dev-libs/libgcrypt-1.4.0-r1 has been stable for a long time too (bug 206666)

I can confirm this bug exactly as written, and I am grateful to the OP, because I was about to re-emerge my whole system.  However, when I emerged libgcrypt it pulled in 3 other updates. They were:

1)automake (obviously I already had this installed, but it must have updated it.  I suspect that this is the real culpret)

2)gettext

3)libgpg-error (not sure if this was already installed or not.. didn't pay attention)

So it is not clear, to me at least, that is is from libgcrypt or not.  Maybe the OP was more careful to only update one thing at a time and may know this.  At any rate, there is definitely some truth to this bug.
