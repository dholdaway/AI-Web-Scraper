Not sure what you mean. The kernel-2.6.13-2.6.16-layer7-2.2.patch patch applied cleanly to 2.6.17 so there isn't a problem that I can see.

The authors could hardly know how many versions it would be compatible so labeling the patch kernel-2.6.13-2.6.142-layer7-2.2.patch would be a bit foolish.

Please reopen if you have troubles with this patch, and if so give your current kernel type.
