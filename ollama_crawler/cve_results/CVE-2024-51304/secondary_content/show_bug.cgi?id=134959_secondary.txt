I've done a few emerge sync's to try and take care of it, but 

!!! Digest verification Failed:
!!!    /usr/portage/sys-apps/shadow/shadow-4.0.15-r2.ebuild
!!! Reason: Filesize does not match recorded size


Seeing as how (to get to this point) many people have unmerged pam-login, I would think it's important to fix this.

Oh, and this is the 3rd digest verification failure I've seen in as many days.

Confirmed. Re-syncing now.

A sync with http://bugs.gentoo.org/131396 fixed it.
