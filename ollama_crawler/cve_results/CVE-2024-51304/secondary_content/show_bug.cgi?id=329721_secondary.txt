gcc-config should not allow unsupported gcc versions to be selected for the system.

Since gcc-3.4* can no longer be used (see http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=325269), they should no longer be selectable.

# gcc-config -l
 [1] i686-pc-linux-gnu-3.4.6 *
 [2] i686-pc-linux-gnu-3.4.6-hardened
 [3] i686-pc-linux-gnu-3.4.6-hardenednopie
 [4] i686-pc-linux-gnu-3.4.6-hardenednopiessp
 [5] i686-pc-linux-gnu-3.4.6-hardenednossp
 [6] i686-pc-linux-gnu-4.3.4
 [7] i686-pc-linux-gnu-4.4.3

gcc-3.4.6 is still supported, and should stay selectable as long as gcc:3.4

The bug you refer to does not prove that gcc:3.4 is unsupported by Gentoo developers nor by portage, but that their is no assurance that newly bumped packages will still compile with gcc:3.4.

Please resolve as INVALID.

the minimum supported toolchain is gcc-4.3 at the moment, and after some time, gcc-4.4. that's how it has always worked (support for old toolchain goes away in steps). there's no reason to force anyones hand by such gcc-config change.
