while trying to emerge app-text/pdftk-1.12 I ran into the following problem

The package declares a dependency on gcc-3.3, but in fact it needs gcj (the Java compiler)
This is not found on my gcc3

Reproducible: Always

!!! Relying on the shell to locate gcc, this may break
!!! DISTCC, installing gcc-config and setting your current gcc

Also Applies to x86.

gives error 

 * It seems that your system doesn't provides a Java compiler.
 * Re-emerge sys-devel/gcc with "gcj" enabled.

can ebuild be made to check if correct use flag for gcc is present when built?

Joe, please file a new bug.  It should be "trivial" using $(build_with_use ...).  This bug is for OSX.  Thanks.

recycling this bug.  The owners of this package should consider changing the dependency and making a more proper check for the existence of gcj.

Not much OSX can do here.

The check looks correct to me. gcc-3 in portage offers gcj. An alternative is to look in the java-gcj overlay for a better gcj :-)
