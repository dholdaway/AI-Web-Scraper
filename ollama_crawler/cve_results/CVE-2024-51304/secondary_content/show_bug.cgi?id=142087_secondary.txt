Description


Frank Lomax

/usr/bin/xml2po is part of gnome-doc-utils.  The first line of this script says

#!/usr/local/bin/python

This is broken because the system may have a /usr/local/bin/python that is not controlled by Gentoo and does not have libxml2 installed.  Instead the #! line should use /usr/bin/python to ensure that the Gentoo controlled Python installation is used.
