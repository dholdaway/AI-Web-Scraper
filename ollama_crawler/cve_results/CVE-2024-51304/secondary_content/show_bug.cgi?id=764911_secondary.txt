I can't reproduce. But I suspect, since it's a segmentation fault, that this could be related to a higher cpu count.

Could you rerun with MAKEOPTS="-j1"?

Thanks!

I will close here now. Still unable to reproduce. Tried now on multiple gentoo machines. It just works. The only difference is, I don't have such high cpu count.
