I need to manually start udev-trigger every time i boot my Gentoo system for any mouse or keyboard to be detected by xorg. The script is added to the sysinit runlevel but not started on boot and I can't see any error messages when booting. 

$ rc-config show all 
...
Status of init scripts in runlevel "sysinit"
  cgroups                   [stopped]
  devfs                     [started]
  dmesg                     [stopped]
  kmod-static-nodes         [stopped]
  opentmpfiles-dev          [stopped]
  sysfs                     [started]
  udev                      [started]
  udev-trigger              [stopped]

$ rc-update add /etc/init.d/udev-trigger sysinit
 * rc-update: /etc/init.d/udev-trigger already installed in runlevel `sysinit'; skipping

Since rc-config shows that udev-trigger is added to the runlevel I would expect it to start automatically but it doesn't seem to do that.

which package do you think causes the problem?

I don't have an idea of what might cause this behavior. There are, as far as I can see, no errors when I boot. But I'd be happy to help out and troubleshoot if someone can point me in the right direction.

I see. The situation seems to be a bit more complicate and requires some analysis.
We can not help you efficiently via bug tracker. The bug tracker aims rather on specific problems in .ebuilds and less on individual systems. 

I have had very good experience on the gentoo IRC [1] with questions like this. Of course there are also forums and mailing lists [2,3].
I hope you understand, that I will close the bug here therefore and wish you good luck on one of the mentioned channels [4].
Please reopen the ticket in order to provide an indication for an specific error in an ebuild or any gentoo related product.

In case anyone come here with same issue, this was apparently caused by /run having wrong permissions (should be 0755, not like /tmp's 1777).

If in doubt, just don't set an fstab line for /run as most init systems handle it themselves.
