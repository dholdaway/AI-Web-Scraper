After doing emerge-webrsync (today-11/17/2005) and performing emerge --update
world --deep and restarting system (I did not see, what was written during
GRUB's installation), after booting from ntldr (WinXP) residing in MBR into
/dev/hda4 (ext2 - gentoo's boot part), a word GRUB appears on screen and system
halts

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Get GRUB 0.97-r2
2.Restart your system

I can access all my gentoo partitions and files via Windows OS, thus you can
freely ask me for any supplemential info.

you prob have to install grub to your mbr and /boot yourself

do the normal 'root / setup' stuff from `grub` as you did when first
installing Gentoo and see if that fixes things

But everything worked fine before as not in mbr. I'd like a backwards
compatibility. Thanks.

no idea what you're talking about

did resetting the mbr/stage files work or not ?

It looks like new grub has rewritten /dev/hda4 boot record, and thus I forgot to
dd it into c:\gentoo.sec..
However, GRUB booted ONLY after I did additional grub> setup (hd0,3)
(grub-install /dev/hda4 didn't work, complaining about some missing /proc/usb
devices (this was on a chrooted fs, as installation manual told)) and dding a
fresh gentoo.sec (the one, which was generated by former emerge was corrupted).
Thus, sorry to bother you, as everything works now, it just remains as FYI..
