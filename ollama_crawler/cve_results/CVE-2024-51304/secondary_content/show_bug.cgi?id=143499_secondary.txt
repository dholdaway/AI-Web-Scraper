Description


Erik Quaeghebeur

I've got a stable amd64 system with kde-3.5.2. The recently marked stable pmount-0.9.9 does _not_ work, i.e., in kde I can't automatically mount my usb-storage devices (nicely detected by dbus/hal). Downgrading to pmount-0.9.6 resolves things.

The error message cited in the resulting error dialog:

mount: can't find /dev/sdb1 in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab

I know I'm light on info (and the above error tells next to nothing), but just tell me what steps I should take to diagnose the issue so we can fix it.

I'm going to close this bug, as the problem has disapeared after moving to gcc 4.1.1
