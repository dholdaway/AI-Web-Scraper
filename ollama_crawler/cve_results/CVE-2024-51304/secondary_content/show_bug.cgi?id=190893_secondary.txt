Well, that's what you get for moving /root to stupid places; don't do this and you won't have any such problem. Or create the directories manually if you insist on doing such things.

I moved root's home back to /root, but the problem is still. Help.

that's strange because gnome-media-2.18.0 and -r1 do have 

    addpredict "/root/.gconfd"
    addpredict "/root/.gconf"

which should cover your problem.

The problem is still what exactly? Post the exact errors.

Similar as comment #1, but not the  /home/root, just /root. 
I can paste it, but i feel it's unneccessary.

And do the directories exist - i.e., /root/.{gconf,gconfd,gnome2}? We'd need addwrite instead of addpredict for /root/.gconfd at least if they don't. If someone really insists on moving /root to crazy locations, we'd need 

addpredict "$(unset HOME; echo ~)/.gconf"
addpredict "$(unset HOME; echo ~)/.gconfd"

instead; and same for gnome2.eclass, it'd need addwrite "$(unset HOME; echo ~)/.gnome2" but I really don't think supporting this is needed.
