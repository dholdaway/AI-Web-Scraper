Description

When psh runs from Konsole or agetty as a login shell and recieves a TERM, it waits until enter is pressed, and only then handles it. The problem does not occur when used from a regular tty. In both cases, when TERM is finally handled, the history is updated properly and the exit is OK.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open psh as a Konsole task (not invoked from another shell), e.g. with konsole -e psh
2. click the X to close the window. wait for the error box and press cancel.
3. now click the X again, and press enter immediately.
4. try 2-3 by right-clicking and choosing 'Send Signal' -> 'TERM'
5. login in text mode when psh is your home shell
6, send psh a TERM from some other shell.
7. go back to the psh you tried to terminate, and press enter. 
Actual Results:  
step 2 will fail to terminate psh.
step 3 will terminate OK after <enter>.
same for 4,
step 7 shows same behaveiour in text console.

Expected Results:  
TERM should be handled immediately.

It seems that Control-C waits as well.

Oops, I erred in the description: the problem *does too* occur in a regular tty

I can't duplicate on psh-1.8, please re-open if this is still a problem.
