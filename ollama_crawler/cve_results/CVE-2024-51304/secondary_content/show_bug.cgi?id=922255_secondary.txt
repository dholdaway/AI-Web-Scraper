Description

I'm curious how people feel about adding pkgconf as  BDEPEND. I'm trying to remove `pkgconf` from my [implicit-system](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/overlays/chromiumos-overlay/+/refs/heads/main/virtual/target-sdk-implicit-system/target-sdk-implicit-system-9999.ebuild#71) because not all ebuilds use it. Would Gentoo be receptive of patches that add pkgconf as a BDEPEND?

Reproducible: Always

Sorry, what? Adding pkgconf as a BDEPEND to which package?

In general, any package which makes use of pkg-config and doesn't have a BDEPEND on virtual/pkgconfig is probably broken? Does it build from a minimal system that has been depcleaned --with-bdeps=n and re-emerged?

Keep in mind it's also an RDEPEND for cmake and meson.

Packages needing pkgconf are likely calling pkg-config instead (or should), and should BDEPEND on virtual/pkgconfig.

Right, Gentoo ebuilds should already be putting virtual/pkgconfig in BDEPEND when necessary.

Please do file bugs and/or send patches if there are cases where it is missing.

Sorry, I should have checked if existing ebuilds had it. Thanks for the confirmation! I'll send some patches.
