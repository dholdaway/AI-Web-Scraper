Linux Dangling PFN Mapping / Use-After-Free
Posted Oct 22, 2024
Authored by Jann Horn, Google Security Research, Seth Jenkins
An error path in usbdev_mmap() (where remap_pfn_range() fails midway through) frees pages before the PFN mapping pointing to those pages is cleaned up, making physical page use-after-free possible. Some other drivers look like they might have similar issues.

msm 5.15 Arbitrary Kernel Address Access
Posted Oct 15, 2024
Authored by Google Security Research, Seth Jenkins
This bug was found in msm-5.15 using tag KERNEL.PLATFORM.2.1.r1-05400-kernel.0. The fastrpc_file struct contains a flag, is_compat, that is set if the 32-bit compat_ioctl vfs handler is ever called on a fastrpc file (e.g. by opening and ioctling on /dev/adsprpc-smd). This flag is later used inside of e.g. fastrpc_internal_invoke2's macro invocations of K_COPY_FROM_USER to make decisions about whether the provided pointer is a userland pointer or a kernel-land pointer. However, because the state for making this K_COPY_FROM_USER decision is stored within the broadly accessible fastrpc_file struct instead of stored per ioctl invocation, this means that 64-bit ioctl invocations of fastrpc_internal_invoke2 will use userland provided addresses as kernel pointers if the 32-bit ioctl interface of the same fastrpc_file was ever previously invoked. This leads directly to attacker-controlled reads of arbitrary kernel addresses.
