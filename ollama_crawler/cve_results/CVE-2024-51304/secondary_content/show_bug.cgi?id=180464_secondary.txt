Description

Hi, 

I think it would be useful to have the option to search the names of packages contained in layman overlays. 

At the moment, we can't simply check if an ebuild is avaible somewhere, but have to search the web, and so Gentoo seems fragmented to me (could be just me, though). 

I just crave for a way to search all possible layman overlays without having to add them first. 

I don't know how that can be realized, though. 

Best wishes, 
Arne
