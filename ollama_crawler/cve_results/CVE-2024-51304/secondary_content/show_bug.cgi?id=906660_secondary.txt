That's odd.
I used this to install conky successfully a couple of days ago:

```
conky --version
conky 1.19.2 compiled 2023-05-17 for Linux x86_64
```

And as a test I now did it again:

```
conky --version
conky 1.19.2 compiled 2023-05-19 for Linux x86_64
```

Looks like it fetches the sources quite fine for me?

Can not reproduce either. Deleted the sources and recreated the manifest. It already fetches from the mirrors now!

Looks like github was down at the time or similar.
