On ppc Control+G has two bindings here:
"Continue search" and "Goto page".
Too bad, if I want to continue current search only "Goto page" appears.

The global default for "continue search" is <F3>. I suppose you have changed the default and experience conflicts because of it or something else went wrong.

You can change the global defaults via kcontrol-> regional preferences & accessibility -> shortcuts or locally for KPDF via Preferences -> configure shortcuts


Not an issue here.

I see, it was only an issue for the setup "Mac-Design".
"kde-standard for 3 special key" works for iBook.

thanks.
