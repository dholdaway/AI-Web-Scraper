Due to the missing libexpat.so.0 expat can't start. Using a simple symlink, it works again. Probably something that should get into the ebuild?

Erm, it works just fine here... Anyway -symlink is no way an option here, run revdep-rebuild.

$ ldd /opt/RealPlayer/realplay.bin | grep expat
        libexpat.so.1 => /usr/lib/libexpat.so.1 (0xb763d000)
$ emerge  -pv expat

These are the packages that would be merged, in order:

Calculating dependencies... done!
[ebuild   R   ] dev-libs/expat-2.0.0  0 kB

skinkie@tv ~ $ ldd /opt/RealPlayer/realplay.bin | grep expat
        libexpat.so.0 => not found
        libexpat.so.0 => not found

I'm looking at that one. Currently in the revdep-rebuild process.

(typo in my first message expat should be realplay)

You should remove the symlink first, otherwise it won't fix anything.
