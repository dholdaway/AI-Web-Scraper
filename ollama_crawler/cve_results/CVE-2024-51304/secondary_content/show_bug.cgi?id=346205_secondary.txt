Portage should have the ability to chroot into a separate Gentoo installation. By chrooting I mean portage will read the configs and package database from the guest Gentoo system instead of the host's. However everything else that portage uses itself (like libraries, the python interpreter etc...) will be take from the host.

This way it'll be possible to modify a system which's based on arch like arm, powerpc etc... Thus utilizing the processing power of a system which cannot chroot into the guest (the biggest e.g x86_64 guest and x86 host).

Reproducible: Always
