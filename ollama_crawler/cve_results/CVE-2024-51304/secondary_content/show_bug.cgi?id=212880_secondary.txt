Problem appears to be this line:
	( emake external-all && emake LT_LDFLAGS="-L${D}/usr/$(get_libdir)" local-all ) || die "Compilation of ${PN} failed"

It seems to build OK without the LT_LDFLAGS stuff.

Reopen with emerge --info and complete emerge log attached; this has been in the ebuild for months without anyone having such issues.

Don't see what this has to do with java. Add as us back if you can tell.

Do you still have this problem with Subversion 1.5.*?
