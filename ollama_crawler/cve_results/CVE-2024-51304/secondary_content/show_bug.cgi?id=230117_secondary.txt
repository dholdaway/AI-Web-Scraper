well without the output there is nothing we can do since it works here. If it's a new install but it has internet access, try installing wgetpaste to get the output out and then attach it here (the file, not the link).

We would also need to know which media you are using to install the machine and emerge --info obviously.

hum it appears that the patch is getting rejected but there really is no reason as there is no arch/profile/whatever specific code in the ebuild before applying the patch. The ebuild is applying the patch in src_compile for no good reason so I'll have to fix that anyway but I still can't see where the problem is coming from. Could you attach the unpatched Makefile.am from the libglade you have ?
