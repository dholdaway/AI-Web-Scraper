Release Notes Published

Active Support

Handle nil backtrace_locations in ActiveSupport::SyntaxErrorProxy.
Eugene Kenny
Fix ActiveSupport::JSON.encode to prevent duplicate keys.
If the same key exist in both String and Symbol form it could
lead to the same key being emitted twice.
Manish Sharma
Fix ActiveSupport::Cache::Store#read_multi when using a cache namespace
and local cache strategy.
Mark Oleson
Fix Time.now/DateTime.now/Date.today to return results in a system timezone after #travel_to.
There is a bug in the current implementation of #travel_to:
it remembers a timezone of its argument, and all stubbed methods start
returning results in that remembered timezone. However, the expected
behaviour is to return results in a system timezone.
Aleksei Chernenkov
Fix :unless_exist option for MemoryStore#write (et al) when using a
cache namespace.
S. Brent Faulkner
Fix ActiveSupport::Deprecation to handle blaming generated code.
Jean Boussier, fatkodima

Active Model

  No changes.

Active Record

Fix Migrations with versions older than 7.1 validating options given to
add_reference.
Hartley McGuire
Ensure reload sets correct owner for each association.
Dmytro Savochkin
Fix view runtime for controllers with async queries.
fatkodima
Fix load_async to work with query cache.
fatkodima
Fix polymorphic belongs_to to correctly use parent's query_constraints.
fatkodima
Fix Preloader to not generate a query for already loaded association with query_constraints.
fatkodima
Fix multi-database polymorphic preloading with equivalent table names.
When preloading polymorphic associations, if two models pointed to two
tables with the same name but located in different databases, the
preloader would only load one.
Ari Summer
Fix encrypted_attribute? to take into account context properties passed to encrypts.
Maxime R√©ty
Fix find_by to work correctly in presence of composite primary keys.
fatkodima
Fix async queries sometimes returning a raw result if they hit the query cache.
ShipPart.async_count could return a raw integer rather than a Promise
if it found the result in the query cache.
fatkodima
Fix Relation#transaction to not apply a default scope.
The method was incorrectly setting a default scope around its block:
Post.where(published: true).transaction do
  Post.count # SELECT COUNT(*) FROM posts WHERE published = FALSE;
end

Jean Boussier
Fix calling async_pluck on a none relation.
Model.none.async_pluck(:id) was returning a naked value
instead of a promise.
Jean Boussier
Fix calling load_async on a none relation.
Model.none.load_async was returning a broken result.
Lucas Mazza
TrilogyAdapter: ignore host if socket parameter is set.
This allows to configure a connection on a UNIX socket via DATABASE_URL:
DATABASE_URL=trilogy://does-not-matter/my_db_production?socket=/var/run/mysql.sock

Jean Boussier
Fix has_secure_token calls the setter method on initialize.
Abeid Ahmed
Allow using object_id as a database column name.
It was available before rails 7.1 and may be used as a part of polymorphic relationship to object where object can be any other database record.
Mikhail Doronin
Fix rails db:create:all to not touch databases before they are created.
fatkodima

Action View

Better handle SyntaxError in Action View.
Mario Caropreso
Fix word_wrap with empty string.
Jonathan Hefner
Rename ActionView::TestCase::Behavior::Content to ActionView::TestCase::Behavior::RenderedViewContent.
Make RenderedViewContent inherit from String. Make private API with :nodoc:.
Sean Doyle
Fix detection of required strict locals.
Further fix render @collection compatibility with strict locals
Jean Boussier

Action Pack

Fix including Rails.application.routes.url_helpers directly in an
ActiveSupport::Concern.
Jonathan Hefner
Fix system tests when using a Chrome binary that has been downloaded by
Selenium.
Jonathan Hefner

Active Job

Do not trigger immediate loading of ActiveJob::Base when loading ActiveJob::TestHelper.
Maxime R√©ty
Preserve the serialized timezone when deserializing ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone arguments.
Joshua Young
Fix ActiveJob arguments serialization to correctly serialize String subclasses having custom serializers.
fatkodima

Action Mailer

  No changes.

Action Cable

  No changes.

Active Storage

Fix N+1 query when fetching preview images for non-image assets.
Aaron Patterson & Justin Searls
Fix all Active Storage database related models to respect
ActiveRecord::Base.table_name_prefix configuration.
Chedli Bourguiba
Fix ActiveStorage::Representations::ProxyController not returning the proper
preview image variant for previewable files.
Chedli Bourguiba
Fix ActiveStorage::Representations::ProxyController to proxy untracked
variants.
Chedli Bourguiba
Fix direct upload forms when submit button contains nested elements.
Marc K√∂hlbrugge
When using the preprocessed: true option, avoid enqueuing transform jobs
for blobs that are not representable.
Chedli Bourguiba
Process preview image variant when calling ActiveStorage::Preview#processed.
For example, attached_pdf.preview(:thumb).processed will now immediately
generate the full-sized preview image and the :thumb variant of it.
Previously, the :thumb variant would not be generated until a further call
to e.g. processed.url.
Chedli Bourguiba and Jonathan Hefner
Prevent ActiveRecord::StrictLoadingViolationError when strict loading is
enabled and the variant of an Active Storage preview has already been
processed (for example, by calling ActiveStorage::Preview#url).
Jonathan Hefner
Fix preprocessed: true option for named variants of previewable files.
Nico Wenterodt

Action Mailbox

  No changes.

Action Text

  No changes.

Railties

Make sure config.after_routes_loaded hook runs on boot.
Rafael Mendon√ßa Fran√ßa
Fix config.log_level not being respected when using a BroadcastLogger
√âdouard Chin
Fix isolated engines to take ActiveRecord::Base.table_name_prefix into consideration.
This will allow for engine defined models, such as inside Active Storage, to respect
Active Record table name prefix configuration.
Chedli Bourguiba
The bin/rails app:template command will no longer add potentially unwanted
gem platforms via bundle lock --add-platform=... commands.
Jonathan Hefner
