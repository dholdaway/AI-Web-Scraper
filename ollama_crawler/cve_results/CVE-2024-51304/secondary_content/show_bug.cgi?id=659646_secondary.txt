Hi team gentoo,
After an update to latest nvidia driver, when i try to log in on lightdm, the desktop environment doesn't start.
I have MATE and fluxbox, and neither of them starts.

I have an NVidia GeForce 650M, and I use bumblebee + nvidia-drivers.

If i disable bumblebee service from boot, and reboot the laptop, i can log in and my MATE desktop work (fluxbox too).

I don't know if it's a problem with bumblebee or nvidia (loaded from bumblebee)

I tried to downgrade to nvidia 390.48 : i can't have desktop, and 387.34 too.

So i think the problem isn't nvidia.
bumblebee it don't have been updated.

It's strange.

I think it's not only on my laptop : https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-8234468.html#8234468

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. have an NVidia Optimus laptop
2. install bumblebee + nvidia drivers + lightdm
3. log in and see the issue

It is sad to read that you have problems with the software. The situation seems to be a bit more complicate and requires some analysis.
We can not help you efficiently via bug tracker. The bug tracker aims rather on specific problems in .ebuilds and less on individual systems. 

I have had very good experience on the gentoo IRC [1] with questions like this. Of course there are also forums and mailing lists [2,3].
I hope you understand, that I will close the bug here therefore and wish you good luck on one of the mentioned channels [4].
Please reopen the ticket in order to provide an indication for an specific error in an ebuild or any gentoo related product.
