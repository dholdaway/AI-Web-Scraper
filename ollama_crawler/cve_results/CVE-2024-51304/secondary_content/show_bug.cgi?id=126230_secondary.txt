Description

Upgraded to the last version of cacti (0.8.6h_p20060108) from 0.8.6g, but the version shown in the about page is still 0.8.6g. 

This is due to the fact that the config.php (cacti/include) is not updated correctly.

I think that changes to this file should be managed in the same way that other config files. How could this be detected by etc-update?

It is managed the same way... What about following the postinstall instructions?

Ups. Yes, sorry.

Now, that should be easy with portage 2.1 and the new elog system. :-)
