James F. Risoleo, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We ended 2023 on a high note, marking the seventh consecutive quarter that Host achieved comparable hotel Total RevPAR, RevPAR, and comparable hotel EBITDA and comparable hotel margins at or above 2019 levels. Full year comparable hotel RevPAR grew 8.1% over 2022, driven by both rate and occupancy increases. In the fourth quarter, our RevPAR grew 1.5% over the fourth quarter of 2022 to $202.92. Our results during the quarter were driven by rate increases of 0.4% and continued occupancy improvements at our convention and downtown hotels.” Risoleo continued, “Over the course of the year, we continued to successfully allocate capital through reinvestment in our portfolio, share repurchases, and dividend increases. We are especially pleased with the work we have completed on our strategic objectives, which included redefining the hotel operating model with our managers, gaining market share through comprehensive renovations, and strategically allocating capital to development ROI projects. We believe we will continue to benefit from these ongoing efforts, which is underscored by our 2024 comparable hotel RevPAR guidance range of 2.5% to 5.5% growth over 2023. During the quarter, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 11% to $0.20 per share, returning to our pre-pandemic quarterly dividend level, and declared a $0.25 special dividend. Additionally, we repurchased $31 million of common stock in the fourth quarter, bringing total repurchases for the year to $181 million. We are optimistic on the backdrop for our business, and we will continue to position Host to take advantage of potential opportunities in the future.” _______________________________(1)NAREIT Funds From Operations (“FFO”) per diluted share, Adjusted FFO per diluted share, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel revenues are non-GAAP (U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). See the Notes to Financial Information on why the Company believes these supplemental measures are useful, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and the limitations on the use of these supplemental measures.

 Inside Host Hotels Resorts, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:

However, the range of potential outcomes on the economy and the lodging industry specifically remains exceptionally wide, reflecting varying analyst assumptions surrounding the impact of higher interest rates, inflation, ongoing labor shortages in key industries, and escalating geopolitical conflicts.

 Other - Other   Highlight
None of our hotels in Maui sustained physical damage from the August wildfires, and our hotels were still able to fill rooms with emergency response teams and displaced residents; however, we estimate that the wildfires negatively impacted our comparable hotel RevPAR and Total RevPAR by approximately 50 basis points and 70 basis points, respectively, for the full year.
