Description

          2013-06-22 12:29:30 UTC
        

Trying to update my system, I get:

---------------------------------------
emerge: there are no ebuilds built with USE flags to satisfy "virtual/python-imaging[python_targets_python2_5(-)?,python_targets_python2_6(-)?,python_targets_python2_7(-)?,python_targets_python3_2(-)?,python_targets_python3_3(-)?,-python_single_target_python2_5(-),-python_single_target_python2_6(-),-python_single_target_python2_7(-),-python_single_target_python3_2(-),-python_single_target_python3_3(-)]".
!!! One of the following packages is required to complete your request:
- sci-libs/scipy-0.12.0::gentoo (Change USE: -python_targets_python3_2 -python_targets_python2_7)
(dependency required by "sci-libs/scipy-0.12.0" [installed])
(dependency required by "@selected" [set])
(dependency required by "@world" [argument])
----------------------------------------

But it is installed

----------------------------------------
chichenitza profiles # equery uses python-imaging
[ Legend : U - final flag setting for installation]
[        : I - package is installed with flag     ]
[ Colors : set, unset                             ]
 * Found these USE flags for virtual/python-imaging-1:
 U I
 - - python_targets_python2_5 : Build with Python 2.5
 - - python_targets_python2_6 : Build with Python 2.6
 + + python_targets_python2_7 : Build with Python 2.7
 - - tk                       : Adds support for Tk GUI toolkit
----------------------------------------

My python targets are unmodified from the base profile:

----------------------------------------
chichenitza profiles # emerge --info |grep PYTHON_TARGETS
PYTHON_TARGETS="python2_7 python3_2"
...
chichenitza profiles # emerge --version
Portage 2.1.12.2 (default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/gnome, gcc-4.6.3, glibc-2.15-r3, 3.8.13-gentoo x86_64)
----------------------------------------

The ebuild looks a bit suspect; There is a strange RDEPEND syntax which isn't documented in the dev guide, but that's not to say it's wrong. For example:

	python_targets_python3_2? ( dev-python/pillow[tk?,python_targets_python3_2(-)] )

What does that minus sign in parentheses signify? It appears that is what portage is complaining about in the first message at the top of this bug report.

Also see:
http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-962550.html

Appears to be the same problem.

Please post your output of `emerge -vp sci-libs/scipy'.

chichenitza gdm # emerge -vp sci-libs/scipy

These are the packages that would be merged, in order:

Calculating dependencies... done!

emerge: there are no ebuilds built with USE flags to satisfy "virtual/python-imaging[python_targets_python2_5(-)?,python_targets_python2_6(-)?,python_targets_python2_7(-)?,python_targets_python3_2(-)?,python_targets_python3_3(-)?,-python_single_target_python2_5(-),-python_single_target_python2_6(-),-python_single_target_python2_7(-),-python_single_target_python3_2(-),-python_single_target_python3_3(-)]".

See an explanation in this gentoo-science mailing list post:
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.science/1976

Not really a bug but an unanounced migration - it is unstable after all.
