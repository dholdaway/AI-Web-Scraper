1. One of its dependencies(can't remember which one :( ) depends on app-misc/getopt , which can't be merged due to https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=286736
2. 
checking for openjade... /opt/gentoo/usr/bin/openjade
checking for xsltproc... /opt/gentoo/usr/bin/xsltproc
checking for XML catalog (/opt/gentoo/etc/xml/catalog)... found
checking for xmlcatalog... /opt/gentoo/usr/bin/xmlcatalog
checking for DocBook XML DTD V4.3 in XML catalog... not found
configure: error: could not find DocBook XML DTD V4.3 in XML catalog

/opt/gentoo/etc/xml/catalog is empty. To fix this error I simply put attached file into /opt/gentoo/etc/xml/catalog

i darkly remember, that i had that issue once, a while ago now. i will see whether i can repro this here. otherwise i have to put this in the category "unexplainable hiccups", since i didn't have the catalog problem since then.

for 1., #286736 has been fixed by now, so no problem there anymore :)

i can't reproduce the xml catalog problem, although i know i hit it once... so this is WORKSFORME, please reopen if the problem re-appears.
