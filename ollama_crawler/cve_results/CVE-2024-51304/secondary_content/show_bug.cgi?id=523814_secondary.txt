As in the summary I haven't been able to reach packages.gentoo.org (and devmanual.gentoo.org, BTW) since 16:00 CEST today.

# ping6 packages.gentoo.org
PING packages.gentoo.org(brambling.gentoo.org) 56 data bytes
^C
--- packages.gentoo.org ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 2007ms

On ipv4 everything is OK:
# ping packages.gentoo.org
PING brambling.gentoo.org (140.211.166.178) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from brambling.gentoo.osuosl.org (140.211.166.178): icmp_seq=1 ttl=49 time=222 ms

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 222.083/222.212/222.369/0.586 ms

Reproducible: Always
