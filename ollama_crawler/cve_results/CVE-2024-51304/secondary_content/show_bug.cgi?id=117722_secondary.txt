emerge sync writes this at the end:
" * An update to portage is available. It is _highly_ recommended
 * that you update portage now, before any other packages are updated.
 * Please do so and then update ALL of your configuration files.
"

I suggest to add information what particular commandline should the
user run. Update only portage? Or also the dependence? Should he use
--deep? Should he use --newuse? Should he run revdep-reconf after update
of the portage?

I once updated portage on a production server and it destroyed both portage and gcc and made the system unusable anymore. So I guess this matter must be a bit tricky.

einfo does not replace 'man emerge' or any other user docs. Update portage means exactly what it says - update portage (emerge --update portage).
