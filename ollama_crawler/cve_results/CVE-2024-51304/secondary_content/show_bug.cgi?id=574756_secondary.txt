Description

media-gfx/wings-1.1.1 does not compile anymore https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=513188

bugs remained open since years
https://bugs.gentoo.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=media-gfx%2Fwings&list_id=3069642

It would be great to have a recent version of wings available on gentoo, but the broken old package does not help anyone.
At least zugina lists more recent versions:
http://gpo.zugaina.org/media-gfx/wings

I suggest to treeclean wings-1.1.1 in 60 days

For the record it appears jer has taken over the package now.

It is completely impossible to work with a person unable to communicate at all 

At first no explanation at all and closing this as worksforme, later this

I simply ask you to, please, drop a comment explaining your changes instead of quietly interacting with us forcing us to try to reconstruct all the situation from scratch. I tell you because this is not the first time I have this kind of issue with you, and I have seen also the same with you and other people in many bug reports. It's sad that many of this conflicts could be avoided simply informing the involved parties :|

Thanks
