When I start the IM, it starts as away instead of online.

What is the behaviour in current stable? 

Sounds more like an upstream bug, so i guess you should report this to bugs.kde.org.

In the current stable is fine.

Also, it fails to go from away to online when there is again the activity

This is useful here to block the stabilization.

There only 2 commits since 4.11.2, so you can test which one introduced the bug and then report this upstream.

As stated in comment #1, this is in all probability an upstream issue, and should be reported there too (we only package kopete, we don't develop it).

Yes, I understand that.  Was a bug filed upstream?  I could go dig around there, but I would sort of expect a post here linking to that upstream report.  So my ping is to find any knowledge of the state of that upstream report - I suppose I could have taken a moment to state that initially, though I thought it was implied.
I see bug reports here sit for weeks, silent, so that anybody who tries to keep abrest of things and perhaps lend a hand would not have a good method to find the current state of things.
If I am wrong that I should expect some ability to check status here, then where should I look?

Hi, thanks for your interest in the bug. I apologise if I sounded short in my previous comment - that definitely wasn't intended.

Normally if there is a KDE report it is linked in the bug here, however after a quick check I couldn't find anything.

Can anyone else confirm that 4.11.2-r1 definitely works?

Yes, works for me.

Is this on the same machine? This could be a tricky one, it looks like 4.11.2-r1 backports the only two changes made since .4

Ago, could you please identify which one of the two commits introduces the problem?

It is not reproducible always, so the cause could not be kopete itself.
