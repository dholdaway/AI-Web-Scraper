The cve description says:

  Integer underflow in the pixman_trapezoid_valid macro in pixman.h in Pixman
  before 0.32.0, as used in X.Org server and cairo, allows context-dependent
  attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a negative bottom value


I make another search and I never seen any mention of code execution.

Additional research made by RedHat guys says that possibility of code execution exists[1], that's why GLSA mentions it.
