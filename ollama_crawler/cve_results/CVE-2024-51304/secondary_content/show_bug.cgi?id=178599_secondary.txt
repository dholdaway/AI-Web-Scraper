Reopen with the real errors, as the message told you, not with this call stack.

Assuming local hickup here as ktnef is a dependency of libkcal

Rebuild ktnef. If this doesn't help try revdep-rebuild. If this doesn't help feel free to reopen.

I tried both of the above with similar results. When i try to emerge ktnef, i get the error: !!!econf failed. I then tried revdep-rebuild and it completed, but neither emerge ktnef nor emerge kde-meta work afterwards.

Can you please attach the portage log for the emerge of ktnef and kde-meta?
If you haven't set it before, please define PORT_LOGDIR in /etc/make.conf and try to emerge the packages again.

No response and works for me.
