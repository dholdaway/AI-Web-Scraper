Exhibit 99.1
 
Clarivate Announces
Commencement of Term Loan Refinancing Transaction 
 
London, U.K., January 22, 2024 –
Clarivate Plc (NYSE: CLVT) (the “Company” or “Clarivate”),
a global leader in connecting people and organizations to intelligence they can trust to transform their world, announced today the launch
of a process to refinance the Company’s 2026 Term Loan B credit facility that would extend the maturity to 2031 for a new combined
term loan amount of $2.2 billion. 
 
“We are proactively capitalizing on the favorable debt market
environment in order to provide further flexibility within our capital structure,” said Jonathan Collins, Executive Vice President
and Chief Financial Officer. “With our strong free cash flow, we continue to focus on investing for growth and reducing our debt
to drive long-term shareholder value.”
 
The Company also announced that it expects
to record a non-cash goodwill impairment charge in the range of approximately $800 million to $900 million in the fourth quarter
2023, across the Intellectual Property and Life Sciences & Healthcare segments. The charge is expected to lower the
Company’s 2023 forecast of a GAAP net loss but will have no impact on the 2023 full year outlook for Revenues, Organic Revenue
Growth, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Diluted EPS and Free Cash Flow as outlined in its third quarter 2023
earnings press release issued on November 7, 2023.
 
Terms of the potential refinancing will be disclosed upon the completion
of the transaction. The proposed refinancing is subject to market and other conditions, and there can be no assurance that it will be
completed on favorable terms or at all.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Non-GAAP results are not presentations made in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and are presented only as a supplement to our financial statements based on
GAAP. Non-GAAP financial information is provided to enhance the reader’s understanding of our financial performance, but none of
these non-GAAP financial measures are recognized terms under GAAP. They are not measures of financial condition or liquidity, and should
not be considered as an alternative to profit or loss for the period determined in accordance with GAAP or operating cash flows determined
in accordance with GAAP. As a result, you should not consider such measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial measures
or results of operations calculated or determined in accordance with GAAP.
 
We use non-GAAP measures in our operational and financial
decision-making. We believe that such measures allow us to focus on what we deem to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing
operating performance and our ability to generate cash flow from operations, and we also believe that investors may find these
non-GAAP financial measures useful for the same reasons. Non-GAAP measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors,
and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies comparable to us, many of which present non-GAAP measures when
reporting their results. These measures can be useful in evaluating our performance against our peer companies because we believe
the measures provide users with valuable insight into key components of GAAP financial disclosures. However, non-GAAP measures have
limitations as analytical tools and because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of non-GAAP financial
measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
 

The following information was filed by Clarivate Plc (CLVT) on Monday, January 22, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.
