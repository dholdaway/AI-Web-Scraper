net-tools-1.60-r11 ebuild calls for net-tools-1.60-patches-1.1 when only net-tools-1.60-patches-1.0 is available for download from any gentoomirror/distfiles/ directory.  

Editing the ebuild and changing 

PVER=1.1
to
PVER=1.0

and then running

ebuild /usr/portage/sys-apps/net-tools/net-tools-1.60-r11.ebuild digest 

downloads the available patch.   No clue if this will work as it is compiling right now.  Should there be a 1.1 patch or is the ebuild incorrect in stating that PVER=1.1?

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.emerge sync
2.emerge system (emerge -f system is what I used and it flagged with errors)


Actual Results:  
emerge -f system returend with:

!!! Some fetch errors were encountered.  Please see above for details.

The error was a 404 file not found on all mirrors that I tried to connect to

Expected Results:  
It should have downloaded patch-1.1
