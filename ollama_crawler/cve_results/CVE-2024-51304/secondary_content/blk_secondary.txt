BlackRock Reports Full Year 2023 Diluted EPS of $36.51, or $37.77 as adjustedFourth Quarter 2023 Diluted EPS of $9.15, or $9.66 as adjustedBlackRock Announces Agreement to Acquire Global Infrastructure Partners (“GIP”) – Creating a World Leading Infrastructure Investment Platform


 New York, January 12, 2024 – BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE: BLK) today reported financial results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023.

 







BlackRock’s acquisition of GIP will create a combined infrastructure platform of over $150 billion*, well positioned to meet fast-growing investor demand$10 trillion in AUM following $289 billion of full year net inflows, including $96 billion in the fourth quarterFlat full year revenue primarily driven by the negative impact of markets on average AUM, partially offset by higher technology services revenue Restructuring charge of $61 million from initiative to reorganize specific platforms, primarily Aladdin and illiquid alternative investments, to stay ahead of client needs, excluded from as adjusted results2% decrease in full year operating income 7% increase in full year diluted EPS also reflects significantly higher nonoperating income, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate in the current year$4.5 billion returned to shareholders in 2023, including $1.5 billion of share repurchases2% increase in quarterly cash dividend to $5.10 per share approved by Board of Directors
 
Laurence D. Fink, Chairman and CEO:“BlackRock delivered differentiated organic growth and operating margin through historically challenging market and industry conditions in 2022 and 2023. As we’ve seen before, when investors were ready to put money back to work, they did it with BlackRock. Clients entrusted us with $289 billion of net inflows in 2023, including $96 billion in the fourth quarter. We enter 2024 with strong momentum – $10 trillion in AUM, accelerating flows, and an organization positioned for the future.“Today, we are announcing two transformational changes in anticipation of the evolution we see ahead for asset management and the capital markets. The strategic re-architecture of our organization will simplify and improve how we work and deliver for clients. And our acquisition of GIP will propel our leadership in the fast-growing market for hard-asset infrastructure.“Our clients’ needs have been our compass. Listening to them and applying that to our vision for the future of our industry drove our innovation in Aladdin, and how we led a revolution that made iShares ETFs ubiquitous. “We always viewed ETFs as a technology, a technology that facilitated investing. And just as our Aladdin technology has become core to asset management, so too have ETFs.  That’s why we believe embedding our ETF and Index business across the entire firm will accelerate the growth of iShares and every investment strategy at BlackRock. “The combination of BlackRock infrastructure with GIP will make us the second largest private markets infrastructure manager with over $150 billion in total AUM, providing clients – especially those saving for retirement – with the high-coupon, inflation-protected, long-duration investments they need.“We are incredibly excited about this next chapter in BlackRock’s history. This ambitious transformation of our firm positions us better than ever. Our clients, shareholders and employees will be its biggest beneficiaries.”
