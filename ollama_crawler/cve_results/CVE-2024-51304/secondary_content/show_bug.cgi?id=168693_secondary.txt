Description


Arvid Norlander





          2007-02-28 09:23:33 UTC
        

The xchat-2.8.0 ebuild should be patched with the upstream patch found at http://xchat.org/files/source/2.8/patches/xc280-fix-back.diff to solve /away without parameter not working (instead of unsetting away status it shows help for /away usage). That patch fixes the problem

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start xchat
2. Set away
3. Try to use /away without parameter to unset away status

Actual Results:  
Shows help for /away

Expected Results:  
Should unset /away

You can unset away using the menu or Alt+a instead, but it should still be fixed. And as a patch is available from upstream it shouldn't be hard.

oops, sorry seems like this stuff already exists but the version wasn't bumped for the fix. Not changing version number is what makes it hard for users to avoid filing bugs that are already fixed...
