The package media-video/mplayer-1.0_pre7-r1 build/compile fails without
media-libs/giflib.  Mplayer is dependent on giflib and this dependency is not
resolved automatically.  Once I manually emerged giflib mplayer built/compiled.
Thus (in order):
emerge media-video/mplayer-1.0_pre7-r1  (failed)
emerge media-libs/giflib  (success)
emerge media-video/mplayer-1.0_pre7-r1  (success)


Reproducible: Didn't try

Unmerge libungif, emerge giflib, run revdep-rebuild, then emerge mplayer.
