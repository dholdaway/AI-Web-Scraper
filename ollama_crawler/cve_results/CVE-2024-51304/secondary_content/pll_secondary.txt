                                PRESS RELEASE | February 22, 2024 | NASDAQ: PLL    PIEDMONT LITHIUM REPORTS Q4 & FULL YEAR 2023 RESULTSNAL Operations Ramping, Growth Projects Progressing, and Balance Sheet Reinforced•$39.8 million full year revenue on sales of 43.2 thousand dry metric tons (dmt) of spodumene concentrate•$5.7 million full year gross profit, reflecting settlement accruals in Q4’23•Ramp up continues at NAL with further improvements in production and costs expected in 2024•2024 shipments expected to shift toward multi-year customer contracts; de-emphasizing volatile spot sales•Permitting and regulatory approvals advancing in Ghana and North Carolina•$71.7 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2023•Net proceeds of approximately $49.1 million from sales of Sayona Mining and Atlantic Lithium shares in Q1’24Belmont, North Carolina, February 22, 2024 – Piedmont Lithium Inc. (“Piedmont” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq:PLL; ASX:PLL), a leading global supplier of lithium resources critical to the U.S. electric vehicle supply chain, today announced fourth quarter and full year financial results for 2023.“2023 was a pivotal year for Piedmont as our Quebec joint-venture, North American Lithium (“NAL”), successfully commenced operations last March, leading to the first revenue in Q3 via shipments made under our NAL offtake agreement. As the largest lithium operation in North America, NAL has been successfully ramping up production over the past 10 months, with production hitting record levels in December. We are completing a few remaining capital projects in the first half of 2024 that we expect will result in further improvements in production and operating costs as NAL looks to achieve full run-rate production levels later this year.“We are pleased with the production ramp-up and prospects for long-term operations at NAL; however, our 2023 financial results were adversely impacted by the sharp downturn in lithium prices that occurred during the year and into 2024. We plan to shift our offtake volumes towards our multi-year customer contracts and reduce shipment volumes under spot sales agreements. We expect this strategy to result in less volatility and higher average realized prices.“While NAL is a current focus given its status as a producing asset, we believe Piedmont is well-positioned for the long-term with growth opportunities across our project portfolio. In Ghana, we are encouraged by the support of the Ghanaian government evidenced by the sovereign wealth fund’s investment into the Ewoyaa Lithium Project (“Ewoyaa”) announced last year. Ewoyaa continues to advance through the permitting and approvals processes, and the project is poised to be a near-term spodumene producer with exceptional logistics and relatively modest capital and operating costs.“We continue to make advances towards our mining permit in North Carolina for our Carolina Lithium Project, with the most recent set of questions from the state indicating that the review process for this important milestone could be approaching its conclusion. Our Carolina and Tennessee projects are strategically located in the growing Battery Belt and critical to the goal of achieving some level of lithium self-sufficiency in America. These projects will be advanced on timelines that take into account lithium market conditions, strategic partnering efforts, and government debt financing opportunities.“Lithium has been a cyclical business for the past decade with trough markets in pricing generally followed by new record highs. As we navigate the current market, which seems to be in the throes of ‘peak pessimism,’ we’re bolstering our balance sheet by monetizing non-core assets, deferring capital spending, and employing cost savings plans designed to reduce our corporate overhead. Our goal is to protect shareholder value in this downturn, while remaining strategically positioned for the lithium market recovery that we believe is a matter of time.”Keith Phillips, Piedmont Lithium President and Chief Executive OfficerThe following information was filed by Piedmont Lithium Ltd (PLL) on Thursday, February 22, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.
