Description

          2009-01-14 11:39:30 UTC
        

hello, I copied /usr/share/php/docs/SOAP/example to my public_html and tried to run example/wsdl_client.php (/usr/share/php/docs/SOAP/example/wsdl_client.php). I received the following error messages:

Notice: Undefined index: in /usr/share/php/SOAP/WSDL.php on line 765
Warning: reset() [function.reset]: Passed variable is not an array or object in /usr/share/php/SOAP/WSDL.php on line 768
Warning: current() [function.current]: Passed variable is not an array or object in /usr/share/php/SOAP/WSDL.php on line 769
Warning: reset() [function.reset]: Passed variable is not an array or object in /usr/share/php/SOAP/WSDL.php on line 587
Warning: current() [function.current]: Passed variable is not an array or object in /usr/share/php/SOAP/WSDL.php on line 588
Fatal error: Class 'WebService_' not found in /usr/share/php/SOAP/WSDL.php on line 788

So it seems like there is something wrong in this package.

Reproducible: Always

You need to copy the whole SOAP docs dir (/usr/share/php/docs/SOAP) to your document root, and you need to execute the example from that path (http://localhost/SOAP/examples/wsdl_client.php) and even then the examples are provided as is from upstream and are purely that, examples.

This error points to incorrect usage rather than this package being broken.

I agree with Jamie here. Please copy /usr/share/php/docs/SOAP into your webroot and run the example from there.

While i agree the examples are not perfect, there is nothing gentoo can do about that. If you can get upstream (http://pear.php.net/package/Soap) to update their examples and/or code, i will happily include that into the tree.
