The handle on the slider which shows the position in the file is stuck at the left hand side of the bar. You can drag an invisible handle along it to seek through the file but the actual visible handle stays on the left.

since mplayer now also plays wmvs, what exactly is the point in keeping mplayer-bin around? is there anything left mplayer can't do that mplayer-bin can?

yes there are quite a few formats that mplayer-bin plays, but not mplayer.. if I remember correctly, there is at least one version of WMV that still requires the non-free stuff.

WMV is still only the tip of the iceberg, there are far more codecs that 32-bit player can play than 64 can.  Of course, they're all pretty unheard of, but still.   Realplayer and some QT libs do fall into that category though.

Any chance this was resolved with the version bump some time ago?

I can't comment as I'm currently using Arch not gentoo.
