HOSTAP drivers for the PRISM cards will start the card in "Master" mode, as if an access point. To change this iwconfig needs to be run before wpa_supplicant to set the mode first.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Setup wpa_supplicant as in the examples in /etc/conf.d/net
2.Plug in PCMCIA card.
3.Card starts in master mode and wpa_supplicant never associates.

Actual Results:  
Card starts in master mode and wpa_supplicant never associates.

Expected Results:  
It needs to set the card to "managed" mode, although wpa_supplicant will respond
according to the detected essid.

hostap-driver-0.2.6-r1
wpa_supplicant-0.2.7
sys-apps/baselayout-1.11.10-r3

Created attachment 56013 [details, diff]
calls iwconfig_defaults and iwconfig_user_config if available

This patch will allow to to use iwconfig and iwpriv commands for wpa_supplicant

Patch is for baselayout-1.11.10-r6

Example

iwconfig_eth1="mode managed"
