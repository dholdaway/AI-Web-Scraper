After the second time. When the backlight is already switched off and on again. The next cycles backlight wont be switched off again. It seems the timers are screwed after that.


Reproducible: Always




Its on a Macbook 2,1.

btw. this happens to gnome-power-manager-2.24.4-r2 too. maybe it's the fault of gnome-screen-saver. i'm not sure where to report this exactly.
my gnome-screensaver-installed is: 2.26.1

confirming, this has been going on for even longer. I think I started noticing it in 2.20 or 2.22.

Unfortunately, I've had other bugs to fix and this one is fairly low on my list (and now I used "xset" to turn off my screen...) so if you could open a bug in gnome's bugzilla and paste the URL here, that'd be great.

Thanks

i played around a bit and tried different combinations. it seems that gnome-screen-saver is involved in this. when i turn off the screensaver,excatly the  inactivity timer, switching off screen/backlight works again several times.
should i open a new bugreport for gnome-screensaver?
maybe it's a bad interaction of both.

I still have the issue after x11-base/xorg-server-1.6.3.901-r2.

So the issue is fixed not for x11-base/xorg-server-1.6.3.901-r2 but for 1.6.5
