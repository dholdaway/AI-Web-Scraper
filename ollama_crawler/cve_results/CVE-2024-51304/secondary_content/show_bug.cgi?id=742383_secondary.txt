This looks to be an issue with the kernel sources being provided on the tinderbox. It seems to be missing generated files for building out-of-tree modules.

Could you try running `make prepare`, which does generate all the requires files and try again?

I do not consider this a missing dependency, but a problem on the tinderbox, which seems to be missing generated kernel files for building out-of-tree modules. See my comment 2.
