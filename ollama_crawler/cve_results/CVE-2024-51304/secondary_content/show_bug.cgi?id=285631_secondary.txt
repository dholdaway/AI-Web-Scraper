Description


water





          2009-09-20 01:17:13 UTC
        

my computer is thinkpad t43.
I use gnome-power-manager 2.26.4.
when computer is running, if I turn off AC or on AC, gnome-power-manager 2.26.4 can display power state correctly.

but if AC is on and I suspend or hibernate , then turn off AC , last open machine, at that time gnome-power-manager still display AC is on.

If I change AC state when suspend and hibernate, after I open machine again, it can not display correct power state.

How to do with it?
Thanks
