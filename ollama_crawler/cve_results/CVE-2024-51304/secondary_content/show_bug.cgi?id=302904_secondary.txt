Description


Diego Elio Pettenò (RETIRED)

Currently it depends on rubyzip 0.5 or later, we got 0.9.1 (old) and 0.9.4 (added today, fakegem-capable), as well as a 0.5 ebuild, so I don't know about API compatibility.

Also, the way it installs is, at a minimum, over-complex: ruby files are installed in /usr/share (acceptable) and a non-exec bash wrapper script (calling into ruby18 explicitly, up to this would be right as rubyzip fails with both ruby19 and jruby) is added to /usr/bin.

I'm closing this bug: the package looks to be unmaintained upstream, so let's just leave it ruby18 only. When we get bug reports for it we can always decide to remove the package or fix the bugs.
