Latest stable gentoo-sources on most arches now is 2.6.25.

Latest stable linux-headers rests at 2.6.23 (except ppc64 at 2.6.24).

Please, could you confirm if this 'mismatch' is an issue?
Thanks a lot.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.equery list -p gentoo-sources
2.equery list -p linux-headers

Non-issue. Current stable glibc is several month old and won't use any features provided by newer headers.
