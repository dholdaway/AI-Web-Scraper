When trying to emerge kdeplasma-addons, it fails to compile saying something is not declared in scope.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge "=kdeplasma-addons-4.2.0"

you build without -opengl USE flag I suppose and you don't have mesa installed, but that should work anyway:
- please attach your /var/tmo/portage/kde-base/kdeplasma-addons-4.2.0/work/kdeplasma-addons-4.2.0/applets/CMakeLists.txt (can be obtained during the build)

I suspect something with your opengl setup in gentoo - maybe you forgot to run eselect opengl set <provider> when you emerged some drivers.

Any new info with that one? Still reproducible with 4.2.3?

Please reopen if it applies to ~kde-base/kdeplasma-addons-4.2.3
