  Exhibit 99.1Neal GoldnerInvestor Relations407-206-6149neal.goldner@mvwc.comCameron KlausGlobal Communications407-513-6066cameron.klaus@mvwc.comMarriott Vacations Worldwide Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results ORLANDO, Fla. – February 21, 2024 – Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation (NYSE: VAC) (“MVW” or the “Company”) reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 and provided guidance for full year 2024.“After a challenging year, we ended the year on a very positive note, growing contract sales by 4% in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis with VPG in-line with the prior year, after adjusting for the estimated impact of the Maui wildfires,” said John Geller, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The transition to Abound by Marriott Vacations is behind us. Moving forward, we continue to look for ways to leverage technology to grow our revenues while driving efficiencies and cost savings across the organization.”Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights•Consolidated Vacation Ownership contract sales declined 2% year-over-year to $447 million driven by 2% lower volume per guest (“VPG”). The Company estimates that excluding the impact of the Maui wildfires, contract sales would have grown 4%, tours would have increased 4% and VPG would have been unchanged compared to the prior year.•Net income attributable to common stockholders was $35 million and fully diluted earnings per share was $0.93.•Adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders was $75 million and adjusted fully diluted earnings per share was $1.88.•Adjusted EBITDA was $186 million.•The Company repurchased 431,000 shares of its common stock for $38 million during the quarter and increased its quarterly dividend to $0.76 per share, which was paid in January. For the year, the Company repurchased 6% of its shares outstanding for $286 million and paid $106 million in dividends.Fourth Quarter 2023 ResultsOn August 8, 2023, a wildfire devastated the area of West Maui. While the Company operates four vacation ownership resorts and sales centers in the area, it did not sustain any physical damage to these resorts and sales centers. However, the Company estimates the Maui wildfires negatively impacted its fourth quarter contract sales by approximately $25 million, Net income attributable to common stockholders by $17 million and Adjusted EBITDA by $24 million.In the third quarter of 2022, the Company aligned its contract terms for the sale of its Marriott-, Westin-, and Sheraton-branded vacation ownership products, resulting in the acceleration of revenue from the sale of Marriott-branded vacation ownership interests. In addition, the Company aligned its reserve methodology for vacation ownership notes receivable for these brands, resulting in a decrease in the reserve for the acquired notes offset by an increase in the reserve for the originated notes. Together, these changes are referred to as the “Alignment.” The following information was filed by Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corp (VAC) on Wednesday, February 21, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.
