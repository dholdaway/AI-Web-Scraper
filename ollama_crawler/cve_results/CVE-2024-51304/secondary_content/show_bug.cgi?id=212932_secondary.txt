When starting kopete you can see:

kopete(7359)/libkopete Kopete::PluginManager::loadPluginInternal: Unable to find a plugin named ' "" '!
kopete(7359)/libkopete Kopete::PluginManager::loadPluginInternal: Unable to find a plugin named ' "kopete_icq" '!

As a result there is no ICQ plugin in kopete.

Do you have the oscar use flag for kopete enabled?
If not please reinstall it with enabled oscar use flag and report if it still happens.

... of course - it is working now. Thank you very much.

Now I know: OSCAR protocol is AIM/ICQ protocol... I was looking for icq flag (also exists), oscar was (is?) less intuitive.
