Description

          2012-05-21 21:14:07 UTC
        

In mail-client/thunderbird-12.0.1 enigmail is not working.
Signed messages can not be verified; when trying to send signed mail an errormessages shows that enigmail can not be initialized.

Reproducible: Always




mail-client/thunderbird-12.0.1 was built with the following:
USE="alsa crashreporter crypt dbus ipc lightning minimal (multilib) webm -bindist -custom-cflags -custom-optimization -debug -gconf -libnotify -mozdom -startup-notification -system-sqlite -wifi" LINGUAS="de -ar -ast -be -bg -bn_BD -br -ca -cs -da -el -en_GB -es_AR -es_ES -et -eu -fi -fr -fy_NL -ga_IE -gd -gl -he -hu -id -is -it -ja -ko -lt -nb_NO -nl -nn_NO -pa_IN -pl -pt_BR -pt_PT -rm -ro -ru -si -sk -sl -sq -sr -sv_SE -ta_LK -tr -uk -vi -zh_CN -zh_TW"

rm \${HOME}/.thunderbird/*/extensions.sqlite

I put extensive testing into each build before adding to tree to ensure there are no bugs with enigmail.
