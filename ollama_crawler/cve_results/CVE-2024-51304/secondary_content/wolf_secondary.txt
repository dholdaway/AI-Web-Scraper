Exhibit 99.1 Wolfspeed Reports Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2024Mohawk Valley Momentum Driving 100% Year-over-Year Growth in EV RevenueMohawk Valley Fab Targeted to Reach 25% Utilization in Q1FY25, One Quarter Ahead of ScheduleCompany Plans to Accelerate Shift of Device Fabrication to 200mm Mohawk Valley Fab, Assess Timing of Closure of 150mm Durham Device FabReducing FY25 net CapEx Spend by $200 MillionDURHAM, N.C. August 21, 2024 -- Wolfspeed, Inc. (NYSE: WOLF) today announced its results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and the full 2024 fiscal year.Quarterly Financial Highlights (Continuing operations only. All comparisons are to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.)•Consolidated revenue of approximately $201 million, as compared to approximately $203 million◦Mohawk Valley Fab contributed approximately $41 million in revenue•Power device design-ins of $2.0 billion •Quarterly design-wins of $0.5 billion •GAAP gross margin of 1%, compared to 29%•Non-GAAP gross margin of 5%, compared to 31%◦GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 include the impact of $24 million of underutilization costs. See "Start-up and Underutilization Costs" below for additional information.Full Fiscal Year Financial Highlights (all comparisons are to fiscal 2023)•Consolidated revenue of approximately $807 million, as compared to approximately $759 million•GAAP gross margin of 10% as compared to 32%•Non-GAAP gross margin of 13% as compared to 35%◦GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins for fiscal 2024 include the impact of approximately $124 million of underutilization costs. See "Start-up and Underutilization Costs" below for additional information.“We have two priorities we are focused on: optimizing our capital structure for both the near term and long term and driving performance in our state-of-the-art, 200-millimeter fab, and this quarter was a step forward on both of these priorities,” said Wolfspeed CEO, Gregg Lowe. “We achieved 20% utilization at Mohawk Valley in June and continued to see strong revenue growth from that fab. Our 200mm device fab is currently producing solid results, which are at significantly lower costs than our Durham 150mm fab. This improved profitability gives us the confidence to accelerate the shift of our device fabrication to Mohawk Valley, while we assess the timing of the closure of our 150mm device fab in Durham. At the JP, we have also made great progress, installing and activating initial furnaces in the fourth quarter. We have already processed the first silicon carbide boules from the JP and the quality is in line with the high-quality materials coming out of Building 10."At the same time, we are taking proactive steps to slow down the pace of our CapEx by approximately $200 million in fiscal 2025 and identify areas across our entire footprint to reduce operating costs. We also remain in constructive talks with the CHIPS office on a Preliminary Memorandum of Terms for capital grants under the CHIPS Act. In addition to any potential capital grants from the CHIPS program, our long-term CapEx plan is expected to generate more than $1 billion in cash refunds from Section 48D tax credits from the IRS, of which we’ve already accrued approximately $640 million on our balance sheet,” continued Lowe.1The following information was filed by Wolfspeed, Inc. (WOLF) on Wednesday, August 21, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.
