I use Gentoo as a terminal server for a dozen or so thin clients. The server does not have a sound card, and does not have sound configured. When trying to start the latest frozen-bubble, it crashes trying to use sound. Even when using the --no-sound flag, it still crashes ...

$ frozen-bubble  --no-sound

I was eventually able to configure sound using the dummy module, but still this should not be necessary.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Run frozen-bubble on system with no sound configured

Actual Results:  
Crash.

Expected Results:  
Play frozen-bubble.

frozen bubble is a perl program.
It seems to me that is using sdl-perl (that use libsdl) to do is sound things, and SDL is initialized with everything available.
I think you should try to build libsdl with the "noaudio" use flag and then retry.
