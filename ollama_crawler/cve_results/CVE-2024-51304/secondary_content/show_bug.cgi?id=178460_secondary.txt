Description

          2007-05-14 03:45:18 UTC
        

I've started installing a fresh version of Gentoo for the first time. I was able to compile all the programs using emerge except for MySQL which booms right away.It crashes when opening the mysql-extras-20070415.tar.bz2 file.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge mysql
2.
3.

Actual Results:

Expected Results:  
I would hopefully have it completely installed.

I also added a file to the /etc/protage/protage.use the line

dev-db/mysql berkdb perl ssl -big-tables -cluster -debug -embedded -extraengine -latin1 -max-idx-128 -minimal (-selinux) -static

(which was mostly a copy paste from emerge --pretend mysql) 

Though the problem was occuring even before I created this file. The reason for creating this file was that I thought that there might be a simple issue with the USE flags.

Works for me.
Please use "emerge --sync", clear /var/tmp/portage/dev-db/mysql-5.0.38/ directory and try one more time.
If this wont help please provide "emerge --info" output and reopen bug.

Doesn't help!
I think that is problem in mysql-extras-20070710.tar.bz2 file. Cause its contains "mysql-extras-20070710" directory, but ebuild using function src_unpack search patches  in "mysql-extras" directory...

The ebuild doesn't have any src_unpack; the eclass hasn't been touched for months. It unpacks just fine here, suggesting you have some eclass junk in your overlay.
