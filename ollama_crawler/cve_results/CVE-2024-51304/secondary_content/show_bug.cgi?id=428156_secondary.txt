Why? The even newer icu4j-49.1 is already in tree.

Well, I was building eclipse juno on my system and it needs at least icu4j-4.4.2.1.
And netbeans requires icu4j:4.4 too, doesn't it.

Will this be updated or are there some issues that may arise because of this?

Different slots doesn't mean they are incompatible, just there might be packages which won't work with later versions. Always try using the slot of the latest version available in portage on any bump for every package. If it doesn't work lets look for a solution then.
