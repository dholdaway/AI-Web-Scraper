(NASDAQ: IRBT), a leader in consumer robots, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 30, 2023.  Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Performance Highlights•Revenue was $307.5 million compared to $357.9 million last year•GAAP net loss per share was ($2.28) compared to GAAP net loss per share of ($3.07) last year•Non-GAAP net loss per share was ($1.82) compared to non-GAAP net loss per share of ($1.54) last yearFiscal 2023 Financial Performance Highlights•Revenue declined to $890.6 million from $1,183.4 million in 2022•GAAP net loss per share was ($11.01) compared to GAAP net loss of ($10.52) in 2022•Non-GAAP net loss per share was ($7.73) compared to non-GAAP net loss per share of ($4.50) in 2022"As we shared last month, we are actively implementing an operational restructuring plan designed to both stabilize the business in the current environment and advance our growth initiatives," said Glen Weinstein, Interim CEO of iRobot. "The plan will simplify our cost structure, create a more sustainable business model, and enable us to focus on our core value drivers. As we move forward with urgency and focus, our management team and Board are confident in iRobot's ability to build on our innovation and to navigate this period successfully as a standalone company.""We are managing through a challenging period and making critical strategic progress that we believe will help expand and better position our business for the future," added Weinstein. "We are confident that the actions we are taking today will drive improved performance going forward."iRobot anticipates full year 2024 revenue between $825 and $865 million. iRobot expects full year 2024 GAAP net loss per share between ($3.13) and ($2.70) and non-GAAP net loss per share between ($3.73) and ($3.30).iRobot's top financial priorities are liquidity and careful cash management. With the operational restructuring plan announced last month, iRobot anticipates a significant improvement in cash outflow from operations in fiscal 2024 compared with the reported cash outflow from operations of ($114.8) million for full year 2023. Excluding the net proceeds from the $94 million break-up fee from Amazon, iRobot expects negative cash flow from operations in Q1 and Q2 and anticipates generating modest positive cash flow from operations in both Q3 and Q4 during fiscal 2024.The following information was filed by Irobot Corp (IRBT) on Monday, February 26, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.

 Inside Irobot Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Income   Highlight
The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, and the associated valuation allowance, could be adjusted in a future period if estimates of future taxable income change or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as projections for future growth.



 Other - Other   Highlight
Changes in these estimates and assumptions or the relationship between those assumptions impact our valuation as of the valuation date and may have a material impact on the valuation.

 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
We intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our U.S. and certain foreign deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances.

 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
In addition, valuation allowances were established in certain foreign jurisdictions during fiscal 2023 considering cumulative taxable losses in recent years and uncertainty with respect to future taxable income.
