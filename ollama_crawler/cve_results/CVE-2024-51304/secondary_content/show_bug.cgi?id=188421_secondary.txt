Using dspam stable 3.8.0-r3.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.emerge dspam with daemon use flag
2.configure dspam correctly
3./etc/init.d/dspam start

Actual Results:  
Dspam does not start, complaining about the non-existance of a file in /etc/mail/dspam.

Expected Results:  
Should work out of the box.

/etc/init.d/dspam

Its a dumb way to make a patch, but it should give the idea.

Considering that /etc/dspam is a symlink to /etc/mail/dspam created by the ebuild, I'd suggest that you re-emerge it.
