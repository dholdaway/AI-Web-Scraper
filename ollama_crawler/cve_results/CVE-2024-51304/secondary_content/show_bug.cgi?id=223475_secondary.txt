Description


Anders Aagaard

When using dmcrypt, baselayout-2, parallel booting and software raid, dmcrypt is started before my raid volumes are activated.  This results in a bad decrypted cryptsetup volume.

/dev/mapper/raid will exist, and from dmcrypt's perspective it looks ok, but will be linked to a unactivated /dev/md0.  The filesystem can not be mounted until I "cryptsetup remove raid" and rerun dmcrypt.

Reproducible: Always

some people do raid-on-dmcrypt while others do dmcrypt-on-raid.  there is no way to satisfy everyone.  if you need raid before dmcrypt, then set the dependency in your own conf.d file.  use rc_need as documented in `man 8 runscript`.
