Why not making dhcpcd start in the background? In some cases it can increase boot time twice.

Apparently my patch is a little wrong since ${command} sometimes is concatenated with args and '&' in the middle breaks the script.
But that doesn't change the initial idea. Can we do it?

i don't think so.  better to use the standard network scripts, or use things in parallel.

To make this happen, you can put

background

on a line in /etc/dhcpcd.conf.

Thanks William. Why it is not set by default?

It is if dhcpcd is controling more than one interface. If it is
controling only one interface and fails to get an address for it when
ipv4ll is turned off, the daemon fails to start.
