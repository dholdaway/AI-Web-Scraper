The consolekit ebuild complains if CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALL isn't set (and USE=pam), but this option isn't available on arm.

Reproducible: Always

pam_ck_connector.so won't work without audit syscall support from kernel, so I guess arm is stuck with using display managers with internal consolekit support (such as GDM) to workaround it

so not really a bug, just a feature that hasn't been completed for arm in kernel yet, sadly

and there are other minor arches where the same option is not supported yet, and this varies between kernel versions

so the exclude list to skip the warning for minor arches, plus the version based exclusions, is simply not worth the effort, you'd have to check the exclusion list for wide range of kernel versions and then with every new release... 

so closing as worksforme. sorry for getting useless warning, but the option is really required if you want consolekit entirely working, supported by the arch or not
