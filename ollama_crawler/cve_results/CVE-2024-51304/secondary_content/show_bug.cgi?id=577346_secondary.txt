May I present tomboy64. He has opted to hide his identity but sometimes goes by the pseudonym Matthew Brewer. I gather this has been agreed with the relevant people and he says that the council can contact him directly for his real name if absolutely necessary. Please respect this decision. I've been speaking to him for some time and he hasn't even told me so it must be important to him. Here's some things I do know.

* Resides in Berlin, Germany.
* Can code in Bash, Scala, Haskell, Python, some C, C++, Java, Perl.
* Also has experience with networks and some cryptography.
* Has been using Gentoo since around 2004.

He's shown interest in helping the Java team, which is great news for us. He has already helped out with several things including IntelliJ IDEA and I2P. He also provided early feedback on using IcedTea 3 with ARM.

I've been loosely mentoring him for about 6 months and have given feedback on his ebuild quiz answers. I just need to make one final pass over the last few questions but I trust these will be good. He's already made a start on the end quiz and monsieurp has offered to assist with this as I'm busy as always. Hopefully we can turn that around quickly. We just wanted to file the bug now to make it official. :)

I've done that final pass over the first quiz, all good now. We've received all the answers for the end quiz so we'll move onto that.

Quizzes have been mailed to recruiting@gentoo.org, as well as the SSH key.

Thanks in particular to Chewi, who re-worked the two quizzes with me. On the last one mrueg and idella4 also helped, for which I am grateful.

I would also like to add idella4 as my co-mentor.

FYI, Matthew/tomboy64 has shared his personal details with the (majority of the) trustees so that, if needed for legal reasons, we have this information at hand.

I've granted +V on #gentoo-dev per Amynka request.

I will be your recruiter. Please contact me by email to schedule the first review session. If you think that recruiters aren't paying attention to this bug at any later point in time, it's your job to ping us on IRC if you don't want any delays.

I just submitted my reworked Quiz Answers along with bits_about_myself. Now waiting for the final interviews.
