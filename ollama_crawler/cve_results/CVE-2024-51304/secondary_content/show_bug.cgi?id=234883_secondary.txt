My desktop environment is gnome-base/gnome-light, I have just upgrade to =gnome-base/gnome-desktop-2.22.3. But when I run the "/usr/bin/gnome-about" command,the problem is:

"/usr/bin/gnome-about" tells about a following error:
File "/usr/bin/gnome-about", line 37, in <module>
import gnome
ImportError: No module named gnome

there is a missing dependcy (gnome-python).
It is the same as  http://bugs.archlinux.org/task/10980
