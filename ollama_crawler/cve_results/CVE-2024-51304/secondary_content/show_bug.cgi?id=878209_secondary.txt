Description

The x11-misc/birdtray ebuild is up to date at 1.9.0 (https://github.com/gyunaev/birdtray/). Using the current ebuild for whatever reason does not work for me, it does not detect when a monitored folder has new messages.

There have been several commits since then on the githib so I decided to compile it from scratch and just replace the birdtray binary with the manually built one. It immediately started working with no additional changes.

My only suggestion would be to add the new commits to the ebuild as a patch since the last full release was oct 21, 2020.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.emerge birdtray, launch.
2.does not detect new messages.
Actual Results:  
tray icon does not change.

Expected Results:  
tray icon changes with number of new messages.

Hello Andrew,

thanks for the report.

I can't confirm what you are saying because it works for me out of the box.

What you meant with "I decided to compile it from scratch and just replace the birdtray binary with the manually built one" ?

Did you try the -9999 ebuild?

I cloned it off github, compiled it, and copied over only /usr/bin/birdtray

And no I did not try -9999

-9999.ebuild is there for exactly what you did outside portage.

Anyway since it works for me and works for everyone else, since it looks to be an issue related to the code itself instead of the packaging I'd suggest to make an upstream report and see what they say.

I suggest to try this one if you want to find which exactly commit fixes your situation:
