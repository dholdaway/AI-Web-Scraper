Comparing GitClear to Waydev
An October 2024 analysis including pricing, screenshots, and data


GitClear and Waydev are two of the most widely adopted companies working on Developer Analytics.
While both companies connect to similar data sources (GitHub, Jira, Bitbucket),
the two are at odds on the question of
"How can developer metrics be used to create a better engineering culture?"

How is GitClear so price-competitive vs Waydev?

Divergent customer acquisition philosophies. Traditional GitClear competitors (LinearB, Code Climate Velocity,
Pluralsight Flow, etc) price in a mandatory/dedicated
sales rep
"account manager," ostensibly on behalf of ensuring that customers are fully utilizing the product.


Waydev uses a sales-driven customer acquisition funnel, which means they need to charge
considerably more to cover the salaries of a sales team.


GitClear also offers in-house experts via our Data Insights Program. The difference is
that our "dedicated support" program comes a la carte -- you are welcome to purchase it for a few months, and
then cancel it once you're up-to-speed on how the product works.







A few reasons customers choose GitClear







1. Flexible, product-driven pricing

Too expensive to publish






A sales-driven company is more expensive than a product-driven company. This makes GitClear a more appealing
option for companies sensitive to annual costs.

2. Developer-powered vs. Manager-powered



GitClear bills itself as "the most developer-friendly analytics tool," and it requires that developers grant permission
to those who want to filter on their individual stats. No other Developer Analytics tool gives developers control
over who views their data.


Every developer has dealt with a Bad Manager at some point in their career, so the burden is on the tool to
prove that those managers won't use it against the creators.






3. Pinpoint Tech Debt


Actionability of data matters. That's why GitClear helps pinpoint directories that have slowed down developers who dared wade into them.
Only GitClear allows you to utilize a substantiated metric to decide upon which directories to prioritize when you decide it's time to pick up the development pace.





4. Perfect for developer self-optimization


GitClear was originally built for developers that have a self-interest in improving: the developers in a startup.
Anyone in a small company understands how the business will live or die based on the rate at which code changes
can be deployed.

5. Empirically validated


Waydev derives measurements by analyzing git's reporting of Lines of Code and Commit Count.
The data that can be gleaned from these sources is prone to bursts of noise.
GitClear's Diff Delta metric has been empirically proven to correlate better with code evolution than
Lines of Code or Commit Count.

5.5 Rapid setup, no process changes



To reap the full benefit of Waydev requires training a team to participate in a specific regimen that allows the
software to generate data.


In contrast, GitClear was built to "Just Work‚Ñ¢Ô∏è". You log in, choose which repos to import,
optionally connect to Jira, and wait a few hours. No credit card or no sales demo necessary. Once you see
your data through GitClear, you'll realize why we grew more than 4x in 2021 alone.

The Waydev security breach of 2020

As reported by Zdnet and others,
Waydev suffered a security intrusion that compromised some users GitHub and GitLab access tokens. As published
on July 27, 2020:


Waydev, an analytics platform used by software companies, has disclosed a security breach earlier this month.
The company says that hackers broke into its platform and stole GitHub and GitLab OAuth tokens from its internal database.
Waydev CEO and co-founder Alex Circei told ZDNet today in a phone call that hackers used a blind SQL injection vulnerability to gain access to its database, from where they stole GitHub and GitLab OAuth tokens.


Threats are the only constant when running services that hold information perceived as useful to external
actors. In the worst cases, an upstream breach can have consequences for the company's downstream customers:



To their credit, Waydev's follow-up actions suggest to us that they learned from this experience.
Though a full technical postmortem of how the hack was perpetuated and how it was discovered has not yet been published.
