Pretty much the same as bug 36518. Not sure if I should re-open a two year old bug.

Running rip -S produces this error:

Connecting to CDDB...Use of uninitialized value in pattern match (m//) at /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.8/CDDB_get.pm line 397, <GEN0> line 1.
query error at cddb db: freedb.freedb.org:888 at /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.8/CDDB_get.pm line 398, <GEN0> line 1.
