I don't follow. You say that 2.8.4 has the problem but your eix output seems that 2.7.3 is installed

Ok this is a boost problem. You probably updated boost recently. Please rebuild rb_libtorrent and try again. Re-open the bug if needed

eselect boost list
Available boost versions:
  [1]   boost-1.41/default *
  [2]   boost-1.42/default
  [3]   boost-1.46/default

I've read 1.42 is more estable in amd64 plataform ? What version could I selected?

Choose whatever version you want, just make sure you re-emerge rb_libtorrent after you select your boost version
