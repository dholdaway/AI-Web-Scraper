 Inside Plug Power Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Expense   Highlight
With respect to production, although cost pressures from global energy prices and inflation have been less volatile than previous years, an increase in cost pressures or a rise in inflation could negatively affect our business again, which could have a pricing impact on our key raw materials.



 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Increased employee turnover, reassessment of employee responsibilities given current business needs, changes in the availability of our workers as well as labor shortages have resulted in, and could continue to result in, increased costs which could negatively affect our component or raw material purchasing abilities, and in turn, our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Changes to our key assumptions related to future performance and other economic and market factors could adversely affect our impairment evaluation.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Most components essential to our business are generally available from multiple sources; however, we believe there are some component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, particularly those suppliers and vendors that supply materials in very limited supply worldwide or supply commodities that have a high degree of volatility, whose loss to us or general unavailability could have a material adverse effect upon our business and financial condition.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
However, ongoing changes to, and evolution of, our products designs such as simultaneous design/build efforts and new product serviceability trends, or incorrect forecasting or updates to previously forecasted volumes could present challenges to those strategies despite best efforts in leveraging supplier relationships and capabilities.
