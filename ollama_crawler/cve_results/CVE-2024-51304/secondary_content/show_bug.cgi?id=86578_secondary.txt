I noticed commit emails aren't being sent out anymore after upgrading subversion from 1.1.1 to 1.1.3 on my server.

I put 1.1.1 back on the server asnd the commit emails work again. Any ideas what could be causing this?

Reproducible: Always

No idea. Hooks still work for me. Maybe your particular hook is broken. Remember that hooks are installed on a per repository basis.

I tried hitting the subversion mailing list, but no response so far.

Below is my hook script for my repository in /srv/svn/phaosLeague/conf/mailer.conf
--------------------------------------------------------
# mailer.conf: example configuration file for mailer.py
[general]
diff = /usr/bin/diff -u -L %(label_from)s -L %(label_to)s %(from)s %(to)s
mail_command = /usr/sbin/sendmail

[defaults]
commit_subject_prefix =
propchange_subject_prefix =
from_addr = svn@phaosleague.com
to_addr =
reply_to =
generate_diffs = no

[mailing list]
to_addr = phaosleague-svn@googlegroups.com
generate_diffs = no

[verbose]
to_addr = tom@phaosleague.com peter@phaosleague.com
generate_diffs = add copy delete modify
