When gnome-base/gnome-libs is compiling, it looks for orb.h in the wrong include dir.. (why?)

...
gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I.. -I.. -I./.. -DNEED_GNOMESUPPORT_H -I../support -I../support -I/usr/include -I/usr/include/glib-1.2 -I/usr/lib64/glib/include -I/usr/include/libIDL-1.0/orbit-1.0 -I/usr/include/gtk-1.2 -I/usr/include/glib-1.2 -I/usr/lib64/glib/include -DGNOMEBINDIR=/usr/bin -DGNOMESYSCONFDIR=\"/etc\" -DVERSION=\"1.4.2\" -I/usr/include/gtk-1.2 -I/usr/include/glib-1.2 -I/usr/lib64/glib/include -O2 -march=athlon64 -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe -I/usr/include/db1 -Wall -Wunused -c gnome-factory-stubs.c  -fPIC -DPIC -o .libs/gnome-factory-stubs.lo

/usr/include/libIDL-1.0/orbit-1.0  ---> !!?? it should be /usr/include/orbit-1.0.
