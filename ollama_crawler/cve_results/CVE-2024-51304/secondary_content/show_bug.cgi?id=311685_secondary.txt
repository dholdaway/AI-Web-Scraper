- If this package can be used as a library and installs Python modules
  (*.so or *.py) into site-packages directories, then consider supporting
  installation for multiple Python versions.
  Please read section "Types of packages" in documentation [1] to decide
  if this package can support installation for multiple Python versions.

- Ensure that the ebuilds do not use deprecated functions or variables.

- Please check if Python 3 is supported by this package. You can temporarily
  set Python 3 as main active version of Python to properly test if this
  package supports Python 3.

- If this package does not support Python 3:
  - Specify dependency on Python 2.
    You can use PYTHON_DEPEND helper variable, which should be set before
    inheriting of python eclass.
    Please read section "Specification of dependency on Python" in
    documentation [1].

  - If this package cannot support installation for multiple versions of
    Python, then set active version of Python using
    python_set_active_version().

  - Ensure that shebangs in installed scripts specify correct version of
    Python. If shebangs are too generic (e.g. '#!/usr/bin/python'), then you
    can use python_convert_shebangs() to convert shebangs.
    (Wrapper scripts generated by python_generate_wrapper_scripts() do not
    require any changes.)
    Please read section "Shebangs in installed scripts" in documentation [1].

  - To ensure that changes applied to the ebuilds are sufficient, please
    temporarily set Python 3 as main active version of Python and test if
    this package can be properly installed and if it works at run time.

Please see documentation [1] for more details.

Thanks but scribus-1.3.6 should be good, 1.3.5.1 will go away soonish.
