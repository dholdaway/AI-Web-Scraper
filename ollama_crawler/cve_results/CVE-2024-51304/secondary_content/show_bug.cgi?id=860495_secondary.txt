Are you using binpkgs at all?

Hello!

(In reply to Sam James from comment #1)
> Are you using binpkgs at all?

I did folow the advice in the bug you mentionned.
I could solve the problem in compiling harfbuzz with the USE -cairo -truetype
which worked fine, then rebuild it with these USE flag restored.
All work fine.
I cannot explain why this happens, but it worked.
Than you for all.
Kind regards,
Jean-Claude
