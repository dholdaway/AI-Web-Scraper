Running gorg will result in a immediate exit with code error 1.

Nothing is using port 8008, attaching the config file and the output of strace gorg.

I'm following http://gentoo.neysx.org/mystuff/gorg/gorg.xml and
http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gdp/doc/doc-tipsntricks.xml

BTW gorg is parsing individual files well.

Which version of gorg are you running? Is it from the main tree or an overlay?

From the strace log, it looks like you have something running on 8008 already, which is a typical reason for a server to exit like that:

socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP) = 3
setsockopt(3, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, [1], 4) = 0
bind(3, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(8008), sin_addr=inet_addr("127.0.0.1")}, 16) = -1 EADDRNOTAVAIL (Cannot assign requested address)

So, also please show output from 'netstat -tlpn'

The latest in the main tree.

output:"

"

'lsof -i :8008' also shows nothing.
