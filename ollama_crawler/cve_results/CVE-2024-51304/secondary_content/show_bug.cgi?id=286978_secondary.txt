Description

filelight is provided in two different slots which will block each other unless kdeprefix is used. With kdeprefix, no blockage is reported by the dependency mechanism, but emerging both at the same time results in file collisions for these files:

	/usr/bin/filelight
	/usr/lib/debug/usr/bin/filelight.debug
	/usr/share/apps/filelight/filelightui.rc
	/usr/share/icons/hicolor/16x16/apps/filelight.png
	/usr/share/icons/hicolor/22x22/apps/filelight.png
	/usr/share/icons/hicolor/32x32/apps/filelight.png
	/usr/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps/filelight.png
	/usr/share/icons/hicolor/64x64/apps/filelight.png

I know kdeprefix isn't officially supported, and I'm to blame for this dead kitten on my system. I thought you'd like to know in any case, so this can get fixed one day. Thus the bug report. I'll take care of my own system.

Possible solutions:
A) have filelight install under the appropriate prefix directory
B) stop slotting filelight, as there can only ever be one version

[ebuild  N    ] kde-misc/filelight-1.9_rc3  USE="(-aqua) -debug" 92 kB

filelight-1.0-r2.ebuild:SLOT="3.5"
filelight-1.9_rc3.ebuild:SLOT="4"

So there's no problem.

What are you trying to say? Why did you mark this WORKSFORME? The packages still don't block each other, changing the slot from 0 to 3.5 won't help this, as they still will both install the same file, /usr/bin/filelight.

Have you actually succeeded in installing both versions of filelight? In other words, does the following work for you:
FEATURES=protect-owned emerge -av filelight:3.5 filelight:4

If so, which of the packages does the file /usr/bin/filelight belong to, according to "qfile -v /usr/bin/filelight" from portage-utils?
If not, will you revert your verdict of WORKSFORME?
