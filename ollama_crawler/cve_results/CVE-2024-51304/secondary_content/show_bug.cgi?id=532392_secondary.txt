gentoo-functions isn't necessary if openrc is installed?

I know you guys are trying to keep everyone happy, and that's great, but I also know how aggressive the freedesktop people are about pushing systemd and as I understand it, openrc provides functions.sh?  I would be appreciative if gentoo-functions reflected this.  I think its kind of a slippery slope as with udev.

Reproducible: Always

Nevermind, I ASSUME that this isn't just for systemd.

It's not; but more importantly, functions.sh has changed location! So packages looking for /lib/gentoo/functions.sh need gentoo-functions even if the /etc/init.d/functions.sh provided by OpenRC is there.
