global use flags (searching: gtk)
************************************************************
[- cD ] gtk - Adds support for x11-libs/gtk+ (The GIMP Toolkit)

As we see here gtk+ is always dependend on so the gtk use flag usage does not match the describtion looking at the libraries dependent on it seems that the use flag should be named gnome as it pulls in gnome libraries.

The gtk USE flag is used for building the GUI. The GUI is built on GTK+, hence the use flag. Many other apps also use the "gtk" flag for optionally building a gtk-based GUI.

Renaming this to "gnome" is not appropriate since the GUI is no way dependant on GNOME - it works on any desktop.

I'm open to suggestions for other flag names if it improves consistency with the rest of portage.

I told the same to Petteri on irc Daniel have the same opinion as me. But indeed beagle depends of gnome-sharp.

Could you explain this then, as metalgod said the gui needs gnome libraries?

        gtk?    (       >=dev-dotnet/gconf-sharp-2.8
                                >=dev-dotnet/glade-sharp-2.8
                                >=dev-dotnet/gnome-sharp-2.8
                                >=dev-dotnet/gnome-sharp-2.8 )

KDE apps work in GNOME too but they are still KDE apps. The main problem I have is that I need to have most of GNOME installed, because of the dependencies, to use the GUI so it could as well be a full blown GNOME app and there would be no differences in the deps.

Indeed the situation is a bit problematic. The options that came to mind are gtk, gnome and a local use flag like gui. Adding a new local use flag is a bit confusing too. Another option is to have both gtk and gnome use flags and build the gui only when both are set. All in all this is such a minor thing that it isn't worth spending too much time on.

I phrased that badly, I should have probably said:

Renaming this to "gnome" is not appropriate since the GUI is no way dependant on the user running GNOME, neither does it integrate into GNOME specifically - it works on any desktop.

That's exactly the thing: USE flags represent functionality, *not* dependencies. 

Just because USE=myflag on app-foo/bar pulls in some random project hosted on gnome.org does not mean that myflag should be renamed to gnome. Same is true if USE=myflag pulls in 100 packages hosted on gnome.org.

In this case, USE=gtk enables a *GTK* GUI. This time around it just happens that the GTK GUI requires a number of low-level elements of your average GNOME desktop.

To put it another way, USE=gnome is for *functional* changes where the application can optionally integrate into GNOME. Examples of this include optionally including a GNOME panel applet, optionally providing a GNOME-VFS module, optionally installing yelp-based help files, etc. Just because this kind of optional functionality would pull in some core GNOME libraries as dependencies is _not_ the reason why the USE-flag is named "gnome".

I hope that makes it a little clearer :)

Closing this for now.. The situation isn't perfect but gtk is a more appropriate flag than gnome.
