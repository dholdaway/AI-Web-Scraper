Build fails when checking for mysqlclient library, see attached logs for details.

Libraries reside in /usr/lib64/mysql but search path does not include it.

I need emerge --info php too, or at least the list of USE flags you tried to use.

Please retry with mysql-5.5.37-r1 which is a stable candidate.

I know that both PHP and mysql have made changes since this bug was filed

Issue was tracked down to be using mysqli flag with latest mysql. This is unsupported upstream and I switched to mysqlnd. Works fine now
