Description

I have seen this change:
https://cgit.gentoo.org/proj/gnome.git/commit/?id=f1f7e5b963209fefcc2acc77261dd7eb69700165

But this will end up with people not using gnome2.eclass but only gnome2_environment_reset to need to inherit both eclasses and remember to call both: xdg_src_prepare and gnome2_environment_reset

This doesn't made much sense to me. From my point of view, if I run gnome2_environment_reset I expect to get it finally ready... and don't see that I need to call one more to finally reset all the needed environment and not have it set to variable and unpredictable values

well, lets see how the full set of final eclasses in the tree work finally 

Thanks for the work on this Gilles!
