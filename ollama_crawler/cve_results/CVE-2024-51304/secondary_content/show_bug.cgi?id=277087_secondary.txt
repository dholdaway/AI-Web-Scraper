Description

RealVNC (net-misc/vnc) compiles within the x11-base/xorg-server tree, and depends very closely on which version of xorg-server is installed.  
This is currently being handled via a variable in the net-misc/vnc ebuild:
XSERVER_VERSION="1.5.3"
Utilizing this solution is less than optimal however.  If x11-base/xorg-server is updated either there will be a dependancy problem with net-misc/vnc, or net-misc/vnc will fail to work.
The proper solution for this would be to merge elements of the net-misc/vnc ebuild into x11-base/xorg-server, which would eliminate the need for this variable, and the breakage which occurs if missed.  
This also streamlines ebuild development as it removes a redundant package from the tree.

Reproducible: Always

Rereading this a few hours after posting it (and for those not familiar with these ebuilds.) VNC actually downloads a copy of xorg-server (if necessary) and compiles within the source tree of xorg-server.

I think the current approach works fine; have you had any actual problems with it, or is it ok to close this bug?

The current approach works fine until xorg-server and vnc get out of sync at which point there's broken deps, or a broken vnc (if it doesn't compile against xorg-server, or compiles and then doesn't run)

nope, don't see this going to be happening. besides I think vnc is dead, and tigervnc it's preferred successor in future.
