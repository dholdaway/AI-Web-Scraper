Currently, after installing a new font package /etc/X11/fs/config needs to have an update in order xfs (x font server) to do something useful with it. It sounds trivial to add the new directory to the search pad of this config file.

Maybe it would be an idea to cache the directory after the fonts are installed and xfs is running.

Yes, programs exist to do this. But frankly, pretty much nobody cares about xfs anymore.

Did I miss something big? Isn't xfs the only way to get new fonts into X without restarting it?

Yeah, I think so. All current toolkits use fontconfig/freetype/Xft instead of the old core fonts mechanism, which is what xfs is for. The new client-side fonts don't require an X restart to be recognized.

I fail to see why this bug has been files w/ Gentoo at all... Plus, xfs is dead.
