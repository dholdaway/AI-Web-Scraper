"❌" (U+274C) is apparently new in Unicode 6.0. In inkscape, it renders as "Ü", and in pango-view it renders as a very very long empty space.

More details at the original report here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/inkscape/+bug/1796316

Works for me. Tested with 
Create Text Object F8
Font: Nimbus Sans L
❌

I see a black x, not red as on
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_mark

But I am not sure, if the black color is a bug in inkscape, because I do not expect a character linked to a color.

Using Nimbus Sans L, I still see a "Ü" in Inkscape.

The symbol is black and white in most fonts, so I don't expect colour unless choosing a specific font.

I'm not sure what to look for, if the problem is a specific package, or if it's a specific bad font that's installed…

It is sad to read that you have problems with the software. The situation seems to be a bit more complicate and requires some analysis.
We can not help you efficiently via bug tracker. The bug tracker aims rather on specific problems in .ebuilds and less on individual systems. 

I have had very good experience on the gentoo IRC [1] with questions like this. Of course there are also forums and mailing lists [2,3].
I hope you understand, that I will close the bug here therefore and wish you good luck on one of the mentioned channels [4].
Please reopen the ticket in order to provide an indication for an specific error in an ebuild or any gentoo related product.
