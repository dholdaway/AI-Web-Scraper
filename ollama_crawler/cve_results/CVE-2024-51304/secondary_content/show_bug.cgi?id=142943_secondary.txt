With alot of programs, there is either a man page, info page, or both for it, if the doc hasn't been totally ignored. My knowledge of scripting is pretty much useless atm (trying to learn Ruby atm), but a program/script to convert man pages into info pages would be nice, along with a utility to remove all man/info pages to help reduce the size of a system.
