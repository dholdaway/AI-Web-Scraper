Hi,

I just tried to install dev-python/pythonmagick but the compilation process failed with error messages of the kind

/usr/include/ImageMagick/Magick++/Image.h:122:47: error: reference to 'ssize_t' is ambiguous

A full build log is attached.
This appears to be the same problem as described in the Debian bug <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=587115>.

Cheers,
Nico

Reproducible: Always

Puts Boost namespace usage last

Okay, I gues I've figured it out:
The issue is very much related to <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.video.image-magick.bugs/3292>, with Boost's ssize declared prematurely. Putting the namespace declaration last fixes this.

Patch attached.

I'll contact upstream about this, too.
