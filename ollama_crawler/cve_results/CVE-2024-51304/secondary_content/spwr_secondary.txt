(NASDAQ: SPWR), a leading solar technology and energy services provider, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter, ending January 1, 2023. “Solar helps customers reduce and stabilize their escalating electricity bills while making a positive impact on the planet. With more consumers transitioning toward full home electrification, and new incentives to support that transition, the solar value proposition is more compelling than it’s ever been,” said Peter Faricy, SunPower CEO. “This is evident in our 2022 results: we beat our topline guidance for customer growth, closing the year with SunPower on more than half a million roofs in the U.S. We enter 2023 with our lowest level of net debt since first issuing convertible debt after the IPO over 15 years ago, diverse new supply agreements, and a clear strategy to remain the industry leader in customer experience.” BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS  World-class customer experience   •Highest rated solar company: In the fourth quarter of 2022, SunPower remained the top-rated1 solar company in the U.S. In 2022, the company also improved its overall Net Promoter Score (NPS) related to end-to-end experience in a customer’s first year from 35 to 45, a 29% improvement. These scores reflect the company’s focus on building software that makes it simpler to get solar and resolve issues more seamlessly, including transparent progress reports and self-service options.  Best, most affordable products   •Secured new supply to meet customer demand: In December, SunPower signed a new supply agreement with Maxeon (NASDAQ: MAXN) securing significant additional quantities of Maxeon's premium, high efficiency interdigitated back contact (IBC) solar panels through 2025. Today the company also announced it is sourcing panels from Hanwha Qcells out of its Dalton, Georgia facility. Growth   •Continued record growth trend: SunPower achieved record customer growth for the third consecutive quarter. It added 23,700 customers in the final quarter of the year, a 39% year-over-year (YoY) increase.•Growing new homes across the U.S.: In the fourth quarter, SunPower achieved record installations across the new homes business: California, national and multifamily and is preparing to operate successfully under tighter homebuilding market conditions in 2023 and possibly beyond.1 Based on public solar providers in the U.S. Includes average of BBB, Yelp, ConsumerAffairs, BestCompany, Google, SolarReviews and EnergySage reviews scores as of 12/31/22.The following information was filed by Sunpower Corp (SPWR) on Wednesday, February 15, 2023 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.

 Inside Sunpower Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
As of January 1, 2023, we believe there is insufficient evidence to realize additional U.S. and Mexico deferred tax assets beyond the state net operating losses that can be benefited with projected future taxable income; however, the reversal of the valuation allowance, which could be material, could occur in a future period.



 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Investing Activities The $438.7 million increase in net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily resulted from cash received from the sale of equity investments and the C&I Solutions sale in fiscal 2022, as well as an increase due to cash paid for the acquisition of Blue Raven in fiscal 2021, partially offset by higher purchases of property, plant, and equipment and cash paid for new equity investments under the Dealer Accelerator Program in fiscal 2022.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Sales, General, and Administrative ("SG&A") SG&A expenses increased by $135.2 million during fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to the acquisition of Blue Raven in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, increased strategic hiring across digital and business functions to support our growth strategy, increased investment in various subscriptions, licenses, and consulting, increased marketing and advertising expenses to support our sales strategy, as well as increased acquisition-related charges and transaction costs for corporate strategic transactions such as acquisitions and divestitures.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Interest expense decreased by $2.5 million during fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to a gain of $2.3 million recorded from changes in fair value of our interest rate swaps during fiscal 2022.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
Other income increased by $93.1 million during fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to a $115.2 million gain on an equity investment with readily determinable fair value during fiscal 2022, as compared to a gain of $21.0 million during fiscal 2021.
