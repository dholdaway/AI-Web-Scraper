Sales were $719 million, a 5% increase compared to the prior year’s fourth quarter sales of $684 million. The increase in fourth quarter 2023 sales included the favorable 7% impact of acquisitions and favorable currency translation of 1%, offset by an organic decrease of 3%. The organic sales decrease was driven by electronics dispense and biopharma product lines, offset by strong growth in medical interventional solutions, industrial coatings and polymer processing product lines.Operating profit in the quarter was $185 million, or 26% of sales. Adjusted operating profit, excluding $11 million in non-recurring acquisition costs, totaled $196 million, or 27% of sales. This was a 10% increase compared to prior year adjusted operating profit of $178 million. EBITDA in the quarter totaled a record $227 million, or 32% of sales, and represents an increase of 12% from the prior year EBITDA of $202 million.Net income was $128 million, or earnings per diluted share of $2.22. Adjusted net income was $142 million, excluding $7 million of non-recurring financing costs related to the ARAG acquisition. Fourth quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per diluted share were $2.46 compared to prior year adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.44. The increase was driven by higher sales, offset by higher interest expense.Commenting on the Company’s fiscal 2023 fourth quarter results, Nordson President and Chief Executive Officer Sundaram Nagarajan said, “The diversification of Nordson’s precision technology portfolio and the progress of the Ascend strategy shined through again this quarter. Our medical interventional solutions and several industrial precision product lines delivered double-digit growth in the quarter, while demand weakness in electronics and biopharma end markets persisted as expected. Throughout this dynamic year, our winning teams have remained focused on meeting the needs of our customers. They demonstrated an owner mindset and responded rapidly over the course of the year to changing market conditions. This led to total company performance exceeding our incremental profit targets. I am also very pleased with the integration progress of our recent ARAG acquisition, which contributed favorably to the fourth quarter results.”Fourth Quarter Segment ResultsIndustrial Precision Solutions sales of $405 million increased 14% compared to the prior year fourth quarter, driven by a 4% organic sales increase, a favorable acquisition impact of 7%, and a favorable currency impact of 2%. The organic sales increase was driven by record sales in our packaging, industrial coating and polymer processing product lines, largely driven by strong system sales in the Americas and Asia Pacific. Adjusted operating profit, which excludes non-recurring charges related to the ARAG acquisition, totaled $136 million in the quarter, or 34% of sales, an increase of 23% compared to the prior year operating profit. The increase in operating profit was driven by higher sales and improved sales mix.1The following information was filed by Nordson Corp (NDSN) on Wednesday, December 13, 2023 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.

 Inside Nordson Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
The discounted cash flow method ("Income Approach") uses assumptions for revenue growth, operating margin and working capital turnover that are based on management's strategic plans tempered by performance trends and reasonable expectations about those trends.



 Financial - Shares   Highlight
Issuance of common shares related to employee benefit plans generated $21,373 of cash in 2023, up from $12,124 in 2022.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
The decrease was the result of an organic sales decrease of 3.7 percent and unfavorable currency effects that decreased sales by 0.6 percent.

 M & A - Other   Highlight
Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins, discount rates, customer attrition rates, and asset lives, among other items.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Sales in the Asia Pacific region were $796,196, a decrease of 6.1 percent from 2022, with organic sales decreasing 8.2 percent and unfavorable currency effects of 3.1 percent, partially offset by a 5.2 percent increase from acquisitions.
