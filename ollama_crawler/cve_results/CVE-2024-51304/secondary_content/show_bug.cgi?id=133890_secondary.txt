<t35t0r> what does the d in dr1 stand for?
<Chainsaw> Developer Release.
<Chainsaw> 1.1 DR1 packaged.
<nenolod> (developer release is a fancy word for 'beta')
<t35t0r> so it's not an alpha?
nenolod t35t0r: you don't give alphas to third party devs.
<t35t0r> ahh ok i better rename the ebuild then

uploading a diff soon.

This was already in the portage tree, at least 15 minutes before you submitted your bug report. 0 day bump requests as these are often called are not appreciated.
