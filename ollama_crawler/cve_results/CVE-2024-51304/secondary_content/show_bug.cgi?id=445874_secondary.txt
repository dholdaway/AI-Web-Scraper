Description


Reuben Martin





          2012-12-03 23:13:12 UTC
        

Kernel configs that have CONFIG_LOCALVERSION set, are expected to have their modules installed in a director with the locale version appended as a suffix.

e.g.
\lib\modules\${kernel-version}${local-version}

This is not happening, they are being installed to a path without the prefix appended.

I've only now run into this problem and haven't tested it with other kmod ebuilds, so you may want to se if this problem exists with portage in general rather than just this specific ebuild.

Reproducible: Always
