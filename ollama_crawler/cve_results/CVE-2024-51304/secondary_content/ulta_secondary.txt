 Inside Ulta Beauty, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Debt   Highlight
In addition, inflation could cause the interest rates on any future debt to remain at an elevated level or increase.



 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Although we do not believe inflation had a material impact on our sales during fiscal 2023, continued pressure from inflation or other evolving macroeconomic conditions could have an adverse impact on consumer spending and could lead to a recession.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
Furthermore, inflationary pressures, as well as other macroeconomic trends, could negatively impact our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with higher costs.

 Other - Other   Highlight
A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized unless it is more-likely-than-not that such assets will be realized in full.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Any decrease in sales during these higher sales volume periods could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results for the entire fiscal year.
