Thank you for this ebuild, you may also want to investigate putting your ebuild in the sunrise overlay which is located at http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/sunrise/. When/if the ebuild is put into sunrise, please let us know on this bug.

Googling for "xsw ebuild" points to betagarden, see here:

https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=xsw+ebuild

So I guess we don't need to keep this bug open any more.  Closing.
