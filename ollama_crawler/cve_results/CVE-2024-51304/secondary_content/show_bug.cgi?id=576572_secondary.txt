Description

Hello people.

The thing is: I have my repo with ebuilds, one of them is for Unity3D. I think that everything's fine, except one bad issue: ${FILESDIR} returns nothing. It just doesn't exist; however, ${FILESDIR} is OK with my ebuild for Wine. Some console logs:

> root@m-Gentoo-PC /h/maxik# ls /var/tmp/portage/games-engines/unity3d-5.3.3/
> build-info/  distdir/  homedir/  image/  temp/  work/
> root@m-Gentoo-PC /h/maxik# ls /var/lib/layman/maxik-ebuilds/games-engines/unity3d/files/
> EULA                unity-editor*         unity-monodevelop.desktop  update-eula*
> monodevelop-unity*  unity-editor.desktop  unity-monodevelop.png

As you can see, no "files" dir is present. How can it be fixed?

likely you are using it wrong. try #gentoo-dev-help on freenode.
