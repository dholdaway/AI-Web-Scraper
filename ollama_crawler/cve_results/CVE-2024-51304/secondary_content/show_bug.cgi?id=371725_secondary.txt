Description

          2011-06-15 09:53:09 UTC
        

When I run media-gfx/freecad-0.11.3729, I get :

$ FreeCAD
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'
  what():  locale::facet::_S_create_c_locale name not valid
Abandon


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge freecad
2. run it : $ FreeCAD
Actual Results:  
as described earlier. The FreeCAD does not start.

Expected Results:  
Just work.

The correcting patch for boost is here : https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/attachment/ticket/4688/boost_filesystem.2.patch

Can't do anything on the freecad side, reassigning to boost maintainers.

I did not keep track of the version of boost when I opened this bug, but after upgrading, freecad builds and works fine, with the same version.
On my side, the bug is closed, though I cannot tell what have solved it.
