glibc erandom use flag doesn't work. From my check it hasn't worked for a long time now. ssp.c expects __SSP_USE_ERANDOM__ but configure gives HAVE_DEV_ERANDOM

is there any reason to check for /dev/erandom in the build environment? And is there a reason to use the sysctl interface (which isn't available if frandom is compiled/used as a module?)

The flag simply needs to be removed from future ebuilds. We don't want to support erandom.

it's already been removed ... it's only in 2.3.5/2.3.6 ebuilds which arent really supported anymore
