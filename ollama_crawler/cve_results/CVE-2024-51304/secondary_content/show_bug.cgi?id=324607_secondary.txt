Description

On unmerging net-snmp, the following error is displayed:

 * Deprecation Warning: Not passing of paths to python_mod_cleanup() is deprecated and will be
 * disallowed on 2010-09-01. Call python_mod_cleanup() with paths to Python modules.
 * The ebuild needs to be fixed. Please report a bug, if it has not been already reported.


The postrm function seems to attempt to pass a path of some sort to the routine in question.  This function is unchanged in the latest ebuild (r4).

pkg_postrm() {
	if use python; then
		python_mod_cleanup $(python_get_sitedir)/netsnmp
	fi
}

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Unmerge net-snmp




Currently selected python version is 2.6.  (3.1 is installed in a new slot.)
Python is in my USE flags.

This bug was fixed on 2010-06-01. During uninstallation, pkg_prerm() and pkg_postrm() from environment.bz2 in VDB, not from ebuild in Portage tree, are used.
