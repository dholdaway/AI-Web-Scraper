Description

While starting keychain I get the following warning;

* Warning: can't find B6DF94AA; skipping

Yet this is one of my keys;

[nicbrown@localhost ~]$ gpg --list-secret-keys
/home/nicbrown/.gnupg/secring.gpg
---------------------------------
sec   1024D/B6DF94AA 2003-10-06
uid                  Nicholas Brown <nicbrown@cisco.com>
ssb   1024g/D5FC972F 2003-10-06

sec   1024D/154D6026 2004-08-18
uid                  Nick Brown <nickbroon@blueyonder.co.uk>
ssb   1024g/7272358C 2004-08-18

looking in parse_mykeys() I see;

    for pm_k in "$@"; do
        # Check for ssh
        if wantagent ssh; then
            if [ -f "$pm_k" ]; then
                add_sshkey "$pm_k" ; continue
            elif [ -f "$HOME/.ssh/$pm_k" ]; then
                add_sshkey "$HOME/.ssh/$pm_k" ; continue
            elif [ -f "$HOME/.ssh2/$pm_k" ]; then
                add_sshkey "$HOME/.ssh2/$pm_k" ; continue
            fi
        fi

        # Check for gpg
        if wantagent gpg; then
            if [ -z "$pm_gpgsecrets" ]; then
                pm_gpgsecrets="`gpg --list-secret-keys 2>/dev/null | cut -d/
-f2 | cut -d' ' -f1 | xargs`"
                [ -z "$pm_gpgsecrets" ] && pm_gpgsecrets='/'    # arbitrary
            fi
            case " $pm_gpgsecrets " in *" $pm_k "*)
                add_gpgkey "$pm_k" ; continue ;;
            esac
        fi

        $ignoreopt || warn "can't find $pm_k; skipping"
        continue
    done

Running the gpg command I get;

[nicbrown@localhost ~]$ gpg --list-secret-keys 2>/dev/null | cut -d/ -f2 | cut
-d' ' -f1 | xargs
home --------------------------------- B6DF94AA uid D5FC972F 154D6026 uid
7272358C
[nicbrown@localhost ~]$

This looks strangish. Could this be related.
Can you identify the cause of this warning message?

I would mark this bug as closed unless it can be re-confirmed with 2.6.8+.

old bug, closing due to inactivity (and upstream maintainer CC'd on bug.) Re-open if necessary.
