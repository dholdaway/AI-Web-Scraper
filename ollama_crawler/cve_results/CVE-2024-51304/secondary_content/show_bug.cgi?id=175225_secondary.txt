Description

The module pw_kerberos.so is built from the contrib kerberos.c file as soon as the  "kerberos" useflag is set. This is done WITHOUT the -lkrb5 flag passed to gcc, leading to unresolved symbols in .so (e.g. krb5_init_context). slapd will crash as soon as a {KERBEROS} entry occurs in an ldap password field with an unresolved symbol error message. Recompiling the module with -lkrb5 fixes this problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Emerge openldap with useflag "kerberos"
2. Load the pw_kerberos.so module in slapd.conf
3. Authenticate against an ldap user with {KERBEROS} referenced password

Actual Results:  
slapd crashes with unresolved symbol "krb5_init_context" in pw_kerberos.so

Expected Results:  
Successful authentication against running kerberos server

Can you try to debug this one? There is a Makefile in the contrib dir that calls the C compiler... Please check if that lib is really missing as it seems to be specified there
