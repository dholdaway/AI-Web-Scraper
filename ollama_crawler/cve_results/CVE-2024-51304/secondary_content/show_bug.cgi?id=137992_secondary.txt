Sorry i dont know what the URL should be.  here's the homepage -->  http://www.goof.com/pcg/marc/root-tail.html

Well I had to install x11-misc/imake inorder for x11-terms/root-tail to install. 
But I see that x11-misc/imake is in the ebuild for  x11-terms/root-tail  but for some reason it didnt pull it in for me. I had to do it manually. I'm on Xorg 7.0-r1 if that has anything to do with it.

# equery b `which xmkmf`
[ Searching for file(s) /usr/bin/xmkmf in *... ]
x11-misc/imake-1.0.2 (/usr/bin/xmkmf)

DEPEND=">=sys-apps/sed-4
        || ( ( x11-misc/imake
                        app-text/rman
                        x11-misc/gccmakedep
                )
                virtual/x11
        )"

No missing dependency there, as you can see.
