The console displays the following message:

what the... it should not be there (the button) i will look to it at some point and fix it (but currently quite overwhelmed by preparing 4.0 release :-)), simply don't click it for now.

Anyway your gdb trace is still useless because you need to compile glibc with symbols too. (simple -g is enough)

Okey could you please verify the button is not present for 4.0.1.2?

Seems like it could be fixed :-)

Well i understood it wrong :-)
You are checking for extension updates, not for the app updates.

Anyway. This is heavily dependant of extensions you have installed at that moment.

Would you please create screenshot of the extensions window so I can try to replicate it?

Unable to reproduce with various extensions assigned. Feel free to reopen this bug at the point you provide the screenshot I asked before, or list of your extensions.
