pinkbyte@phantom ~/dev/gentoo-dev/gentoo-x86/app-i18n/man-pages-ru $ cvs up
pinkbyte@phantom ~/dev/gentoo-dev/gentoo-x86/app-i18n/man-pages-ru $ repoman full

RepoMan scours the neighborhood...

Note: use --include-dev (-d) to check dependencies for 'dev' profiles

RepoMan sez: "If everyone were like you, I'd be out of business!"

As you should know repoman checks for digests too.

So i suppose that this is out-of-sync event in mirroring and it should be fixed soon(in a few hours)
