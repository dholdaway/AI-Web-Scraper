version please bump. also patch 1.6.9 to #include <string.h> for gcc-4.4. note that hdf5-1.8.3 is out too and does not require patch for gcc-4.4. however it breaks packages like octave due to extensive changes.

Reproducible: Always

ebuild for 1.8.3. currently breaks octave.

File bump requests separately.  Its easier just to patch the existing one to make it compile with gcc-4.4 for the time being.

1.6.7 builds fine for me with gcc-4.4.  Please reopen with the build.log and emerge --info if you can reproduce.
