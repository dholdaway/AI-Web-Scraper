Thanks for the report! Maintainer added support for this module in 1.3.4_rc1, now in tree

So, after recheck ProFTPD documentation (http://www.proftpd.org/docs/contrib/mod_sql_sqlite.html#Usage) turn out that flag for this ebuild should be named sqlite3 not sqlite (and ebuild depend should be dev-db/sqlite:3)
Please execuse me my mistake.

Thanks for your lookup! While adding sqlite support to ProFTPD I also reviewed the documentation to get a proper list for it's dependencies. So ProFTPD 1.3.4rc1 already depends on dev-db/sqlite:3. I searched through the portage tree for the sqlite3 use-flag and most of these packages do have a sqlite use-flag for sqlite2 and a sqlite3 use-flag for sqlite3 support. On my local system all packages depending on sqlite3 are using the sqlite use-flag. Hence I think we should stick with it. Why do you think we should rename it?

Because SQLite engine used in ProFTPD is in version 3. It's proposal only. But good to be if all ebuilds have only sqlite use flag (and version of SQLite will be solve in RDEPEND). Any exception of special treatment of sqlite use flag should be when program used in ebuild provide 2 parallel versions of sqlite.

Indeed, the common USE-flag handling is to use "sqlite" as standard flag (specifying version if needed in depends). sqlite2/sqlite3 was only needed when both can be used, to specify which to use, and these days has almost disappeared as most programs can use sqlite3 now :)

So everything ok apart from that? (checking if this one is fixed for good)

Yes, everything is clear for me :-)
New ebuild version (1.3.4_rc1) build without errors under amd64 and ~amd64.
