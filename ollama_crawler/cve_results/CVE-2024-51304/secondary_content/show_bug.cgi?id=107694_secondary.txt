Description

Hi there,

I've written a new Ebuild for librote, which is a terminal emulation library. 
It's used by several programs already, for example: 

* Omnitty SSH Multiplexer [1]
* Anyterm Web Browser Terminal [2]

I'll file another bug for omnitty later on.

- einstall is an ugly workaround used for very broken Makefiles, better use 
"make DESTDIR="${D}" install" if possible
- the semicolons are superfluous
- inheriting eutils is not necessary

Should probably add "sys-libs/ncurses" to DEPENDS.
