/etc/init.d/glusterd stop does not stop the services started with /etc/init.d/glusterd start

I must manually kill them for the filesystem to stop.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1./etc/init.d/glusterd start
2./etc/init.d/glusterd stop
3. ps -ef | grep gluster
Actual Results:  
Most gluster processes remain running.

Expected Results:  
No gluster processes should be running

gluster 3.4.2
