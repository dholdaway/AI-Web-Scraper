Tripadvisor Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results
 
NEEDHAM, MA, February 14, 2024 — Tripadvisor, Inc. (Nasdaq: TRIP) (“Tripadvisor” or the “Company”) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
•Revenue for the fourth quarter was $390 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 10%. Revenue for the full year was $1,788 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 20%.
•Net income for the fourth quarter was $32 million, or $0.22 diluted EPS. Net income for the full year was $10 million, or $0.08 diluted EPS.
•Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $55 million, or $0.38 diluted EPS. Non-GAAP net income for the full year was $186 million, or $1.29 diluted EPS.
•Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $84 million, or 22% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $334 million, or 19% of revenue.
“We are pleased with our fiscal 2023 results. On a consolidated basis, our $1.8 billion revenue was an all time high for Tripadvisor Group, reflecting annual growth of 20%. In addition to growing our revenue more than 10% higher than our previous peak, we have diversified our portfolio, with experiences now delivering more than 40% of our revenue, as we continue to drive our transformation at Tripadvisor, market leadership at Viator, and profitable growth at TheFork,” said Chief Executive Officer Matt Goldberg. “During the year we made significant progress executing on our strategic goals at each of our brands, positioning us to build momentum as we begin the new fiscal year and fortify the important position we hold in travel and experiences.” 
“We exited the year with solid financial results, delivering fourth quarter revenue of $390 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 10%.  Adjusted EBITDA of $84 million, or 22% of revenue, came in better than expected due favorable channel mix and disciplined marketing spend,” said Chief Financial Officer Mike Noonan. “In 2024, we will continue to prioritize our segment strategies which focus on long-term growth and profitability.” 
The Company renamed its Tripadvisor Core segment to “Brand Tripadvisor,” and its “Display and Platform” revenue stream within the Brand Tripadvisor segment, to “Media and Advertising.” These nomenclature changes had no impact on the composition of our segments, revenue streams, or on any current or historic financial information.

 Inside Tripadvisor, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Public health-related events, such as a pandemic, political instability, geopolitical conflicts, including the evolving events in the Middle East, acts of terrorism, fluctuations in currency values, and changes in global economic conditions, are examples of other events that could have a negative impact on the travel industry, and as a result, our financial results in the future.
