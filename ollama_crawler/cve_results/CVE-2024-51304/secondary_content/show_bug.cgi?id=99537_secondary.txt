Description

It appears my CVS access has been disabled due to inactivity. I spoke to
robbat2, and he said I should open a bug and assign it to devrel. I would have
reopened my original dev bug, but I came in before that process was in place.
The main reason I need my CVS reactivated currently is so I can help with
tcpreplay maintenance (bug #99367). I've still been checking in on
-core/-dev/bugzilla/forums and hanging out on IRC, so I've kept up with some of
the gentoo goings-on. I just didn't have time for active development. I have
more time to devote to gentoo now, so I'd like to help out again. I'd be glad to
take the dev quizzes and the like. I came in before developers had to take the
quizzes, so it'd be good for me. By the way, all my other accounts are still
active (toucan(dev), email, bugzilla, -core, irc ops, etc.). My ssh pubkey is
still on toucan also.

Thanks,
Arun
