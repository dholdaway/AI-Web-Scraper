 Inside Kraft Heinz Co's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
This impact was partially offset by the impact of certain unfavorable items, primarily non-deductible goodwill impairments, the impact of the federal tax on GILTI, and the establishment of uncertain tax positions and valuation allowance reserves.



 Financial - Income   Highlight
Our 2023 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the geographic mix of pre-tax income in various non-U.S. jurisdictions.

 Legal - Other   Highlight
The year-over-year increase in the effective tax rate was due primarily to the decrease in deferred tax liabilities due to the merger of certain foreign entities and the revaluation of deferred tax balances due to changes in state tax laws in the prior year versus the current year.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
Our 2022 effective tax rate was impacted by the favorable geographic mix of pre-tax income in various non-U.S. jurisdictions and certain favorable items, primarily the decrease in deferred tax liabilities due to the merger of certain foreign entities, the revaluation of deferred tax balances due to changes in state tax laws, and changes in estimates of certain 2021 U.S. income and deductions.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
These impacts more than offset higher commodity costs, including the impact of realized and unrealized gains and losses on commodity hedges; higher supply chain costs, reflecting inflationary pressure in manufacturing and procurement costs; unfavorable volume/mix; increased selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”), particularly advertising expenses; and the decrease from lapping a 53rd week of shipments in the prior period.
