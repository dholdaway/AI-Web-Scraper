I have been attempting to review my submitted bugs.
I apparently the old request are not available.
I am most interested with:
  LiveCD/DVD boot time.
  Inability to select Keyboard during installation from the LiveCD/DVD disc.

You are probably only searching for open bugs. You can search for all bugs by adding "ALL" (all-caps) in front of your search query. For example:

https://bugs.gentoo.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=ALL%20reporter%3Afdan52%40comcast.net

There's a "My Bugs" link in the footer that should list your bugs.

Instead of filing bugs, please consult our bugzilla docs [1], or our community [2] for getting help with using the site.
