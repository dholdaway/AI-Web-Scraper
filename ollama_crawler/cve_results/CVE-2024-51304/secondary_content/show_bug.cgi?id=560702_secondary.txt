Please remove the deprecated SYNC setting from make.conf and let 

/usr/share/portage/config/repos.conf default to using

sync-type = git
sync-uri = https://github.com/gentoo-mirror/gentoo.git

/etc/portage/make.conf from stage3-amd64-20160114.tar.bz2

Seems to be solved as of stage3-amd64-20160114.tar.bz2
No line there with SYNC= any longer.
