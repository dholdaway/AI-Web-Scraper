 1 The following are non-GAAP financial
measures which Ally believes are important to the reader of the Consolidated Financial Statements, but which are supplemental to and not a substitute for GAAP measures: Accelerated issuance expense (Accelerated OID), Adjusted earnings per share
(Adjusted EPS), Adjusted efficiency ratio, Adjusted noninterest expense, Adjusted other revenue, Adjusted tangible book value per share (Adjusted TBVPS), Adjusted total net revenue, Core net income attributable to common shareholders, Core original
issue discount (Core OID) amortization expense, Core outstanding original issue discount balance (Core OID balance), Core pre-provision net revenue (Core PPNR), Core
pre-tax income, Core return on tangible common equity (Core ROTCE), Investment income and other (adjusted), Net financing revenue (excluding Core OID), Net interest margin (excluding Core OID), Pre-provision net revenue (PPNR), and Tangible Common Equity. These measures are used by management, and we believe are useful to investors in assessing the companys operating performance and capital. Refer to
the definitions of non-GAAP financial measures and other key terms along with reconciliations to GAAP later in this document. 

 
The following information was filed by Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) on Friday, January 19, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.
