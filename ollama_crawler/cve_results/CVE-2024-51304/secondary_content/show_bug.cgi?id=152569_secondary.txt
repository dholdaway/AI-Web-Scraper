Description

After turning debugging on, the error is:
"vmxvmdb: Index name being generated from config file
POST(no connection): Version mismatch with vmmon module: expecting 138.0, got 137.0.
You have an incorrect version of the `vmmon' kernel module.
Try reinstalling VMware Server."

This is after purging out all of the old files and then re-installing.

As a side note, /opt/vmware/lib/bin-debug/vmware-vmx needs to be setuid root. This had to be done by hand before I could get as far as the above error message.

vmware-server version? vmware-modules version? Did you re-emerge vmware-modules? Did you get any errors during re-emerge?

vmware-server version 1.0.1-2996-r1, vmware-modules 1.0.0.15-r1, yes, I did re-emerge it and I saw no errors.

Well, you have some junk coming from overlay. Work just fine here.
