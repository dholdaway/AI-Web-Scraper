net-dns/ddclient-3.7.3-r1 works fine. 
net-dns/ddclient-3.8.0 (even with the ddclient-iproute2.patch) do not work.

grep ddclient /var/log/messages
ddclient[16470]: FAILED:   updating <C>.dyndns.org: badauth: Bad authorization (username or password)

i used https://www.dyndns.com/account/resetpass/ to get a new password, but it did not help. 

i use for booth versions /etc/ddclient/ddclient.conf
daemon=300
syslog=yes
mail=root
mail-failure=root
ssl=yes
use=web, web=checkip.dyndns.org
protocol=dyndns2, login=<A>, password=<B>, mx=<C>.dyndns.org <C>.dyndns.org

<A>, <B>, <C> is my private stuff.

I tried to delete /var/cache/ddclient/ddclient.cache too.

I haven't spent muhc time looking, but I use ddclient 3.8.0 with my setup and dyndns and it works ok.

I can't reproduce this issue.

Over two years after reporting, I tried 
  net-dns/ddclient-3.8.1-r3
and this version finally works. 

The reason for the "badauth" in 2009 will be unclear forever ;-)
Perhaps iproute issue, perhaps a configuration problem in ddclient.conf.
