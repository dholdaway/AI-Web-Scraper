Feel free to change the summary at your convenience.

Issue: dev-ada/xmlada does not respect CFLAGS.
Discovered on: amd64

NOTE:
To reproduce this issue you may want to add "-frecord-gcc-switches" to CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS/FFLAGS/FCFLAGS. If this is not something about c/c++ context see this bug as an hint to hide the QA warning (with QA_FLAGS_IGNORED) where is not possible to respect CFLAGS.
