Description


Michael





          2007-03-15 12:02:29 UTC
        

Since updating dbus from 0.6* to 1.0.2-r1 and following reemerge of wpa_supplicant with dbus USE flag turned on wpa_supplicant won't connect to my access point.
After turning dbus USE-flag off and reemerge of wpa_supplicant everything works again.
So I think wpa_supplicant and dbus 1.* maybe incompatible. I tested dbus support with wpa_supplicant-0.5.7 and 0.5.4.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Turn use-flag "dbus" on for net-wireless/wpa_supplicant
2. emerge net-wireless/wpa_supplicant
3. Try to connect to a access point (tested with WPA-PSK secured one and an unsecured one)

Actual Results:  
Failed to connect to the access point.

Expected Results:  
Should successfully connect to the access point.

I can confirm this behaviour on PPC too.

Could you attach your `emerge --info` too please?

BTW, I'm not seeing this myself on either FreeBSD nor Linux. However, both systems are ~ARCH and neither talk to a WPA enabled AP, just WEP and unsecured.

It only happens if the AP uses WPA. I unset the encryption on my AP and everything worked.

Can't reproduce this w/ WPA-PSK and rt2x00 (rt2500pci) driver.

Re-open if you still have this with wpa_supplicant-0.5.8 and 0.6.0
