Here's the emerge output - I've tried deleting the file and downloading it again:

>>> checking miscfile checksums
>>> checking distfiles checksums
!!! Digest verification failed:

Please, delete the file and try again, should be already fixed.

I've just resynced and re-downloaded the file. From viewcvs the digest file I have is that one that CHTEKK recommitted 13 hours ago, but the file doesn't match that digest.

I just checked again, the digests are correct. Maybe your mirror doesn't have the updated php-patchset-4.4.2-r3.tar.bz2 yet? It was changed yesterday cause it contained an error, make sure it has the md5sum of eac1d9e4aa78195953e33e566a1f39ce and, if not, download it from http://gentoo.longitekk.com/php-patchset-4.4.2-r3.tar.bz2 that's the primary mirror for them.
Best regards, CHTEKK.

Ah, looks like the mirrors I downloaded it from were out of date then. Sorry about that!
