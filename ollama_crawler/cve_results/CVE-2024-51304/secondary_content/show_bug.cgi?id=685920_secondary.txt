As the maintainer of net-misc/seafile I would like to point you to the discussion on the debian-legal mailing list relating to this package: https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2019/05/msg00002.html

Please review the information provided and comment on its applicability to Gentoo.

I'd like to refer to my answer in https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=928975#17:

> Dear all,

and Gentoo. ;-)

and Gentoo. ;-)

I reopen after reading the ticket
https://github.com/haiwen/seafile/issues/666

Upstream was not very responsible about the license violation. 
The "solutions" on the bug tracker are alarming.
We should either look into the files in a short audit, or tree clean the package.

There is a untraceable mix of licenses, forks and old, bundled libs in the upstream tree. Software like this can be very dangerous, if it is unmaintained in our tree. A look on the open bugs and the way license violations are handled motivates me rather to treeclean.

So, how are we going to proceed here? Reading the last comment of the linked Debian bug https://bugs.debian.org/928975#47 makes me cringe:

| I am very uncomfortable with having code in Debian whose upstream
| authors appear to have plagiarised some other people's software, and
| then obfuscated it, in order to evade copyright licensing.  Who knows
| what other misleading practices they have engaged in, or may do in the
| future ?
| 
| As a project, we do not have the resources to fully audit all the code
| we ingest from upstreams and redistribute to our users.  We must rely
| on trust.  That depends on the upstream being trustworthy.

To me it looks like the situation is everything else than resolved.

IIUC both net-misc/seafile and net-misc/seafile-client are part of the client code, and the versions in the tree don't contain any of the offending code.

Closing for now. Still, I have an uneasy feeling about that upstream, see previous comments and links in there.
