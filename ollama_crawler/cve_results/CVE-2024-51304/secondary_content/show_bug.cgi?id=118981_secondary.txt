whenever you upgrade a library that says "run revdep-rebuild" at the end of it's emerge info, you actually do need to follow that instruction otherwise you get that as your error msg. Or something similar.

the problem with that information is, that it's usually gone after a few seconds and i don't see those messages each and every time, because most of the time i don't watch my pc emerging. escpecially, if there's a lot of packages to upgrade.
