The "volume normalization" feature depends on "mp3gain"
or -- if aac support is needed which is quite likely --
on "aacgain".

For the only version (-1.5) of "aacgain" that is
available in portage is "~x86", RDEPEND on "aacgain"
should be "guarded" by IUSE "aac", I think.

  aac?  ( >= media-sound/aacgain )
  !aac? ( >= media-sound/mp3gain)

I've just noticed that "gtkpod" isn't able to handle
the "replaygain" tags for mp4/aac files, though
"aacgain" seems to be able to handle/set them.

So, RDEPEND-ing on "accgain" does not make
any sense at the moment, while RDEPEND-ing
on "mp3gain" seems to be correct.

well.. its not necessary for the proper operation of gtkpod, that's why I dont depend on it, I can even guess that very few people use it.. I could probably add a einfo() message about it.

OK by me, i. e. do whatever seems to be appropriate
and close the bug.
I've filed it, because I thought that this runtime
dependency has been overlooked. :-)
