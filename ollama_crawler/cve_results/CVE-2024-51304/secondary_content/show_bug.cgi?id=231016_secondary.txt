Description


Pavel Stratil





          2008-07-07 01:47:04 UTC
        

ebuild contains 

pkg_setup() {
	# need python threads (see bug #224269)
	if ! built_with_use dev-lang/python threads; then
		die "hippodraw needs dev-lang/python with USE=\"threads\""
	fi
}

... the treads are on by default in python 2.5, disabled by 'nothreads' flag (unlike 2.4 where treads were off and had to be enabled by using 'threads' use flag)

Reproducible: Always

All current python ebuilds have changed to 'threads'. Please, sync and upgrade your Python.
