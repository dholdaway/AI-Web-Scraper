“Our fiscal 2024 results were among the best in the company’s history, clearly benefiting from our actions to transform Modine and drive sustainable margin improvement,”
      said Modine President and Chief Executive Officer, Neil D. Brinker. “We delivered another year of record sales and adjusted EBITDA, led by our data center business with revenues increasing 69 percent from the prior year. Performance Technologies
      showed tremendous improvement, with gross margin increasing by 600 basis points to 20 percent in the fourth quarter and delivering a gross margin of 18.2 percent for the fiscal year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.1 percent in fiscal 2024 was
      comfortably above the high end of the 10 to 12 percent range we laid out at our 2022 Investor Day. We continue to track ahead of those initial expectations and expect these improvements to continue into fiscal 2025.”

Fourth Quarter Financial Results
 
Net sales decreased 2 percent to $603.5 million, compared with $618.1 million in the prior year, including a $24.2 million impact from businesses divested in the third
      fiscal quarter. Organic sales were flat compared with the prior year.
 
Gross profit increased 21 percent to $135.3 million and gross margin improved by 420 basis points to 22.4 percent, primarily due to the benefits from ongoing 80/20
      initiatives, higher average selling prices, lower material costs and favorable sales mix.
 
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased $14.7 million to $75.6 million. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation-related expenses,
      including higher incentive compensation driven by improved financial results and acquisition and integration costs.
 
Operating income was $46.8 million, compared to $48.5 million in the prior year. The decrease was driven by higher SG&A and restructuring expenses as compared to the
      prior year, partially offset by higher gross profit. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company recorded $12.9 million of restructuring expenses, primarily related to targeted headcount reductions to reduce overhead costs by consolidating
      technical services, and $4.1 million of acquisition and integration costs. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company recorded $2.8 million of restructuring expenses, and environmental charges of $0.4 million. Adjusted EBITDA, which
      excludes restructuring expenses, certain other charges, and depreciation and amortization expense, was $78.8 million, an increase of $13.3 million, or 20 percent, compared with $65.5 million in the prior year. 
 
Earnings per share was $0.48, compared with $1.69 in the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to the reversal of a tax valuation allowance in the prior year. 
      Adjusted earnings per share was $0.77, compared with adjusted earnings per share of $0.67 in the prior year. This improvement of $0.10, or 15 percent, was primarily driven by higher gross profit.
 
Fourth Quarter Segment Review
 





 

•


Climate Solutions segment sales were $264.5 million, compared with $263.0 million one year ago, an increase of 1 percent. This increase was driven by higher sales of data center cooling products including
                    the impact from the acquisition of Scott Springfield Manufacturing on March 1, 2024, partially offset by lower sales of heat transfer products. The segment reported gross margin of 25.9 percent, which was 270 basis points higher than
                    the prior year, primarily due to favorable sales mix and improved operating efficiencies. The segment reported operating income of $39.2 million, a 15 percent increase from the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $47.5 million, an increase
                    of $5.7 million, or 14 percent, from the prior year.






 





 

•


Performance Technologies segment sales were $344.4 million, compared with $364.1 million one year ago, a decrease of 5 percent. Excluding the impact of divestitures, organic sales grew 2 percent. This
                    increase primarily resulted from higher sales to off-highway and specialty vehicle customers partially offset by lower sales to automotive customers. The segment reported gross margin of 20.0 percent, up 600 basis points from the prior
                    year. The segment reported operating income of $26.6 million, a $2.1 million improvement compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher gross profit partially offset by higher SG&A and restructuring expenses as compared to the
                    prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $46.1 million, an increase of $12.8 million, or 38 percent, from the prior year.






 
Full-Year Financial Results
 
Net sales increased 5 percent to $2,407.8 million. The increase was driven by higher sales in both segments, with particularly strong gains in sales of data center
      products. Gross margin increased 490 basis points to 21.8 percent, primarily due to higher average selling prices, lower material costs, and improved operating efficiencies, partially offset by higher labor and inflationary costs, as compared to the
      prior year.

The Company reported operating income of $240.7 million compared to $150.4 million in the prior year, an improvement of $90.3 million, or 60 percent. During fiscal 2024,
      the Company recorded a $4.0 million gain on the sale of German automotive businesses, $15.0 million in restructuring expenses, and $6.5 million of other charges including acquisition-related costs and environmental charges. During fiscal 2023, the
      Company recorded restructuring expenses and other charges totaling $7.2 million. Excluding these items and depreciation and amortization expense, adjusted EBITDA was $314.3 million in fiscal 2024 and $212.1 million in fiscal 2023, an improvement of
      $102.2 million, or 48%. Earnings per share in fiscal 2024 was $3.03 compared with $2.90 in fiscal 2023, and adjusted earnings per share in fiscal 2024 was $3.25, compared with $1.95 in fiscal 2023.
 
Balance Sheet & Liquidity
 
Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2024 was $214.6 million, an increase of $107.1 million compared to the prior year. Free cash flow for
      the year ended March 31, 2024 was $126.9 million, an improvement of $70.1 million from the prior year, primarily resulting from higher operating earnings and favorable net changes in working capital as compared to the prior year. Cash payments for
      restructuring activities, acquisition and integration costs, environmental costs and certain other items during the year ended March 31, 2024 totaled $14.2 million.
 
Total debt was $431.6 million as of March 31, 2024. Cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2024 were $60.1 million. Net debt was $371.5 million as of March 31, 2024, an
      increase of $85.9 million from the end of fiscal 2023.  This increase was primarily due to incremental borrowings to fund the acquisition of Scott Springfield Manufacturing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, partially offset by free cash flow
      generated throughout fiscal 2024.
 
Outlook
 
“Our strong fiscal 2024 results and the redeployment of capital to our highest return opportunities provide momentum as we enter fiscal 2025,” added Brinker. “The Climate
      Solutions segment will continue to leverage revenue growth in our targeted markets, along with the benefit of our most recent acquisition of Scott Springfield Manufacturing. Supported by a strong backlog and pipeline, we are adding additional data
      center manufacturing capacity in the US, Canada and in the UK to ensure that we can meet demand from our customers in the future. Our Performance Technologies segment will remain focused on driving favorable changes in the mix of revenue, resulting
      in higher margins and earnings. Overall, we expect revenue growth to be driven by continued strength in the data center market and growth in other targeted markets, partially offset by lower sales resulting from the impact of Performance Technologies
      divestitures and other planned reductions. We expect further margin improvements in both segments as we leverage 80/20 to focus our investments, improve our sales mix, and increase our operational efficiency. I am proud of what this team has
      accomplished, and am confident that our strategies will result in further improvements as we work to meet our commitments and reach our goals.”

Non-GAAP Financial Disclosures
 
Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted earnings per share, net debt, free cash flow, organic sales and organic sales growth (which are defined below) as used in
      this press release are not measures that are defined in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP measures are used by management as performance measures to evaluate the Company’s overall financial performance and liquidity.
      These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for the applicable GAAP measures, and may be different from similarly-titled measures used by other companies.
 
Definition – Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin
 
The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as net earnings excluding interest expense, the provision or benefit for income taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses, other
      income and expense, restructuring expenses, acquisition and integration costs, and certain other gains or charges.  Adjusted EBITDA margin represents adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales. The Company believes that adjusted EBITDA and adjusted
      EBITDA margin provide relevant measures of profitability and earnings power. The Company views these financial metrics as being useful in assessing operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that it believes are not
      representative of its core business. Adjusted EBITDA, when calculated for the business segments, is defined as GAAP operating income excluding depreciation and amortization expenses, restructuring expenses, and certain other gains or charges.
 
Definition – Adjusted earnings per share
 
Diluted earnings per share plus restructuring expenses, acquisition and integration costs, and excluding changes in income tax valuation allowances and certain other gains
      or charges. Adjusted earnings per share is an overall performance measure, not including costs associated with restructuring and acquisitions and certain other gains or charges.
 
Definition – Net debt
 
The sum of debt due within one year and long-term debt, less cash and cash equivalents. Net debt is an indicator of the Company’s debt position after considering on-hand
      cash balances.
 
Definition – Free cash flow
 
Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less expenditures for property, plant and equipment. Free cash flow presents cash generated from
      operations during the period that is available for strategic capital decisions.
 

5




Definition – Organic sales and organic sales growth
 
Net sales and net sales growth can be impacted by acquisitions, dispositions, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.  The Company defines
        organic sales as external net sales excluding the impact of acquisitions and the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.  Organic sales growth represents the percentage change of organic sales compared to prior year external net
        sales, excluding the impact of dispositions.  The effect of exchange rate changes is calculated by using the same foreign currency exchange rates as those used to translate financial data for the prior period.  The Company adjusts for acquisitions
        and dispositions by excluding net sales in the current and prior periods, respectively, for which there are no comparable sales in the reported periods.  These sales growth measures provide a more consistent indication of our performance, without
        the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations or acquisitions and dispositions.

      Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures
 
The Company’s fiscal 2025 guidance includes adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share, as defined above, which are non-GAAP financial measures. The full-year fiscal
      2025 guidance includes the Company’s estimates for interest expense of approximately $28 to $30 million, a provision for income taxes of approximately $64 to $68 million, and depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $80 to $84 million.
      The non-GAAP financial measures also exclude certain cash and non-cash expenses or gains. These expenses and gains may be significant and include items such as restructuring expenses (including severance costs and plant consolidation and relocation
      expenses), acquisition and integration costs, impairment charges and certain other items.  Beyond a $1.6 million inventory purchase accounting adjustment related to the acquisition of Scott Springfield Manufacturing, which we expect to charge to cost
      of sales during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, estimates of these expenses and gains for fiscal 2025 are not available due to the low visibility and unpredictability of these items.

(a)


Restructuring expenses primarily consist of employee severance expenses related to targeted headcount reductions and equipment transfer costs. The
                    restructuring expenses recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 primarily relate to severance expenses associated with the pending closure of a technical service center in Europe within the Performance Technologies segment. The
                    tax benefit related to restructuring expenses during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 was $0.5 million and $0.3 million, respectively. The tax benefit related to restructuring expenses during fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023
                    was $1.0 million and $0.6 million, respectively.










(b)


The Company’s sale of three automotive businesses based in Germany closed on October 31, 2023. As a result of the sale, the Company recorded a $4.0 million
                    gain on sale at Corporate during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The tax benefit associated with the sale totaled $3.1 million.










(c)


On March 1, 2024, the Company acquired Scott Springfield Manufacturing, a leading provider of air handling units for the data center, telecommunications,
                    healthcare, and aerospace markets. In addition, the Company purchased liquid immersion cooling technology from TMGcore, Inc. in January 2024. Acquisition and integration costs in fiscal 2024, recorded as SG&A expenses at Corporate,
                    primarily include fees for i) transaction advisors, ii) legal, accounting, and other professional services, and iii) incremental costs directly associated with integration activities. In addition, the adjustment includes $1.6 million,
                    also recorded at Corporate, for the impact of an inventory purchase accounting adjustment. The Company wrote up acquired inventory to its estimated fair value and is charging the write-up to cost of sales as the underlying inventory is
                    sold. The tax benefit related to the acquisition related costs and adjustments for fiscal 2024 was $0.8 million.










(d)


Environmental charges, including related legal costs, are recorded as SG&A expenses at Corporate and relate to a previously-owned U.S. manufacturing
                    facility. The tax benefit related to environmental charges during fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 was $0.6 million and $0, respectively.










(e)


In fiscal 2023, the Company amended and extended its primary debt agreement in the U.S. In connection with the credit agreement modification, the Company
                    recorded $0.7 million of costs as interest expense during the third quarter of fiscal 2023. There was no tax benefit associated with these costs.










(f)


During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company reversed the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets in the U.S. As a result, the Company
                    recorded an income tax benefit of $57.3 million.
