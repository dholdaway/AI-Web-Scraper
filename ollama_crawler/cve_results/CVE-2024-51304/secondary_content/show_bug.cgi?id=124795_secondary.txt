The mirror at mirrors.acm.cs.rpi.edu used to be very fast--at least as fast as my 8.0 Mbps connection. Now suddenly it's very slow--not even 50 kbps. It's been this way for a couple of days now.

Omari,

I'm downloading a file from there right now that is holding at about 300KB/sec. Might check something on your end.
