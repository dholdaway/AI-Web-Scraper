mediatomb patch to fix problem with recent Samsung TVs

Recent Samsung TVs are broken and send an invalid request to mediatomb. The attached patch is a workaround for this bug.

The attached patch is just a rediff of the patch attached to the following thread on sourceforge:

http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3532724&group_id=129766&atid=715782

It would be nice to have it included (temporarily until Samsung fix their act) under an appropriate USE flag (e.g. samsungfix).
