Description

When built with USE="-headless -qt4" virtualbox doesn't build the GUI.
As far as I'm aware the qt4 use flag should enable/disable optional qt4 use rather than disabling the GUI entirely.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

As far as I know there's no other gui than the qt4 one.

True but there's a perfectly good "headless" flag for building without it and "qt4" is described as preferring qt4 over other GUIs.

Disabling headless does not automatically imply you want the qt4 gui frontend-- VM's can be created/managed via VBoxManage then started locally with VBoxSDL, for instance.  Not headless, but not the qt4 gui, either.  Please re-open if you still see any problems here.

Thanks!
