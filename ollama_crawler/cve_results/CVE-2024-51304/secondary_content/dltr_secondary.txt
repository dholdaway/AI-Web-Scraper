 Inside Dollar Tree Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Any impairment charges that we may take in the future could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.



 Other - Other   Highlight
A more frequent evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Management’s estimate for self-insurance liabilities could vary from the ultimate loss sustained given the difficulty in predicting future events; however, historically, the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
In addition, we recorded $80.6 million of inventory markdowns and $5.6 million of capitalized distribution cost impairment within “Cost of sales” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the stores expected to close in the first half of fiscal 2024.

 Other - Other   Highlight
We believe that the assumptions, estimates and rates used in our fiscal 2023 impairment evaluations are reasonable; however, variations in the assumptions, estimates and rates could result in significantly different estimates of fair value.
