output of emerge --info

I have been trying to get mesa-10.1.0 to install with the latest llvm-9999 live build. I found a patch for the first error, but that was just a change of /usr/include/llvm/Linker/linker.h to /usr/include/llvm/Linker/Linker/linker.h but now I get this error.

I have tried to look on the freedesktop.org site for another patch but it seems i am the only one with this issue, or else everyone knows how to fix it except me.

Any help would be appreciated

Probably a fleeting compatibility issue with llvm.
