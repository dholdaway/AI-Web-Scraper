Description

Since today there's a blocker between glibc and libnsl, i can't fix:
[blocks B     ] <sys-libs/glibc-2.26 ("<sys-libs/glibc-2.26" is blocking net-libs/libnsl-1.1.0-r1)

It reaches my tree because of the deps kmymoney->libofx->opensp->libnsl


I kinda suspect it's related to #636158, but I can't find how to solve this.

It looks like glib-2.26 provides another implementation of "libnsl" ? Shouldn't there be a 'virtual' then for handling those blockers ?

You can resolve this by upgrading to glibc-2.26. If that's not working, please seek help in a support channel (not bugzilla).
