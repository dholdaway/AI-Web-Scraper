I don't see this, either on amd64 or on x86, either stable or ~.

I am now unable to reproduce this, too, but apparently I'm not the only one that was experiencing it (see posted url).

Check out for clock skew messages. I just got the same error and also got warnings about the mtimes of files in /usr/lib/gcc/i686-pc-linux-gnu/3.4.5/include/ being in the future. After doing a touch /usr/lib/gcc/i686-pc-linux-gnu/3.4.5/include/* the problem disappeared. Weird.

The next ~arch portage revision will auto repair evil rpaths and not bail. 
Maintainers should still fix the packages they maintain as portage will only die
with FEATURES=stricter (but that is a maintainer & QA problem) no longer security@

No longer a security issue with current stable portage, re-assigning to maintainer.

Can't see the problem either with 0.6.0 nor 0.6.1
