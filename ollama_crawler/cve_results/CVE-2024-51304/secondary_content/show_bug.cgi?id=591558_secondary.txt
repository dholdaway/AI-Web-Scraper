Description

compiled for x86 using i686 tarball.


Initially it produced this output:
<Will add to second comment>




Added this line to my chroot setup as advised on the web:
"mount --bind /run  /root/livecd/source/run"
and it produced this result:
(chroot) hal3 / # grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
Generating grub configuration file ...
done

But not the properly generated files needed for booting.

COMMAND: "grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg" 

PRODUCES: 
Generating grub configuration file ...
Found linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-4.4.6-gentoo
Found initrd image: /boot/initramfs-genkernel-x86-4.4.6-gentoo
  /run/lvm/lvmetad.socket: connect failed: No such file or directory
  WARNING: Failed to connect to lvmetad. Falling back to internal scanning.
done


Did not produce the expected boot files in /boot partition so I suppose the error cut the processing short.

I am trying to regenerate the /boot partition from an existing OS installation.

Thanks,
Ken Busse

That's a warning, not an error. Please seek help in support channels.
