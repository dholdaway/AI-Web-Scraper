Description

The handbook implies that there are a number of different installation CDs; however, it discuses only one: "The Minimal Installation CD."  There is no mention of a "maximal installation cd" or any other kind of CD.

===

From section 2.b:
"The Minimal Installation CD is called install-amd64-minimal-<release>.iso..."

From section 2.c:
"We previously discussed the several available Installation CDs..."

===

The handbook does mention something called a "stage 3 tarball" but this appears to not be a "installation cd" .iso, rather it is a .tar.gz file.

===

In particular, the minimal installation CD requires an internet connection.  I was looking for an alternative installation CD that does not require an internet connection, but could not find one.

What are my Options?

You can install Gentoo in many different ways. You can download and install from one of our Installation CDs, from a distribution already installed, from a non-Gentoo bootable CD (such as Knoppix), from a netbooted environment, from a rescue floppy, etc. 

This document covers the installation using a Gentoo Installation CD or, in certain cases, netbooting. This installation assumes that you want to install the latest available version of each package. 

Note: For help on the other installation approaches, including using non-Gentoo CDs, please read our Alternative Installation Guide. 
 

If you want to perform a networkless installation, you should read the Gentoo 2008.0 Handbooks which contain the installation instructions for a networkless environment. 

Also note that, if you plan on using GRP (the Gentoo Reference Platform, a collection of prebuilt packages meant for immediate use after a Gentoo installation), you must follow the instructions in the Gentoo 2008.0 Handbooks. 

We also provide a Gentoo Installation Tips & Tricks document that might be useful to read as well. If you are an experienced Gentoo user and just need a brief installation checklist, feel free to use our Quick Installation Guide available from our Documentation Resources if your architecture has such a document available. 

You also have several possibilities: you can compile your entire system from scratch or use a prebuilt environment to have your Gentoo environment up and running in no time. And of course you have intermediate solutions in which you don't compile everything but start from a semi-ready system.

trogdog has it right. this is info already in the handbooks.

it hasn't been possible for a few years to perform a networkless installation, since those standalone CDs haven't been reliably generated.
