Fourth Quarter 2023 Summary(1)(2)(3)
•Total reported sales of $1.8 billion, down 14% versus the prior year on a reported basis, or down 9% when eliminating the $128 million favorable impact related to the 53rd week included in the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease in reported sales is largely related to lower sales in its Office Depot consumer division, primarily due to 64 fewer retail locations in service compared to the previous year, as well as reduced retail and online consumer traffic and transactions
•GAAP operating loss includes non-cash asset impairment charges of $68 million related to goodwill at Varis, which led to a GAAP operating loss of $31 million and net loss from continuing operations of $37 million, or $(0.99) per diluted share. This result compares to GAAP operating income of $55 million and net income from continuing operations of $36 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, in the prior year. GAAP operating income results in the prior year period included the favorable impact related to the 53rd week of $20 million
