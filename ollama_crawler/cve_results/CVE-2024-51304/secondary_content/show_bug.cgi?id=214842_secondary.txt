Description

After some cable-in, cable-out events, ifplugd seems to get "stuck" and does not deactivate the interface anymore. 

Trying to manually remove eth0 

bellini ~ # /etc/init.d/net.eth0 stop
 * Stopping eth0
 *   Bringing down eth0
 *     Stopping ifplugd on eth0 ...                                       [ !! ]

-> in /var/log/messages
Mar 26 11:22:40 bellini ifplugd(eth0)[5819]: Killing child.
(and nothing else interesting)

leads to a zombie process (ps ax output):

 5819 ?        Ss     0:02 /usr/sbin/ifplugd --iface=eth0
29467 ?        Z      0:00 [ifplugd.action] <defunct>

The only way I found to resolve this was a reboot.

The network adapter is a tg3 (built-in, not module).

The effect has been reproduced 2-3 times at irregular intervals (typically after a week or so), with kernels 2.6.24.2 and 2.6.24-gentoo-r3. I'll add more information here when this re-occurs and I find anything interesting.

Additional note - it seems the bug occurs when
* the notebook is connected to ethernet,
* suspended to ram 
* and wakes up without cable...

It seems like this went away with a kernel update. Not sure which one, but
the problem has not occurred for months. 

I'm marking this resolved since there is no need to act on this bug report anymore.
