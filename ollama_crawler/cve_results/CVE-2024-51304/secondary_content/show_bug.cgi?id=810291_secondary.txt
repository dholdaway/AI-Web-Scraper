Created attachment 735887 [details]
emerge --info and build log

Emerge fails to build abv. package 
failing with I/O error : Attempt to load network entity .oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.4/docbookx.dtd
Seems to be a dependency error. app-text/docbook-xml-dtd is not puled in which is needed. 
 I had to remove www due to new user url rules.

So the current dbus ebuild already has app-text/docbook-xml-dtd:4.4 in BDEPEND.

Please post the output of the following command to this bug:

  qlist -CIS docbook-xml

The "qlist" command belongs to app-portage/portage-utils package.

qlist -CIS docbook-xml 
app-text/docbook-xml-dtd:4.5
app-text/docbook-xml-dtd:4.4
app-text/docbook-xml-dtd:4.3
app-text/docbook-xml-dtd:4.2
app-text/docbook-xml-dtd:4.1.2

Does the error still appear after you have re-emerged

  app-text/docbook-xml-dtd:4.4

package?

No after emerge --ask app-text/docbook-xml-dtd  dbus built with no complaints.
