Description

Hi all,

I have an old key, which back in 2001 was strong.  Today it is weak.  I should probably generate a new one.  Before I do, I want to make sure that I proceed correctly.  Here's what I'm thinking:

1) Generate a new 4096/rsa key.  Identity would be Anthony G. Basile <blueness@gentoo.org> same as my old key --- not sure if this will be a conflict but I'll find out.  Generated the revocation key etc.  Store it in a vault guarded by Orcs.

2) Sign the new key with my old key.  Sign the old key with the new key.

3) Push it out to pgp.mit.edu and other public key servers.

4) Test.

5) Email infra my new pub key and have them install it.  (Or can I do that myself via our ldap?  Or can we have two keys at once for our accounts?)

Any help here would be appreciated.

You install it yourself. You can have as many keys in LDAP as you want.
You don't need infra at all.

Here's what I get when I try to access ldap:

blueness@woodpecker ~ $ perl_ldap -b blueness -s blueness
Enter LDAP Password: 

Invalid credentials at /usr/local/bin/perl_ldap line 135


Our convseration in IRC:

<blueness> _robbat2|irssi, idl0r any idea why my passwd is *not* working for perl_ldap -b on woodpecker, even though it *does* work when i change my passwd with "passwd"?

<_robbat2|irssi> there was a UTF-8 encoding bug recently


Is there a workaround for now before this is fix?

perl_ldap -b user not perl_ldap -b $USER
