bobolink's rsyncd mirror doesn't seem to be working, but the box responds to pings and nmap -P0 -p 873 says the port is open.

Well, it works for me:

$ rsync rsync://bobolink.gentoo.org/gentoo-portage/

Are you using ipv6 or ipv4?

I'm using IPv4.

server mattst88 # emerge --sync

>>> Starting rsync with rsync://140.211.166.189/gentoo-portage/...

Running just rsync rsync://bobolink.gentoo.org/gentoo-portage/ works. So, some kind of user error?

/etc/portage/make.conf contains

SYNC="rsync://bobolink.gentoo.org/gentoo-portage/"

Matt, can you try from a different location? For us it seems, that it works from everywhere, so please make sure there is no problem. I advice using tcpdump to verify your network works fine.

It works from different networks. It must be a problem specific to my network.
