Description

I don't know about other versions, but with gentoo-sources-2.6.18-r5,
my attempt to "make headers_install" failed quickly with

treat linux # make headers_install
  CHK     include/linux/version.h
make: unifdef: Command not found
make: *** [headers_install] Error 127

I was doing this just to see what it was, but it seems to me if it
appears in the output of "make help" it ought to work better than this.

I'm omitting "emerge --info", expecting it to be immaterial.  The
kernel should be pretty much self-contained.  I am running a completely
current stable x86.

emerge dev-util/unifdef if you really need to do this...
