Description

when trying to load the rlocate module with gentoo-sources-2.6.14-r5, the following errors appear in dmesg:

rlocate: Unknown symbol class_simple_device_add
rlocate: Unknown symbol class_simple_destroy
rlocate: Unknown symbol class_simple_device_remove
rlocate: Unknown symbol class_simple_create

my kernel configuration is ok, according to the kernel configuration section
of the rlocate homepage (http://rlocate.sourceforge.net/#kernel_configuration).

reinstalling rlocate to rebuild the module doesn't work.

this error can be reproduced with gentoo-sources-2.6.14-r5 (2.6.13-r3 
revealed the same behaviour at my machine) by 
1. emerge rlocate
2. modprobe rlocate (error)
3. dmesg | grep rlocate (displays the error messages from above)

emergeing rlocate-0.3.3 fails with the following error:

 * Installing rlocate module

!!! ERROR: sys-apps/rlocate-0.3.3 failed.
!!! Function src_install, Line 45, Exitcode 0
!!! (no error message)
!!! If you need support, post the topmost build error, NOT this status message.

using rlocate-0.3.2 however works fine, the module is registered as expected.
