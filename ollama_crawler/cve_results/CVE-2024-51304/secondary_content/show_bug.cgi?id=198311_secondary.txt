This bug has been fixed upstream, at http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5112.  Is it possible to get a stable ebuild that includes this patch sometime soon?  2.7 has the fix, but will it be stable anytime soon?

Reproducible: Always

I've put unscd into my portage overlay which might be of interest:
http://svn.hurikhan.ath.cx/gentoo/trunk/sys-libs/unscd/

It's a redesigned implementation immune to most issues causing the nscd bugs. I'm currently test-running it on my machines.

yeah, i'd use unscd or just wait for glibc-2.8 that's going to stable

With apologies in advance for being pedantic, but shouldn't this be closed with WONTFIX rather than WORKSFORME?
