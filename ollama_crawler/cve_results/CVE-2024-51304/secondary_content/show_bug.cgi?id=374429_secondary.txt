virtualbox-bin, I assume is a binary version of virtual box, emerges fine.  On calling it, the gui fails to come up.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge package
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
call /opt/bin/VirtualBox

Failed to create the VirtualBox COM object

The application will now terminate.

Callee RC: 
NS_ERROR_FACTORY_NOT_REGISTERED (0x80040154)

(Is this a Windows system component?)

Expected Results:  
That it work

Does VirtualBox start when you invoke it from a console?

Oh wait, I think I've found the problem. Please logout from X and relogin. I bet that should fix the problem.
I suppose this happens when you had app-emulation/virtualbox installed before and then switch to virtualbox-bin. The virtualbox installation leaves some environment variables back that need to be reset to virtualbox-bin compliant values (which should happen on a logout/relogin into X).

I followed Ian's steps and got to the same error. Lars suggested a logout and a log back in again to fix the problem, he was correct. A simple logout and a login fixes the problem the virtualbox-bin GUI will run.

I have my user in the virtualbox group "vboxusers".

I gonna close this bug. It's simply a problem with the environment when you replace vbox-bin with vbox-nonbin or vice versa without a relogin.
