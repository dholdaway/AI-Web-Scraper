Trying to merge xfce4-mount 0.3.3 and ebuild digest fails

 emerge xfce4-mount
Calculating dependencies ...done!
>>> emerge (1 of 1) xfce-extra/xfce4-mount-0.3.3 to /
>>> md5 files   ;-) xfce4-mount-0.3.2.ebuild
>>> md5 files   ;-) xfce4-mount-0.3-r1.ebuild

!!! Digest verification Failed:
!!!    /usr/portage/xfce-extra/xfce4-mount/xfce4-mount-0.3.ebuild
!!! Reason: Filesize does not match recorded size

>>> Please ensure you have sync'd properly. Please try 'emerge sync' and
>>> optionally examine the file(s) for corruption. A sync will fix most cases.

Bug?

Thanks
Jim

Hm, this seems to be fixed already..? At least, it just worked for me:

>>> md5 files   ;-) xfce4-mount-0.3.ebuild
>>> md5 files   ;-) xfce4-mount-0.3-r1.ebuild
>>> md5 files   ;-) xfce4-mount-0.3.2.ebuild
>>> md5 files   ;-) xfce4-mount-0.3.3.ebuild
>>> md5 files   ;-) files/digest-xfce4-mount-0.3
>>> md5 files   ;-) files/digest-xfce4-mount-0.3-r1
>>> md5 files   ;-) files/digest-xfce4-mount-0.3.2
>>> md5 files   ;-) files/digest-xfce4-mount-0.3.3
>>> md5 src_uri ;-) xfce4-mount-plugin-0.3.tar.gz
>>> Unpacking source...

If I were a dev, I'd change the status to WORKSFORME or FIXED. Since I'm not, the XFCE team should consider to do so.

Emerge sync and try to emerge again, I'm sure it will work. Please report back if it did work..
