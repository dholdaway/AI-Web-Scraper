Description

Same problem as described here:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/evolution-exchange/+bug/213404
(copy of summary below):

I have Evolution set up with only one account, which is an MS Exchange account. When I create a new message, or begin to reply to a new message, the CPU usage goes up to about 60% for the system (all used by Evolution). The CPU will go down only by restarting Evolution.

There is gnome bug also: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=543022


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set up an Exchange email account
2. Leave the Global Catalog server blank
3. Try Use the email account for around ten minutes
Actual Results:  
high cpu usage (~60%)

Expected Results:  
normal cpu usage as with other evolution operations

It looks like this was fixed in new evolution version.

The launchpad bug mentions the bug going away with evolution-2.22.3.1 and the upstream bug doesn't seem to be updated. Are you still experiencing this problem ? If so we will need to teach you how to use a profiler to see where the cpu time is spent.

Currently using Evolution 2.24.5. No problems in this version so far.
