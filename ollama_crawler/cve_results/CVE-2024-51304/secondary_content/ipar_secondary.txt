Operational
Commentary
 
Jean
Madar, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer of Inter Parfums noted, “Ongoing demand for our brands, strong holiday season
sell-through, and a dynamic fragrance market resulted in a strong 2023 fourth quarter and record full year net sales and earnings
results.
 
“Of
special note, for the first time ever, each of our three largest brands generated sales in excess of $200 million. In 2023, Jimmy
Choo emerged as our largest brand, growing sales by 19%, and Montblanc and Coach sales rose by 15% and 25%, respectively.
 
“Our
fourth largest brand, GUESS, grew sales by a robust 23%. With a strategically planned pipeline of innovation, the brand is well
on its way to also exceed $200 million in sales in the coming years. Lastly, with growth of 21% for 2023, the fragrance sales
performance of Ferragamo has remained strong and continues to present significant growth opportunity.”
 
He
continued, “Especially gratifying, all of our markets experienced excellent growth last year. North America, Europe, and
Asia, our three largest markets, achieved sales gains of 22%, 21% and 17%, respectively. Our sales in the Middle East rose by
22% and Central and South America by 33%.
 
“Travel
retail and China sales did not have a meaningful effect on our sales, as they constitute a small portion of our business. We continue
to believe the Chinese market and travel retail offer great promise and stand ready to make strategic investments to grow our
business in China when the market opportunity aligns with market visibility.”
 


 
 

 
Mr.
Madar continued, “The new year is on track for continued growth as our aggressive advertising and promotion spend in the
fourth quarter drove sell-through for our retail partners, enabling 2024 first half restocking orders. Initial shipments of Lacoste
fragrances began in January, and Roberto Cavalli fragrances started shipping in February. Since signing both license agreements,
we have curated their collections and revitalized their best sellers. We are also developing impactful omnichannel advertising
and promotional campaigns to welcome back brand loyalists and attract influential fragrance enthusiasts to the newest members
of our fragrance portfolio.
 
“Following
initial success with Phase 1 of our Abercrombie & Fitch Fierce roll-out in certain major markets, including Europe,
Mexico, and Australia, in the final quarter of 2023, we have commenced with Phase 2 this year, further expanding into Western
Europe and Latin America, and may include other flankers of the Fierce family of products.
 
“We
recently introduced the highly concentrated, four scent luxury Cashmere Collection for Donna Karan and, across our brand
portfolio, we have a vibrant pipeline of new product launches in the works unveiling throughout 2024 including a new blockbuster
fragrance debuting for Lacoste,” Mr. Madar concluded.
 
Financial
Commentary 
Michel
Atwood, Chief Financial Officer of Inter Parfums pointed out, “We achieved our 2023 bottom line goal of $4.75 per diluted
share despite a $3.1 million tax assessment as the result of a tax audit undergone by our majority owned French subsidiary, Interparfums
SA, for the 2020 and 2021 tax years. Excluding this one-time impact, we would have delivered $4.82 per diluted share for the full
year, largely beating our guidance.”
 
Mr.
Atwood continued, “Consolidated gross margin as a percentage of net sales for 2023 and 2022 was nearly identical, with higher
selling prices and channel/product mix offsetting the inflation headwinds and segment mix.
 
“SG&A
as a percentage of net sales declined to 44.6% from 45.3% in 2022, largely driven by sales growth during 2023, which allowed for
better absorption of fixed operating costs and favorable segment mix. While we spent $107 million in the fourth quarter, a 23%
increase compared to same period in 2022, we finished the year below our advertising and promotion target of 21% of net sales,
coming in at 19.7% due in part to better than expected sales.
 
“These
factors led to $251 million in operating income, a 29% increase compared to 2022, and an operating profit margin of 19%, a 120
basis-point improvement from 2022,” Mr. Atwood pointed out.
 
“Finally,
our financial position remains strong. We closed the year with $183 million in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments,
and working capital of $514 million resulting in a working capital ratio of 2.6 to 1.”
 
Reaffirms
2024 Guidance 
Mr.
Atwood concluded, “We are a global Company operating in over 120 countries, and while the fragrance industry remains strong,
and retailers finished the year with healthy inventories, the political climate both in the Middle East and throughout Eastern
Europe leads us to keep our guidance unchanged due to lack of visibility. As the year unfolds and we attain greater clarity, we
will revisit our guidance. At this time, we are reaffirming our 2024 guidance, which calls for net sales of $1.45 billion, resulting
in earnings per diluted share of $5.15. This represents a 10% increase in net sales and an 8% increase in earnings per diluted
share.
 
“As
we previously reported and included in our guidance, the Lacoste non-cash amortization expense of the acquisition cost is expected
to reduce our 2024 earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.11.”
 
Guidance
assumes that the average dollar/euro exchange rate remains at current levels.
 

 
 

 
Announces
20% Increase in Cash Dividend 
Mr.
Atwood also announced, “Our Board of Directors approved a 20% increase in the annual dividend to $3.00 per share. The decisive
factors motivating our board's decision include our robust financial standing, promising growth opportunities, and commitment
to delivering value to our shareholders.”
 
The
next quarterly cash dividend of $0.75 per share is payable on March 29, 2024 to shareholders of record on March 15, 2024.
 
Share
Buyback Program  
In
December 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for our outstanding common stock. During 2023, the
Company repurchased 116,860 shares at a cost of $15.4 million. These shares are classified as treasury shares on the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet. In February 2024, our Board of Directors authorized the Company to continue repurchasing up to 130,000
shares throughout 2024.
