Description

All genntoo related pages have a link "http://www.gentoo.org/".
I would favor a link directly to the project, e.g.
"http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/portage/index.xml" for portage. If I want to see
the difference between two versions the ChangeLog in the portage tree only
mentions a bump. When I want to read more, I have to search for the project on
gentoo.org. If the link is more specific, it is much easier to find that
information (e.g. the ChangeLog link on the portage homepage)

Reproducible: Always

http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/index.xml?showlevel=1 is for Gentoo projects.

http://packages.gentoo.org/ is for packages in portage. 

I really don't understand how is portage changelog related to Gentoo projects page.

I believe what this bug is about is that for the portage ebuilds, the homepage
is set to http://www.gentoo.org/, when it could be set to
http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/portage/ instead. Similarly for other packages.
This would make it easier to find what changed between versions, assuming the
project page is kept up to date. Is this correct?

Yes, that is what I mean.
Portage and baselayout to name my favorites, but it may also apply to other
ebuilds.

I still don't understand. Packages in portage do not (for a vast majority) have
Gentoo project status, why should they be placed under Gentoo projects? Besides,
searching for any ebuild in http://packages.gentoo.org/ give me access to
changelogs and lot of other info in some 2 seconds.

Or are you talking about this?

portage-2.0.51.22-r2.ebuild

DESCRIPTION="The Portage Package Management System. The primary package
management and distribution system for Gentoo."
HOMEPAGE="http://www.gentoo.org/" <---!
