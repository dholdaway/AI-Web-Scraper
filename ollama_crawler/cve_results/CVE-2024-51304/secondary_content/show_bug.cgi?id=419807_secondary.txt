=====

This goes away if I install and eselect python-2.7.  I expect either the dep needs to be made more specific + python_set_active_version 2 be called, or gen.py needs to be patched to work with python-3.

Note, if gen.py uses the python module from graphviz, this package will definitely need to "python_set_active_version 2" as graphviz does not install modules to python-3 either.

can't reproduce with media-gfx/exiv2-0.23. Please test and reopen if this problem still exists.
