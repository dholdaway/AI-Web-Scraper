Description

I recently upgraded to Plasma 5 following the guide under https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/KDE/Plasma_5_upgrade.

Amongst many things which don't work anymore now, this one is particularly annoying: None of the KWin global hotkeys work. Most prominently, that's Alt+Tab, but also custom keys I set for switching between desktops don't work. How can I debug this?

When I open konsole and type several hotkeys in there, things get really strange. When I type Super_L + t on an empty prompt, it prints out "localhost", and types the characters "st" into the prompt. 
When I type Ctrl + Alt + Up, it types "A" into the prompt.

This also happens if I create a new user and try it there.

Unique to the user I had before I installed Plasma is the following:
When I type Alt + F2 in a konsole, it types "Q" into the prompt.

I have the german Neo layout activated, but the bug persists when I switch to a US layout. (I have changed the keymap to neo under /etc/conf.d/keymaps as well, though.)

I have deleted ~/.config/khotkeysrc and ~/.config/kglobalshortcutsrc and rebooted several times.

When I start xev and run the hotkeys in there, all keys get registered the correct way.

About the Super_L + t bug: The bug appears for any alphanumeric character except the keys that correspond to q, e, s, d and f in a US layout. In the Neo layout, these are the keys that correspond to PageUp, Up, Left, Down and Right on the 4th level.

About the Alt + F2 - bug: When I had freshly installed Plasma 5, Alt + F2 worked, also in my main user which I had before. Now it only works in the new test user I recently created, and deleting ~/.config/khotkeysrc and ~/.config/kglobalshortcutsrc and rebooting doesn't bring it back.

Changing the layout in /etc/conf.d/keymaps to "us" doesn't help.

Can not reproduce here. If you have further problems with the global shortcuts, please report it to upstream.
