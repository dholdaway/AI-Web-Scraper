Description

          2007-03-19 23:42:55 UTC
        

Everytime when I try to load the kernel on my Octane R12K I get this...

prom write error on cacheline 0x1fcc0f00 at PC=8000000202729e0 

But using bootp works fine.

Reproducible: Always

Can you provide your kernel/mips-sources version and arcload version?  This info is somewhat useful, yanno...

Oh, and additionally, the Prom version would also help.  You can get this by typing "version" at the Prom command line.  It's possibly an old Prom revision that may be the cause of this.

Are PROM updates available ??

prom updates are available as part of the IRIX install process, I believe. (Sorry it's taken so long for someone to answer your question)

Since this bug is rather old, we have one user who reported it working with a newer prom version, and Octane support is dead in the Linux kernel, I'm going to close this bug as WONTFIX.

I am going to re-open and take this one myself, now that I have Octane booting Linux again.  Putting arcload on my TODO to test again at some point, though it'll primarily be with an R14000 module instead of an R12000.

Apologies on taking so long to resolve this, but a test on an Octane w/ R12000 CPU indicates that arcload 0.5 does work after some fiddling:

Resolving as WORKSFORME.  Please open a new bug if this issue is seen again (but do update the PROM first, as it is possibly related to an old PROM).
