I'm trying to run a regular "emerge -avDuN world" with media-libs/jasper being updated, and it breaks on a version mismatch on libtool.  I'm attaching my build log and others to show the error.

Reproducible: Always

On the new 1.900.3 release I don't have this problem. Feel free to reopen if problem persists.
