Description

Section 3 talks all about eth0 in the configuration of the ethernet,
which is fine and matches the minimal iso install disc. But we are 
now installing UDEV 2.x, which reassigns the the eth0 name to something
like enp5s0. So after reboot the ethernet does not work and much be reconfigured
manually to get the sytem up. So a section on setting up the udev named
eithernet (dmesg discovery or ifconfig) including the rc default portion
is needed.  It would be best to patch the minimal iso install to use
the current udev name for the interface and not assume it's going to
be eth0. Or show folks in the install documentation how to set/change the
ethernet interface name to eth0, dispite newer version of UDEV.

If you're using a recent gentoo minimal install cd, it already has the new udev with new naming.  It has been this way for a while.  How old is your install cd where you still see eth0?

The installation CD is OK, including the new udev naming scheme. I'm talking about the handbook, needs to use the udev assigned name to the ethernet interface, not eth0. Were talking about Section 3 of the handbook.

From Section 3:

"The interface name on your system can be quite different from eth0. Recent installation media might show regular network interfaces names like eno0, ens1 or enp5s0. Just seek the interface in the ifconfig output that has an IP address related to your local network."

OK. Now put those sorts of comments into the handbook. I see not discussion
on the ethernet naming scheme, either udev defined or the traditional
eth0 and how udev WILL change that name, eventually. We're talking about
what is in the Handbook. I have no installation issues.

Not to mention how to override udev if one has preferential names
or multiple ethernet interfaces, with udev/systemd in the mix.

It's just a suggestion to make the handbook better, act on it
or close the bug. I'm done.

My above quote was from the current english amd64 handbook, maybe you are looking at a different one that hasn't been updated?  I'm not trying to attack you here, I'm not clear as to where there is an actual problem.

ben is correct; the handbooks all have this text already.
