Description

Konsole by default uses the Monospace font, but it is already somewhat difficult to read on standard characters. More important, coloured text partly is not displayed at all. I had to change to another font, e.g. Lucida Typewriter. Every other font I've tried works well, so far.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.install kde-4.1.2
2.open Applications/System/Terminal
3.run an application in that terminal window that produces coloured text, like equery

I can't confirm that. I am using Monospace size 9 with smooth fonts enabled in kde-base/konsole-4.1.2 without any problems.

That's odd; after some experimentation I found out it's just a coincidence. Try any font size but 9 and 13 and you'll notice the problem.

That is your settings problem
Basicaly kde hinting system hints only fonts which are not in range from 9 to 13.

So change your settings in systemsettings and try again.
Close if fixed or report how it broke then :]

Excuse me? I have installed kde using all the defaults and you say it's my fault? That's turning the world upside down, in my opinion. Although I did find the solution myself I still maintain its's a bug.

If KDE wants me to change Monospace 10 to Monospace 9 sytem-wide it should change its default. It's as simple as that.

Nope it is hinting issue. And you have to enable it yourself.
But by default there is exception range between 8-15 pt.
So actualy it is not kde falut directly.
Here is screenshot of what i mean:

Sorry for the czech locale but i didnt figure how to launch thaat systemsettings in en.

Btw i really hope that that is the issue because that monospace works here with this settings.

I'm sorry but you seem to miss my point. I don't really know what you mean by hinting issue or system, but it is not relevant for this bug. I'll try to explain once more.

The problem really is that the monospace font is unusable inside konsole. Whether it's not implemented well or konsole has a bug, that's not for me to decide.

You can of course hide this bug by changing the system setting. That way it does not bother you anymore. Or, KDE can decide to change its default fixed-width font to Monospace 9 or Lucida or something else. That way more people will not see this bug. But still the bug hasn't been solved, because if someone chooses to change the system fixed-width font to Monospace 8, 10, 11, 12 or 14, the bug will appear.

I hope I made myself clear.

Oh by the way, this problem does not occur in gnome (version 2.22.3). I can perfectly read Monospace 10 in "Terminal" there. More evidence, if necessary.

Nope, I don't. Works fine for other sizes as well.

It does not seem to be a general bug, because no one else reported it (here) and it works at least for me.

> You can of course hide this bug by changing the system setting.

I did not change the default settings for fonts there. But as Tomáš suggested: you should try to configure "System Settings->Appearance->Fonts->Use anti-aliasing" to see whether the problem vanishes.

I am sorry but i have to close this as worksforme because i tested it on fresh confs on 3 machines and nowhere was the issue.

I am still convinced that it is config issue. If you want to discus it in more realtime join #gentoo-kde and poke me about the problem and we can think up some solution hopefuly.

Boy are you guys hard to convince... Do you think I make this up or do this for fun? the font aliasing didn't help either.

so for the moment I will not re-open this bug but I'm not satisfied either. So pleas tell me which configs you need to check and I'll send them.

Ok this is indeed nothing in common with pixel hinting. But still i cannot reproduce it so i am out of ideas. but reopening :]

Ok i did a bit of research and it seems like some weird bug on nvidia/intel drivers, on ati it is unreproduceable. And i get confirmation with nvidia mostly.
So try to play with your drivers, if some of them works please close this because we are unable to do anything with binary blob from them.

Hm. I'm not fond of this. But, I tried...

Alas, I was unable to downgrade my nvidia-drivers. I have installed x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers-177.80. I tried to downgrade (by using /etc/portage/package.mask) first to 173.14.12, then to 173.14.09, then to 173.14.05 and finally to 169.12.

All 4 versions failed to build!

I give up...

I am sorry for not too much active bug here, here is what i found out.
In 1.80X.X drivers from nvidia was fixed load of rendering bugs with kde4.
In qt4 seems to be weird rendering with some fonts, currently in progress. Take look on bug 252312.

I now have x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers-177.82 and the bug has gone away. I'm not 100% sure it's the driver, but it works for me. I'll close the bug.
