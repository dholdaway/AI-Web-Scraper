ABB Cylon Aspect 3.08.01 persistenceManagerAjax.php Directory Traversal
Posted Oct 10, 2024
Authored by LiquidWorm | Site zeroscience.mk
ABB Cylon Aspect version 3.08.01 has a directory traversal vulnerability that can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker to list the contents of arbitrary directories without reading file contents, leading to information disclosure of directory structures and filenames. This may expose sensitive system details, aiding in further attacks. The issue lies in the listFiles() function of the persistenceManagerAjax.php script, which calls PHP's readdir() function without proper input validation of the directory POST parameter.

ABB Cylon Aspect 3.08.01 Remote Code Execution
Posted Sep 24, 2024
Authored by LiquidWorm | Site zeroscience.mk
ABB Cylon Aspect version 3.08.01 BMS/BAS controller suffers from a remote code execution vulnerability. The vulnerable uploadFile() function in bigUpload.php improperly reads raw POST data using the php://input wrapper without sufficient validation. This data is passed to the fwrite() function, allowing arbitrary file writes. Combined with an improper sanitization of file paths, this leads to directory traversal, allowing an attacker to upload malicious files to arbitrary locations. Once a malicious file is written to an executable directory, an authenticated attacker can trigger the file to execute code and gain unauthorized access to the building controller.
