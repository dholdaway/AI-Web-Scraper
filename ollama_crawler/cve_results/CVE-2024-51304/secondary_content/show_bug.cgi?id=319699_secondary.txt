The x11-themes/xcursor-themes handhelds, redglass and whiteglass are missing
some symlinks.

Result: Certain applications and/or window actions do not show the correct cursors, and default back the the monochrome Xorg cursors.

There is already a bug report about this, but that somehow got marked as 'resolved', whereas the issue is clearly not resolved.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge x11-themes/xcursor-themes
2. cd /usr/share/cursors/xorg-x11
3. ls gentoo/cursors/
4. Notice symlinks.
5. ls whiteglass/cursors/
6. Notice *lack of* symlinks


Actual Results:  
Missing symlinks can be observed for 3 out of six contained cursor themes.

Expected Results:  
All cursor themes should be complete, having all necessary symlinks.

http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=136769 <-- This bug is reporting the same issue, but is marked as RESOLVED(NEEDINFO), however I don't see why  it was marked as such. This issue is not resolved, and all info seems to be present in that bug. If any info is missing please clarify exactly what information is missing so that it may be provided.

I am unable confirm that this is still a thing. I've checked x11-themes/xcursor-themes-1.0.6 and the themes installed by xcursor-theme indeed have symlinks.
