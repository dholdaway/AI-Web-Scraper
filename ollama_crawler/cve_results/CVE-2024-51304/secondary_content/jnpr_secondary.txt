 Inside Juniper Networks Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
The below accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.



 Other - Other   Highlight
As a result, our inventory levels increased in 2023 and are expected to remain elevated in the near term.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
In prior periods, global supply chain constraints and component parts shortages resulted in extended lead times of certain products to our customers and impacted the volume of products we were able to deliver, which negatively impacted our ability to recognize revenue.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Service net revenues increased primarily driven by strong sales of hardware maintenance contracts and SaaS subscriptions.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
In 2023, the new regulations resulted in incremental cash tax payments of approximately $150 million and a reduction in our effective tax rate due to increased benefit from U.S. foreign-derived intangible income and an increased federal R&D credit.
