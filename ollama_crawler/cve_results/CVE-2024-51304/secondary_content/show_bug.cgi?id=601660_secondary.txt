Please make it possible to install Chef via Portage.

I am willing to pay $50. Criteria is ebuild getting into mainline portage tree.

I see that it was removed from tree previously due to lack of maintainer: http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/gentoo/dev/298437

Hey Andrey,
I am using chef for a customer setup, and it would be nice to have it back in the main tree, as I am already devoting my spare time to finish phpunit packaging,
I have not much free time actually but maybe later, and your offer is nice, maybe you can donate it to gentoo project[1] if the ebuild hit the tree.

BTW there is a not so old version, accessible by layman overlay maybe you can try to install it, check if it still work[2].

Hi Guillaume,

I have set up chef and other necessary Ruby stuff locally to ~/.gem with "gem" command, so chef in portage tree is not so critical for me now.

I have donated $100 to Gentoo Foundation a year ago, I should consider doing this again :)
