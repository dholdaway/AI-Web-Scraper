When I click on the homepage link in the packages.gentoo.org page for audtty it tooks me to any other page. Seems like the specified url doesn't exists. 
Here is where the link take me

This works for me. I am taken to the correct homepage on http://packages.gentoo.org/search/?sstring=audtty. 

Rodrigo, can you check and close the bug if it is fixed for you now as well? Thanks.

As far as bugs are concerned (AFABAC?) this has got to be the coolest bug number (#123321) :-) However...

Yeah, if this ever was a bug it probably got fixed long ago... Either that or somone did not wait long enough (12 hours) for packages.gentoo.org to update HOMEPAGEs for ebuilds.
