I tested this on two different machines (two different internet connections) with no problems downloading the file:

shanghai:~ # emerge -f =virtualbox-additions-4.0.4
Calculating dependencies... done!

It seems to be connected with network configuration of our institut, if I try the download from a box in the university I get the file without problems in few seconds.

But it is a really strange error for me. Some part of the file ca. 5-11 Mbyte is downloaded and then the transfer stops. Sometimes I get messages as:

Read error at byte 11513208/38408192 (Connection timed out)

sometime the transfer simply hangs without any error messages.

Nobody else reported anything like that so I cannot be of much help here.
