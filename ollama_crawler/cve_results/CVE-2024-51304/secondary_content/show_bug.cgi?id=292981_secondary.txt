Infra runs the up2date-ng script that creates $URI per cron.

The script uses two "config" files, up2date_package.altname and up2date_package.mask.

Once I asked Robin to sync the files from the "upstream" repo to the infra box.
I think this is boring for both, the perl team as well as the infra team.
I also think that the "upstream" repo is not the right place for these "downstream" changes.

Can we make the files available somewhere else and sync them automatically? Like adding them to gentoo/xml/htdocs/proj/en/perl/up2date-ng/...? (Probably needs renameing to *.txt?)

Err, my wrapper already updates the config files and up2date-ng from the SVN repo automatically, as you when asked before for me to do it manually, and I didn't want to keep doing it by hand, so I just automated it into the rest of the calls.

If you want to move them, sure, but I don't think that is needed, and they actually should rather stay with the script, as they have evolved alongside it.

I didn't know that. You should have told me ,)

If it already works, there is no need to change it.

Thanks and closing.
