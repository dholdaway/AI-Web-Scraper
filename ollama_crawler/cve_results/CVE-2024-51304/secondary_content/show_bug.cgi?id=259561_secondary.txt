I try to RE-emerge phpMyAdmin because i didn't find eny phpmyadmin-files at my web-server's root after having installed dev-lang/php-5.2.8-r2.

entry in /etc/portage/package.use:
dev-php/php crypt ctype pcre session unicode mysql
#dev-php/php-5 crypt ctype pcre session unicode mysql

should i download phpmyadmin-files manualy  since apache, mysql and php are running? 

emerge phpmyadmin
...
...
dev-lang/php-5.2.8-r2 needs to be re-installed with all of the following
 * USE flags enabled:
 *
 * crypt ctype pcre session unicode
 *
 * as well as any of the following USE flags enabled:
 *
 * mysql or mysqli if using dev-lang/php-5

dev-php/php and dev-php/php-5 no more exist, remove them, and use dev-lang/php instead. Add to dev-lang/php in your package.use USE-flag mysql, and remerge php and phpadmin.
