     FOR IMMEDIATE ISSUESTAGWELL INC. (NASDAQ: STGW) REPORTS RESULTS FOR THE THREE AND TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023 Expects 2024 Organic Net Revenue Growth of 5% to 7%; Adjusted EBITDA of $400 million to $450 million; Free Cash Flow Conversion of ~50%Net Revenue Growth of 31% from Stagwell Marketing Cloud Group in FY23Growth of 13% in International Net Revenue in FY23, Led by 17% Growth in EMEA$65 million of net new business in Q4; LTM net new business exceeds $270 millionFY Revenue of $2,527 million; FY Net revenue of $2,147 millionFY Net Income of $42 million; FY Adjusted EBITDA of $360 millionNew York, NY, February 27, 2024 (NASDAQ: STGW) – Stagwell Inc. (“Stagwell”) today announced financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023.Mark Penn, Chairman and CEO, said, “Despite a challenging year for marketing services and digital transformation—accentuated by our client mix—Stagwell grew share with some of our largest customers in 2023, took prudent steps to manage our costs, and invested in digital innovation to stay ahead of the future of marketing. In Q4 we returned to sequential net revenue growth, sold a non-core asset for significantly above our initial investment, and saw our tech company clients begin to re-engage.” “2024 promises to be a year of growth and expanded margin as we go into the political season and our AI and AR products come to market – including inclusion of ARound into Major League Baseball’s native Ballpark app. We will be helping our clients transform with the three E’s of AI – enabling stronger operations, adding efficiency to marketing and helping revolutionize their engagement with consumers.” Frank Lanuto, Chief Financial Officer, commented: “Management faced ongoing macroeconomic headwinds during the fourth quarter and responded with decisive actions to align costs with revenues, resulting in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 17 percent. Through the end of fiscal 2023, we have delivered – ahead of schedule – the $30 million in synergies that we promised at the time of our merger in 2021 and are now well underway with our goal of achieving the incremental $35 million of cost savings we announced earlier this year. Our sale of ConcentricLife during the quarter resulted in a significant gain which drove net income, reduced our debt and lowered leverage at year end."  Financial Outlook2024 financial guidance is as follows:•Organic Net Revenue growth of 5% to 7%•Organic Net Revenue excluding Advocacy growth of 4% to 5%•Adjusted EBITDA of $400 million to $450 million•Free Cash Flow Conversion of approximately 50%•Adjusted EPS of $0.75 - $0.88Page 1The following information was filed by Stagwell Inc (STGW) on Tuesday, February 27, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.
