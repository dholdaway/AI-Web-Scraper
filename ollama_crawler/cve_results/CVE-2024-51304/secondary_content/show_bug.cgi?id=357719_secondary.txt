Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Open http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=343421 (or any other bug report) in your browser.
Actual Results:  
Text background is gray.

Expected Results:  
Text background is white.

Under preferences you can select the classic skin, this makes it uses white as background again

Re comment #2:

Noted. But we are talking about the page display that any user gets by default (including me as I am not normally logged in).

The default display should be "easy to read", with "hard to read" a user selectable option.

The new "skin" is quite nice but please make the background of comments (at least) white again.

BTW: The bug summary really gets lost in all the noise, you actively have to search for it. But I can live with that.

This theme exists for years, and you are the first one to complain that the light grey background is a problem. ;) So this problem definitely doesn't affect many users.

Well, we are at least 2 users to complain now !

The classic skin is great. I use Firefox + Stylish extension to solve such problems I often encountered (many sites have an ugly gray background but I prefer either black or white unmixed)...

Is there some link to the "classic.css" stylesheet I could use ? I had a (quick) look in the source and found no evident link...

PS: my two cents about colors : since the main color is purple, a light (very light) yellow would better fit than this grey.

Hans already explained in comment 1 how to select the skin (theme) you want. This preference exists in all Bugzilla installations.

Try /skins/standard/global.css

Re comment #3:

I can assure you that until yesterday bug reports were plain black on white. It is definitely a regression. So do not be surprised when more people are going to complain.

Re comment #5:

As explained in comment #2 you can only use another skin if you are logged in which cannot not be assumed.

Please keep the discussion on topic which is about the DEFAULT bug display.

Yes, but (as S.F. said) the problem remains when you are not logged in, and for non-registered users.

Thank you.
Here is what I've made :
http://pastebin.com/DvSXsCUW
I'm afraid you'll need the extension I told about before to try this out. There's a white background for comment blocks, and lightyellow for the header block and the main part of the pages. Much more readable.

I don't know exactly how to translate that back to a usable CSS file.

What about setting the "classic" theme as the default theme ?

The majority of comments regarding the new look and feel were positive, so I do not consider this to be a regression nor a problem.

As stated, the colors are default in many Bugzillas all over the web for years now.

Users that have a problem with the colors can use either
a) use the 'Standard' theme with reduced color usage
b) implement a user CSS changing the parts that they do not like (for instance using the Stylish extension for Firefox or Chrome)

As for default and thus more 'casual' users of our Bugzilla, we believe the default theme is a good choice (as well as for advanced users of course, but I think these have an account anyway to use the theme preferences).

Thanks.
