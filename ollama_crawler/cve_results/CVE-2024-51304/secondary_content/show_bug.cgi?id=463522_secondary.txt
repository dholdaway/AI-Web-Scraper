one of those erased my plasma settings back to default:

rh1 ~ # egrep ':::.*kde-base' /var/log/emerge.log |tail -4
1364345490:  ::: completed emerge (2 of 22) kde-base/ksmserver-4.10.1-r1 to /
1364346328:  ::: completed emerge (7 of 22) kde-base/drkonqi-4.10.1-r1 to /
1364348362:  ::: completed emerge (2 of 9) kde-base/systemsettings-4.10.1-r1 to /
1364348873:  ::: completed emerge (3 of 5) kde-base/plasma-workspace-4.10.1-r1 to /
r

All of those where at version 4.10.1, last time my settings where untouched.

What do you mean with "erase plasma's customization" ?

If it is about the plasma-based screen locker, that has been disabled deliberately since it is a security risk (see bug 462152). 

Other functionality should not be affected.

These settings were lost the first time I logged in after the updates:

1) A second screen on DISPLAY 0.1 together with all the plasmoids I've put there
2) The opened application windows in the user session on the main screen

Only the plasmoids placed on the main screen survived.

(I know nothing about that screen locker bug, because I have actually a screen locker bug of my own, that is that the password field to unlock never gets the keyboard focus)

Strange: With the second login into this user the DISPLAY 0.1 reappeared. No idea how, but perhaps this is thus of less importance than normal.

OK...

I have no idea how this could be caused by the upgrades. The patches in the four packages are pretty minimal:

* ksmserver: ignore the configuration file setting about plasma screenlocker (5 code lines changed)
* systemsettings: disable radio button about plasma screenlocker (3 code lines changed)
* plasma-workspace: do not build plasma screenlocker (3 code lines changed)
* drkonqui (cannot be related in any way): fix a hang bug when adding a backtrace to an existing bug report

Let's keep the bug open for a few days to see if any duplicates occur, but I dont think this should block stabilization.

No further reports on this, closing WORKSFORME.
