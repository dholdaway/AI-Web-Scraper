Description

          2011-11-19 11:37:07 UTC
        

After upgrade (emerge -DuN world) flash players (like youtube) stopped working in every www client (opera, google-chrome, firefox-7). revdep-rebuild -i shows that the system is consistent and re-emerging www-plugins/adobe-flash is not resolving the problem.

Thanks for any hints how to proceed.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
Open youtube and the films are not played (I see gray screen where the film should be played).

Simply, a reboot helped to get flash players to work.
