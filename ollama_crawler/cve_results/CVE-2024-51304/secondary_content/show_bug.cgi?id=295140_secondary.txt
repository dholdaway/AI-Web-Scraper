Apparently rebuilding soprano fixes it.

Rebuilding soprano fixed this issue to me too.

Yes, rebuilding dev-libs/soprano fixes the issue.

Personaly rebuilding soprano made it works.

However I compiled
dev-libs/soprano-2.3.1-r1 (current soprano stable ebuild)

in order to update my old
dev-libs/soprano-2.3.1 ebuild (previous soprano stable ebuild)

I don't know whether it is the same fact on your computers.

There is no difference between 2.3.1 and 2.3.1-r1 at all, I've bumped it to -r1 exactly for this, to make people recompile it for no-obvious-reason since nobody ever was able to tell what changed, except that "it just works"
