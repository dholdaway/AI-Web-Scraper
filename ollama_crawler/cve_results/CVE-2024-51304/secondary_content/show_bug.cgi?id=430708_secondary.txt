Here is the beginning of the error from when i tried to emerge this package.

It looks like CPAN::Meta and Parse::CPAN::Meta is required.

It turns out that I have virtual/perl-CPAN-Meta version 2.112.621 and virtual/perl-Parse-CPAN-Meta version 1.440.100-r2 installed. (The corresponding packages from perl-core are there too.) It seems like that the versions should be sufficient.

I'll attach a build log.

never mind about this "bug". the problem was fixed by:

perl-cleaner --all
