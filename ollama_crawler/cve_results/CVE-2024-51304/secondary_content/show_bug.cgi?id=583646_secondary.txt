Description

My laptop is ASUS K501LX. When I followed the instructions to install grub in EFI mode, grub-install told me "EFI variables are not supported on this system". First time EFI user, I didn't know it meant that it failed to install EFI. As a result, the system completely failed to boot. I had to create a new EFI entry manually pointing to grub.

Maybe the user guide should warn something about this. It was a couple of frustrating hours. Of course the better solution is update install .iso image to never been in this situation (grub-install was running fine for me after installation), but that would be much harder I guess.

Reproducible: Always

the wiki has a pretty robust section on getting the bootloader working on EFI systems. please read the relevant chapter in the wiki-fied version of the handbook:

https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Bootloader

if there are any other suggestions, please use that page's "Discussion" tab. closing this old bug.
