Hi,
i just recognized that after emerge -NDu world installed a new baselayout (2.0). 
Some things were not working anymore:
1.) There's no net.eth0 symlink, instead a non-working net.eth1 (I have no eth1)
2.) net.lo doesn't start up at booting, so especiallay there's no route to 127.0.0.1. Cups stopped working because of that.



Reproducible: Always

http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/openrc-migration.xml

as issue you are speaking of are in the doc, you better read it first, then re-think if it's still a bug

I think #2 may be a valid problem. I am currently setup exactly as the doc says and it didn't start net.lo. This caused problems with other things, such as netmount starting before net.lo and net.eth0 and cupsd not working at all.

I want to recall that previous comment of mine. It would seem after several reboots, with no real changes made, it has started behaving correctly. The only thing that might have caused it to work was disabling and re-enabling the net* services to their previous settings. This worked after I first changed to the new openrc setup, then stopped, then is back to working again.
