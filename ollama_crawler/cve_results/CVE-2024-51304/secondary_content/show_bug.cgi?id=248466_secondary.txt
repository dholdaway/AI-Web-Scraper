I am unable to emerge lzma-utils. Emerges dies at the end of the unpack stage.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge -1 lzma-utils

Actual Results:  
 * lzma-4.32.7.tar.gz RMD160 SHA1 SHA256 size ;-) ...                     [ ok ]
 * checking ebuild checksums ;-) ...                                      [ ok ]
 * checking auxfile checksums ;-) ...                                     [ ok ]
 * checking miscfile checksums ;-) ...                                    [ ok ]
 * checking lzma-4.32.7.tar.gz ;-) ...                                    [ ok ]
>>> Unpacking source...
>>> Unpacking lzma-4.32.7.tar.gz to /var/tmp/portage/app-arch/lzma-utils-4.32.7/work
>>> Source unpacked.
 * The ebuild phase 'unpack' has exited unexpectedly. This type of behavior
 * is known to be triggered by things such as failed variable assignments
 * (bug #190128) or bad substitution errors (bug #200313).

Expected Results:  
lzma-utils installed on system

emerge -1 bash before emerge -1 lama-utils did the trick. Thank you.
