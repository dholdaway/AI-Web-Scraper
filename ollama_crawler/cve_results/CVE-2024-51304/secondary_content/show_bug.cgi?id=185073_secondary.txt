app-text/poppler-data digest fails.  The digest for poppler-data needs to be regenerated.

!!! Digest verification failed:
!!! /usr/portage/app-text/poppler-data/poppler-data-0.1.ebuild
!!! Reason: Filesize does not match recorded size
!!! Got: 675
!!! Expected: 657
- app-text/poppler-data-0.1 (masked by: corruption)


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
emerge app-text/poppler-data
Actual Results:  
Fails to emerge due to digest corruption.

Expected Results:  
emerge the package.

I take that back.  The digest file is missing entirely.
