full year and fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Results
Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc. Reports Full Year and Fourth Quarter Earnings Results; Declares a First Quarter Base Dividend Per Share of $0.46, and a Fourth Quarter Supplemental Dividend Per Share of $0.08.
 








NEW YORK—February 15, 2024— Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc. (NYSE: TSLX, or the “Company”) today reported net investment income of $2.31 per share and net income of $2.61 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2023. For the quarter ended December 31, 2023 net investment income and net income per share were $0.62 and $0.58, respectively. The Company’s net investment income in the fourth quarter was largely driven by a robust level of interest income from the strength of the core earnings power of the portfolio. Return on equity (ROE) for the full year 2023 was 14.1% and 15.9% on a net investment income and a net income basis, respectively. Annualized ROE for the fourth quarter 2023 was 14.7% and 13.8% on a net investment income and a net income basis, respectively.Both net investment income per share and net income per share for the year include approximately $0.05 per share of capital gains incentive fee expenses that were accrued, but not paid or payable, related to cumulative unrealized capital gains in excess of cumulative net realized capital gains less any cumulative unrealized losses and capital gains incentive fees paid inception-to-date. Excluding the impact of the accrued capital gains incentive fee expenses, the Company’s adjusted net investment income and adjusted net income for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $2.36 per share and $2.66 per share, respectively. For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, adjusted net investment income per share was $0.62 and adjusted net income per share was $0.58. Return on equity (ROE) for the full year 2023 was 14.4% and 16.2% on an adjusted net investment income and an adjusted net income basis, respectively. Annualized ROE for the fourth quarter 2023 was 14.5% and 13.6% on an adjusted net investment income and an adjusted net income basis, respectively. Reported net asset value (NAV) per share was $17.04 at December 31, 2023 as compared to $16.97 at September 30, 2023. The Company announced that its Board of Directors has declared a first quarter 2024 base dividend of $0.46 per share to shareholders of record as of March 15, 2024 and payable on March 28, 2024. The Board also announced a fourth quarter supplemental dividend of $0.08 per share to shareholders of record as of February 29, 2024, payable on March 20, 2024. Adjusted for the impact of the supplemental dividend related to this quarter’s earnings, the Company’s Q4 adjusted NAV per share was $16.96. The primary drivers of this year’s NAV per share growth were the over-earning of our base dividend through net investment income, accretive capital markets transactions, and realized and unrealized gains on investments.Post-quarter end, the Company issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that mature on March 1, 2029 (the "2029 Notes"). The 2029 Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.125% per year. The Company used the net proceeds of the 2029 Notes to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility. In connection with the offering, the Company entered into an interest rate swap to better align the interest rate of its liabilities with the Company's investment portfolio, which consists of predominately floating rate loans. As a result of the swap, the Company's effective interest rate on the 2029 Notes is SOFR plus 243 basis points.
