Could you list all docbook, xml, xsl and sgml related packages you have installed? I don't have app-text/docbook-sgml-dtd:4.5 and it is not really required.

/usr/share/sgml/docbook/xml-dtd-4.4/ent/isogrk4.ent is from package app-text/docbook-xml-dtd:4.5 and it is a symlink to /usr/share/sgml/xml-iso-entities-8879.1986/ISOgrk4.ent from package app-text/sgml-common.

Before 'emerge dracut' no such packages are installed, for reproducing this bug just do 'emerge --depclean --with-bdeps=n; emerge -v dracut'

I've been installing dracut on fresh systems and this problem never occurred to me. Required packages holding these files are app-text/sgml-common and app-text/docbook-xml-dtd:4.5 which are pulled for dracut. Therefore I'm closing it as invalid. Maybe try to reemerge these packages?
