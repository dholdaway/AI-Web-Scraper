canidates are dev-util/yacc and sys-apps/bison (and dev-util/byacc?)

Don't see why if they all work with bison.  Just install bison with the /usr/bin/yacc symlink
and rip yacc.  If byacc is not used by anything specifically (meaning they cannot build with bison),
then rip that as well.  My opinion anyhow - why complicate things if not needed?

agreed

our bison already drops a /usr/bin/yacc symlink if no other yacc's have been installed
