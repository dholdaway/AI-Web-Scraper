Description


Diego Elio Pettenò (RETIRED)

You're receiving this bug because the package in Summary has produced _FORTIFY_SOURCE related warnings indicating the presence of a sure overflow in a static buffer.

Even though this is not always an indication of a security problem it might even be. So please check this out ASAP.

By the way, _FORTIFY_SOURCE is disabled when you disable optimisation, so don't try finding out the cause using -O0.

Thanks,
Your friendly neighborhood tinderboxer

I'm not able to reproduce this issue 

Portage 2.2_rc88 (default/linux/x86/10.0/desktop/kde, gcc-4.4.4, glibc-2.11.2-r0, 2.6.35-gentoo i686)

Portage 2.2_rc88 (default/linux/amd64/10.0/desktop/kde, gcc-4.4.4, glibc-2.12.1-r1, 2.6.35-gentoo-r8 x86_64)

(for other packages QA reported)

I don't see such errors too.
