While upgrading xen-tools-4.0.0 to xen-tools-4.0.1 I got the following warning message:

* Deprecation Warning: Not passing of paths to python_mod_cleanup() is deprecated and will be
 * disallowed on 2010-09-01. Call python_mod_cleanup() with paths to Python modules.
 * The ebuild needs to be fixed. Please report a bug, if it has not been already reported.

Best regards

It was fixed long time ago.
