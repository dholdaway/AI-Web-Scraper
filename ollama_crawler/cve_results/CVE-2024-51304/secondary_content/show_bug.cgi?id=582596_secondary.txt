Description

Old legacy KDE 4 applications, such as media-video/kplayer-0.7.2-r1:4 do not start, because the socket kdeinit4__0 is missing.

The error message is:

KCrash: Connect sock_file=/home/USER_NAME/.kde4/socket-HOSTNAME/kdeinit4__0
KCrash: connect() failed: : File or directory missing 

The folder /home/USER_NAME/.kde4/ exists but contains two broken symlinks because their destination is missing:

socket-HOSTNAME --> /run/user/1000/ksocket-USER_NAME
tmp-HOSTNAME --> /tmp/kde-USER_NAME

It seems that this problem only occurs on boxes that got a fresh KDE 5 installation (no upgrade). On boxes that had a previous KDE 4 installation and were upgraded the sockets exists indeed. However, all necessary KDE 4 dependencies are emerged on both kind of boxes.

There is no KDE 5, i think you mean Plasma 5?

Is kde-apps/kdebase-runtime-meta or kde-base/kdebase-startkde installed?

Please check read/write permissions for the needed destinations.
