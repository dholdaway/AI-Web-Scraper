Hello, I get "undefined symbol: initPAnsiStrings" if I don't copy all of the library files from "/opt/teamspeak2-client/" to "/usr/lib32"

When I copy them, it runs fine!

Thanks.

Same problem seen here. Fix also works. We could also probably add a TeamSpeak script to the ebuild to set LD path to include /usr/teamspeak2-bin/ and start the bin.

Sorry, I just took over the teamspeak-client package.

How are you starting teamspeak when you get this error?
