Description

hello,
i have a little problem on the new installed system (last week) and installing updates today.

for this update, a perl-version-update is installed and there is a problem with the order of the updates.

sample:
i use -j to compile more then one package at the same time.
before all perl-packages are updated, the update for sys-devel/gdb is started, but this program need texinfo for compiling and texinfo don't work, while this is a perl-program and perl update is not completed at this time so that some needed perl modules don't work.
to update gdb, all perl-updates and perl-programs must be updated or gdb can't be updated.

i think that this problem is not only with gdb, but i hope, that a second run will solve the problem.

goodby

hello,
on one system, i must emerge some update manual because they block ware blocked while they use some old lib-versions.

this packages makes problems:
x11-libs/gdk-pixbuf
media-gfx/gimp
media-libs/libraw
media-libs/jasper

it was no problem to install all package with emerge every singe package, but with emerge --keep-going --backtrack=100 --exclude grub --verbose-conflicts @world this packages and some other blocks with installed package need old libs.

it was not nessassary to unmerge a package or merge it with nodeps, all blocking package can merged one after an other without problems in the new version.

such problems makes every time much work and don't make happy.

please install first the new libs and then new packages or packages which need reinstall while the version of a lib is changed.

i don't remeber all packages, i must see, that my system is running again and that the updates crash my system while it produce over 18000 zombies don't make me happy. but it seems, that after a reboot and kernel update to 4.9.23 all works fine at the moment. with kernel 3.18.49 one ore more of my raids are blocked and hangs.

never change a running system is very true, but sometime updates are nessassary.

goodby

ps: next update and next problems come in the future

It is sad to read that you have problems with the software. 
We can not help you efficiently via bug tracker. The bug tracker aims rather on specific problems in .ebuilds and less on individual systems. 

I have had very good experience on the gentoo IRC [1] and stackexchange with questions like this. Of course there are also forums and mailing lists [2,3,4].
I hope you understand, that I will close the bug here therefore and wish you good luck on one of the mentioned channels.

Especially on the Perl topic, read [5]. There had been a non trivial upgrade recently.

I close the ticket here, because I can not see a specific problem with an ebuild here and we can not discuss in a bug tracker. I hope I could help you with the links.

hello,
this is no ebuild-problem, this is a problem of the order, i which updates are installed or that some update can be installed alone, but not with an global update.

if perl is updated, then texinfo must be remerged and if packages are updated, which need a funktional texinfo to build, this packages will fail.

i don't know, if this is while some depencies are missing as sample gdb need texinfo and texinfo need all this perl-modul or only the order in which emerge update/reinstall the packages is false.

i can check the depencies, but if this are right, i don't know, how i can change the order in which the packages will be installed.

at the moment, if pearl or posible other package with the same problem is updated, it is nessasary to run the whole update more then one time to get all packages updated.

i hope, that you understand the problem. i have write this in bugzilla to help others which have also such problems on every update of specific packages.

i don't need help for this problems. i have no problems to solve such and other problems and i get a system up to date, which was upated last for two years or so. and this make much problems while portage wasn't updatable with emerge. i must many packages merge as single package and unmerge many packages to get emerge --depclean running and after that, i must install some packages with emerge -e1 so that the whole system is compiled and i see, that the depencies are not all cleaned and i must unmerge some other packages to get emerge -e1 running. i am not stoppable by such problems.

goodby
