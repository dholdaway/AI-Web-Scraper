After emerge -uD world, some applications started failing, kde arts could not
start soundserver, su could not find a module, etc. Turns out that pam was not
updated. Doing an emerge -s ^pam showed that an update was ready, but it was not
coming in.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge -uD world (on 2005-07-08)
2. log in as user
3. su or start kde

Actual Results:  
su shows module not found error
kde's arts cannot start soundserver: permission denied on device default

Expected Results:  
both should work and and pam 0.78 should be emerged

Marking as major since pam-0.78 really should be emerged

pam-0.78-r2 is not masked stable for most arcs (I presume you are an x86 user).
Reemerge the package that complains, or run revdep-rebuild to fix your system if
you have lots of programs that is unable to link to .so files.

My tree just got 0.78-r2 marked stable.

How does

emerge -uDpt sys-apps/pam-login look for you?

This morning, when I ran emerge -uD world, both shadow-4.0.7-r2 and
pam-login-3.17 were emerged. Pam-0.78 was not part of the mix. This, I think
caused the malfunction. revdep-rebuild showed nothing out of the ordinary other
than the usual openoffice.bin and firefox.bin which is expected. I am sure this
is just a transient problem, but I wanted to report it anyway. For me, I had to
manually emerge -u pam. And yes, I have x86.

Hmm, we can't really find the cause of the problem now that you've upgraded man
manually. Closing.
