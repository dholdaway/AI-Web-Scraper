 Inside Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
Operating margin decreased 10 basis points to 8.7% compared to the prior fiscal year; Consolidated net earnings for the fiscal year decreased $1.0 million, or 0.6%, to $184.6 million; Diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year were $1.69 compared to $1.66 for the prior fiscal year; and Cash provided by operations was $249.3 million for the fiscal year compared to $156.5 million for the prior fiscal year.



 Other - Other   Highlight
The increase was further driven by an increase in cash and cash equivalents, fewer outstanding borrowings under our ABL facility, a reduction in our accounts payable due to the timing of payments, and impacts of optimization efforts around inventory purchases.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Unallocated SG&A expenses, which represent certain corporate costs that have not been charged to our reporting segments, increased $18.4 million, or 10.3%, to $197.5 million, primarily due to higher wage and bonus - 30 - expenses, insurance costs and information technology expenses.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
BSGs gross profit decreased as a result of lower net sales, while BSGs gross margin was unchanged.

 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
Historical Cash Flows The following table shows our sources and uses of cash for the periods presented (in thousands): Operating Activities The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2023, compared to fiscal year 2022, was primarily driven by fewer inventory purchases in the current year as a result of the Plan and the additional inventory purchases related to BSG's growth through distribution partnerships in the prior fiscal year.
