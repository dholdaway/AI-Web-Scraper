In the admittedly large leap from Asterisk 1.2 to Asterisk 1.6; your keywords were dropped. Would you be able to test & keyword ~arch:
>=dev-libs/iksemel-1.4
>=net-libs/libpri-1.4.9
>=net-dialup/misdnuser-1.1.7.2
>=net-dialup/radiusclient-ng-0.5.6
>=net-misc/dahdi-2.2.1.1
>=net-misc/dahdi-tools-2.2.0-r1
>=media-libs/spandsp-0.0.6_pre7

If you are able to build Asterisk with all USE-flags enabled, and it starts & stops without errors/warnings on the default configs supplied, that is a successful test.
The longer-term plans with Asterisk are to stable 1.6 and then remove 1.2 from the tree. I am available on IRC & e-mail if you have any questions for me.

Users, please note that a stabilisation bug is *not* an appropriate location for pings or other messages. File a separate report and assign to me.

Feel free to drop the alpha/sparc keywords when the time come.

I've never used or properly tested this, no known HPPA users, feel free to drop us.

Feel free to drop the ppc keywords. If we have some users of asterisk, I'd be happy to re-keyword if asked.

Thank you all. Security bug #352059 will now be stabling 1.4 and dropping 1.2
