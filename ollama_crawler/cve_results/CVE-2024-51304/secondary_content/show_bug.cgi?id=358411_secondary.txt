Description

The ebuild for app-doc/linux-gazette-all does not install issues 2 through 8.  The ebuild tries to specify issues below 10 with a pattern, but uses "{1,9}" instead of "{1..9}", and thus does not install all issues.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge app-doc/linux-gazette-all
Actual Results:  
Installs issues 1, 9, 10-current

Expected Results:  
Install all issues
