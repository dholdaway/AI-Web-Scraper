sys-fs/udev-124-r2 starts /etc/init.d/net.nas0, which must starts manually after adsl-modem finished initial training, and only after this, net.ppp0 starts.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

Actual Results:  
br2684ctl starts, but ADSL-line is not established and therefore net.nas0 does not starts properly

Expected Results:  
net.nas0 and net.ppp0 starts sequentally by hand

please add "nas*"-interface to this block in "/lib/udev/net.sh":

# ignore interfaces that are registered after being "up" (?)
case ${IFACE} in
        ppp*|ippp*|isdn*|plip*|lo*|irda*|dummy*|ipsec*|tun*|tap*)
                exit 0 ;;
esac

P.S.: What's up with the braces count (I see close brace but not start brace)?

That's normal syntax for the "case" command in bash...

This will be added to next udev version/ebuild.
Do we need a custom setting in /etc/conf.d/udev, which interfaces to ignore additionally (to not need to wait for the ebuild to be updated), or is it enough to be able to block these with rc_hotplug="!net.xxx*"

Reporter: Is this bug valid still for =sys-fs/udev-197-r2 which is being stabilized?

And reply to last comment while at it, please.
