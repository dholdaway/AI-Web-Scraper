Description


Andreas Nüßlein

I would like to use binpkgs but I find it rather dirty to use either "getbinpkg" (while not having a BINHOST set) or make an alias to "emerge -k".
 
I would find it convenient if i could simply set "usepkg" in FEATURES.

Thanks a lot

Reproducible: Always

You can simply set EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS="--usepkg" in /etc/make.conf.
