Well, to have /etc/portage/package.keywords to work properly,
I'd like to know why the online package database shows nut in sys-power and 
emerge shows it in www-apps. If is stays in www-apps, that would be ok.
The only remaining confusion then is about online db and emerge not being consistent.

Greetings,
Robert

There's no www-apps/nut any more, it's been moved to sys-power/nut. Don't know what package database are you talking about, sorry.

Sorry, etc/portage/rsync_excludes was set for sys-power so I expect to have the problem solved after next --sync.

Just trying to keep rsync traffic small ;)

Thx,
Robert
