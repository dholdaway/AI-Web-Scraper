Reproducible: Always




I suspect this is an upstream problem, as I get the same error when trying to compile org.el manually.

Seems to have been a temporary problem with one version of Emacs 23.0.50 from CVS (approximately Nov 15, 2007).  After updating Emacs CVS, org-mode builds correctly.

Reopening for proper closing.
