I use k3b for burning. Everything seemed to work fine until I wanted to burn a video-dvd on my plextor px-708a with verbatim dvd+r media. The data seemed to be alright, but when finishing the dvd (the lead-out) k3b reported that growisofs didn't exit cleanly. I tried some data-dvd, audio-cd and data-cd, and I can burn cd's without problems, only when burning dvd's the error occurs. The disc is readable in my burner, as well as in my second computer's burner, but all dvd-rom and standalone dvd-players can't read this disc. After manipulating some settings, I realized that the multisession option set to no multisession gets k3b/growisofs to burn data-dvd's as expected. But this option is missing on video-dvd's (it should be set automatically, shouln't it?).

I run k3b 0.12.10 and dvd+rw-tools 6.1, but I tried k3b 0.12.8 and dvd+rw-tools 5.21 (the latest stable versions) as well, with the same result. After burning several coasters I tried to do the same thing on my amd64 box (k3b 0.12.10 and dvd+rw-tools 5.21 with plextor px-716a). Everything worked fine here (settings on multisession doesn't make a difference). I guess this is a problem with the combination of dvd+rw-tools and some specific burners (I read about some pioneer burners that alsa have some problems, but afaik they should have been fixed in dvd+rw-tools 6.1).

I hope someone can help me on this one, it's really annoying! Here are my output of k3b and my emerge --info):

Maybe I should say that I use verbatim dvd+rw now to check what works and what doesn't because I produced enough coasters the last days. This is why k3b says write extended at ...

Thx

After a few tries with the newly releases k3b 0.12.11 and dvd+rw-tools 6.1 the problem seems to be fixed. Both video-dvd and data-dvd were burnt successfully
 with my px-708a. So this was likely a bug in k3b, because I didn't change anything than update k3b.

Bug resolved.

Thank you.
