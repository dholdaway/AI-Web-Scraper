Description


Robert Golding





          2006-11-12 18:21:19 UTC
        

I installed Openoffice (after uninstalling openoffice-bin) and found I had no access to my PCF fonts.  I tried to run "oopadmin" then "spadmin" but they don't seem to exist with this build.

Perhaps that is the bug, "OOo printer admin" missing?

All these fonts were accessible in openoffice-bin, and Printer Admin also existed with openoffice-bin, so I could, If I needed to, manually install missing fonts.

They are also available in InkScape, The GIMP and I can see them in the Gnome Font selector, so Xorg is supplying them.

The only bug I found in search (#79570) is Resolved-Invalid, with this post:
<------- Comment #1 From Andreas Proschofsky  2005-01-26 07:30 PST  [reply] -------

OpenOffice is not supposed to find all your fonts, the official way to add
fonts IS to add them through oopadmin, so this is not a bug.

But: I've modified the wrapper a few days ago, so all fonts in /usr/share/fonts
should be added automatically in the future, this also works for me with the
baekmuk-fonts. If you want to have that behaviour please emerge sync and
re-merge openoffice.

Closing

I also found only one post in the forums similar to this;

Sorry about that, I was halfway through the report when my system had a power failure. When I restarted, then resumed the session in Firefox, it opened up on the entry page exactly where I was before it shutdown.  

I am assuming that is what caused the double commit, though I did only click on commit once, go figure :-)

There is no printer admin anymore, fonts that are in /usr/share/fonts or in ~/.fonts are auto-detected now, so no need for this stuff. To be able to reproduce your problem, please specify which package provides your Helvetica fonts

Yesterday I installed and then un-installed openoffice-bin-2.0.3 and it had a printer admin link from the menu.  I checked and it still had the same layout, printer window, properties and fonts button along bottom.  
I have been playing around with complete system rebuild variations and the OO-bin package was default, before I took it out to install the source package I noted the fonts were there, but the sizes and hinting were all wrong (separate issue -fixed)

I load all my personal fonts into (Type1 and ttf) /usr/share/fonts/local/, however the Helvetica, Courier, Times and other PCF are already on the system in the /usr/share/fonts/100dpi & 75dpi dirs as pcf.gz, so I don't know what package puts them there, I had always assumed it to be Xorg/XFree86 as part of the base package.

I use Fontconfig, not XFS.

Still can't reproduce this problem, looks like a local font setup problem. As I said before: openoffice and openoffice-bin handle font stuff differently...

I have kept OOo up to date and I'm at 2.3.0 (yesterday) and still have the problem of NO helvetica (or any of the other PCF fnts) in Openoffice ONLY.

It is available in EVERY other package that allows font change on my system, such as Scribus, Gimp, Gnome, KDE, Enlightenment (the system has five users who all like different wm's), KOffice and even in the new IBM Lotus Symphony (thought I'd give it a look).

The only fix for me is to use the bin package, however, I don't want to, I prefer to use compiled packages where-ever possible, call an affectation if you will 8^)>

It almost seems as if the OOo compiled package only uses the TTF's available on the system.

Also, I am not going to use XFS, I understand it is being fazed out, so I haven't even tried it.

Is this still a valid problem for you?

Not really, I havn't bothered with trying to fix it at all.  I bought a TTF version of Helvetica from a font house and then when I updated OOo to 2.2 it was fixed.

I'm sorry, however, I had forgotten all about this bug report being in the system.
You can leave it as resolved - WORKSFORME IF YOU WILL.
