I have 3.3.2 installed and had changed its theme and style over to Reluna (from kde-look.) When I upgraded to the 3.4.0 kde I did not get the lipstik style on my system and my theme was still Reluna. I think the theme staying the same is fine (it kept my settings, good.) But I want to have the default 3.4 theme and style, and neither of them got installed on my system.

Any ideas?

EDIT: The icons and the window decorations didnt get installed either. So none of the kde appearance stuff seemed to be installed with my upgrade...

I want the icons, I want the theme, and I want the style. I can get the lipstik style from kde-look I guess, but that doesnt have the rest of it. 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~x86" emerge kde
2. /etc/init.d/xdm restart
3. login to kde 3.4

Actual Results:  
KDE 3.4 came up looking exactly like my 3.3.2 did (with the reluna theme i got
from kde-look.)  And that is fine, it should keep my look and feel.  But I want
the chance to switch to the default everything for 3.4 and I think it should all
be there?

Expected Results:  
I should be able to select the lipstik style and the default 3.4 theme and the
default 3.4 icons and window decorations.

Are you saying that the "Plastik" style and windows decorations, and the "Crystal SVG" icons are not available in Control Center?

It didnt have them the first time.  I am not sure how/why it helped but I reinstalled it again and they came up this time.  So who knows...
