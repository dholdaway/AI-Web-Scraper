 Inside Krispy Kreme, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Debt   Highlight
If we are unable to meet the 2023 Facility financial or other covenants in future periods, it may negatively impact our liquidity by limiting our ability to draw on the revolving credit facility, could result in the lenders accelerating the maturity of such indebtedness and foreclosing upon the collateral pledged thereunder, and could require the replacement of the 2023 Facility with new sources of financing, which there is no guaranty we could secure.



 Financial - Income   Highlight
However, deferred tax assets could be reduced in the near term if our estimates of taxable income are significantly reduced or tax strategies are no longer viable.

 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
We establish reserves for uncertain tax positions for material, known tax exposures in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes relating to deductions, transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the measurement and recognition of the item.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
While we believe that our reserves are adequate, issues raised by a tax authority may be resolved at an amount different than the related reserve and could materially increase or decrease our income tax provision in future periods.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Operating expenses: Operating expenses increased $72.3 million, or 10.3%, from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023, driven mainly by labor cost inflation and investments to support growth.
