This is definitely no free software (it's even mirror restricted), so it shouldn't be labelled as such. LICENSE="as-is" is not correct.

the downloadable firmware comes with diffrent license models

####
For all the Conexant firmwares, it applies the following license:

  Conexant grants permission to use and redistribute these firmware
  files for use with Conexant devices, but not as a part of the Linux
  kernel or in any other form which would require these files themselves
  to be covered by the terms of the GNU General Public License.

  useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty
  of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

TORTIOUS ACTION, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR
PERFORMANCE OF THIS SOFTWARE.

####
The files are named dvb-ttpci-VV.fw-vvvv

  VV : Version of firmware-to-host API. You can simply upgrade
       the firmware binary with a newer one of the same API
       version without changing anything else in the driver.
  vvvv: Firmware version. Increased with each functional change.

It is recommended that you use the newest firmware binary
compatible with your driver. If you use the hotplug firmware loader
in Linux 2.6 you must put the firmware file in
/lib/firmware/dvb-ttpci-01.fw (in previous versions of the Linux
hotplug scripts it was /usr/lib/hotplug/firmware/dvb-ttpci-01.fw).

Boot.S is the source for the boot loader which is included
as a binary blob in the bootcode array in av7110_hw.c in
the Linux driver source. For more information check the
driver tarball at http://www.metzlerbros.org/dvb/.

####
TERRATEC grants permission to use and redistribute these firmware
files for use with TERRATEC devices, but not as part of the Linux
kernel or in any other form which would require these files themselves
to be covered by the terms of the GNU General Public License.

These firmware files are distributed in the hope that they will be
useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty
of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Iam not shure, can we cover alle different licenses with

LICENSE="all-rights-reserved"


btw. if this bug is fixed/closed
the package should be moved to CATEGORY sys-firmware...

Does the above (Conexant, Xceive, DiBcom, Metzler, and Terratec) cover all of the files? Then we could just add it as new license file.

The DiBcom part is the ISC license, by the way.

Sorry I am no longer interested in this package. It was only saved from removal because I kept it in shape somehow for some time. After I got tired I tried to remove it from portage myself but was not allowed to anymore. So others have to keep the pieces now. I vote for removing this package and give the users instructions on how to acquire the relevant files themselves.

How shall we proceed here? It seems to me that the package in its current form isn't really useful, because several of the SRC_URIs have fetch failures. Not sure how users are supposed to install it.

Maybe it would be better to split it into separate packages, one for each upstream? (These could be in the sys-firmware category then.)

Or we simply follow this suggestion.

For the time being, I've changed LICENSE to "freedist ISC all-rights-reserved". Please note that this is a rough approximation only.

In case this package should be split into several packages, or reorganised in any other way, the license issue should be reiterated.
