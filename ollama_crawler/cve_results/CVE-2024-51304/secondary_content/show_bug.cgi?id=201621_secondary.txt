After a kernel upgrade to 2.6.23-gentoo-r3 from 2.6.22-gentoo-r9 Klive emerge "somepackage" or revdep-rebuild just returned these: ">>>" in new line. If I type help I get welcomed to Python 2.4 online documentation.
I got this problem with Klive bootup script too.
If I reboot back to 2.6.22-r9 everything works OK.
I reemerged python but no changes.
I used my old config from 2.6.22-r9 to compile 2.6.23-r3
I tried kernel 2.6.24-rc2-mm1 but no changes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Boot kernel 2.6.23-gentoo-r3
2.  emerge -s ltsp
3.

Actual Results:

>>> is a python shell. This has nothing to do w/ kernel upgrade and please note that this is not a support forum.

Sorry to waste your time.
I'm aware that this shouldn't be connected with kernel upgrade, and am very confused.
I asked on #gentoo and was redirected here.
As I wrote only by changing the kernel in grub from 2.6.22 to 2.6.23 makes emerge exit to python shell, and by changing back it works again. Only kernel change, nothing else.

Thanks for your time
