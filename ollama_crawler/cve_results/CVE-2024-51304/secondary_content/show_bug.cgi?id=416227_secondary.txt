Description

While booting I got errors:
sh: /etc/splash/livedvd-12.0/scripts/rc_exit-post: Permission denied
sh: /etc/splash/livedvd-12.0/scripts/rc_init-pre: Permission denied

After
chmod a+x /etc/splash/livedvd-12.0/scripts/*
everything is ok.

Confirming, just had the same problem on ~amd64, `chmod +x` fixed it.

The problem is gone now, because the ebuild was recently fixed, see bug 447632.
