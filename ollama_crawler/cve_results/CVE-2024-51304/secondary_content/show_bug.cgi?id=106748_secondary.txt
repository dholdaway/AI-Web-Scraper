Emerging libgdiplus-1.1.9 on my system failed:

Making all in src
make[5]: Entering directory
`/var/tmp/portage/libgdiplus-1.1.9/work/libgdiplus-1.1.9/cairo/pixman/src'
if /bin/sh ../../libtool --tag=CC --mode=compile i686-pc-linux-gnu-gcc

libtool: unrecognized option `--tag=CC'
Try `libtool --help' for more information.
--[snip]--
!!! ERROR: dev-dotnet/libgdiplus-1.1.9 failed.
!!! Function src_compile, Line 56, Exitcode 2

The error message suggests that the "--tag" option support is needed.  My
current version of libtool was libtool-1.4.1-r10, which apparently doesn't
support that.  After upgrading libtool to libtool-1.5.18-r1, emerging libgdiplus
succeeded.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Emerge libgdiplus with libtool-1.4.1-r10
2. Watch it fail

Actual Results:  
It failed

Expected Results:  
Not failed

Ebuild for libgdiplus should probably just require a newer libtool version.  I'm
not sure which version introduced the "--tag" option though.

Not in portage at all, removed 10 month ago... Upgrade your system before
reporting bugs, please.

Ok, for future reference -- is there any way I'm supposed to know that my
libtool needed to be upgraded?  Isn't that the whole point of dependency
tracking in the ebuilds?  Or is there some easy way for me to check if I have
versions of packages that are no longer in portage (without doing it per package)?

Thanks

At the very least : emerge -DuN system
but better (imho) would be : emerge -DuavNt world
man portage will tell you what the options actually mean.
