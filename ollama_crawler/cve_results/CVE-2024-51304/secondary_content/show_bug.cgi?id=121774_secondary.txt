Description

Per CPAN and URL above Config::General is now at version 2.31

Oh, the correct URL for the author's site is http://www.daemon.de/ConfigGeneral although it may be preferable to link to the the CPAN page for it, http://search.cpan.org/~tlinden/Config-General-2.31/General.pm (hm - maybe not - that's versioned)

Should dev-perl/config-general be renamed to dev-perl/Config-General to match the mapping to the fact it's in CPAN as Config::General?

Oops. That was stupid - config-general 2.31 is already in Portage. Sorry. eix needs an update run, apparently.

The question about the name and the comment about the URL remain pertinent. Changing summary.

Renaming ebuilds is a major PITA.
