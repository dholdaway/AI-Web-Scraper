net-misc/iputils-20071127 did not install man pages and fix is without revbump, so that most users will still be without man pages for ping, arping and so on until a version bump comes along whenever that might be...
Please revbump iputils-20071127 to propagate the man page installation fix or consider making a version bump to propagate it (updating the snapshot if reasonable?).

it's always been this way: if you wanted man pages, you had to build with USE=doc.  including the man pages wasnt really a fix.

if you care so much, feel free to bump it yourself.
