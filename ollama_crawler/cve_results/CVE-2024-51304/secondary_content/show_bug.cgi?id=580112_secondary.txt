Hi! I noticed that Vivaldi binary file is hosted in another URL which is faster than that is in the ebuild. For example, in the ebuild is:
http://vivaldi.com/download/stable/vivaldi-stable_1.0.435.42-1_amd64.deb

The correct and faster URL must be:

http://download.vivaldi.com/stable/vivaldi-stable_1.0.435.42-1_amd64.deb

to avoid the redirection.

Thanks.

Reproducible: Always

not because it's "faster" or any crap like that, but it looks like v.c is an internal redirect through CF, so we should avoid that if it isn't necessary.

For *me*

http://vivaldi.com/download/stable/vivaldi-stable_1.0.435.42-1_amd64.deb

does a redirect to

https://vivaldi.com/download/stable/vivaldi-stable_1.0.435.42-1_amd64.deb

and

http://vivaldi.com/download/snapshot/vivaldi-snapshot_1.1.453.6-1_amd64.deb

does a redirect to

https://vivaldi.com/download/snapshot/vivaldi-snapshot_1.1.453.6-1_amd64.deb

so that means their CDN is at work here, and YMMV.
