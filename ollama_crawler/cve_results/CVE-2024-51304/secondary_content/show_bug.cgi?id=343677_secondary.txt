According to ConTeXt README on http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Read_Me the code is GPL-2 and the documentation is CC-NC-SA-2.5.

Did anyone check if dev-texlive/texlive-context has the appropriate license line?

It currently (in version 2010) reads:
LICENSE="GPL-2 as-is FDL-1.1 GPL-1 GPL-2 public-domain "

The license in the ebuild comes from what texlive provides... why do you _want_ someone to check the license when you didn't even bother to ?

I did. And I posted here what I found out. I'm just asking if anyone is more informed then what I found out in the official ConTeXt README.

texlive-context is context packaged for texlive, by texlive upstream. They take care of the license issues and remove these packages that come with an incompatible, they may add some other packages that they see fit well in the texlive-context (or any other) collection, so imho, context readme doesnt help much here; if you want to do a license review then you should review every single file that is provided by the ebuild.
