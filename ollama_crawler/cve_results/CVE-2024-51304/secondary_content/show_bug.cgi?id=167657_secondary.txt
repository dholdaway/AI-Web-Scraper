avenj and kloeri are already present during the attack to Diego, I checked the buglist and looks like there aren't any open about geoman retirement even if I read enough times about his will to retire.

The keywords here are "twat" and "fuckhead", after a request of not keywording a group of ebuild slated for removal.

I'm not sure about the full etiquette, you could mark it as LATER if you deem that the Ombudsman should give a try.

I put the people involved and few people interested on the issue in the CC list

I'm again without computer, so I can not see the scrollback.  Is it possible for you guys to attach a larger log?

Don't waste your time with this bullshit, I already said I'm retiring.  Please retire me, I have not had time for Gentoo for months now.
