Description


Piotr Gabryjeluk





          2006-09-01 07:48:29 UTC
        

First of all, I've noticed that

net-firewall/firestarter-1.0.3

compiles fine but works only when

net-firewall/iptables-1.3.5-r1

is compiled with extensions in USE.

Second problem is that seting up an DHCP server with Firestarter creates a dhcp.conf file in /etc/dhcpd.conf instead of /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf. When I move the file to /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf I can then /etc/init.d/dhcp start and this works great.

[ebuild   R   ] net-firewall/iptables-1.3.5-r1  USE="-extensions -ipv6 -static" 0 kB

Works fine here.
