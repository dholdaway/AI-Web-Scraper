Description

Hi,

in my /etc/conf.d/net i have:

config_eth0 = ("null")

bridge_xenbr0 = "eth0"
config_xenbr0 = ( "dhcp" )
...


As you can see, eth0 is part of a bridge. Starting ifplugd/netplug is totally unwanted. And actually config_eth0=("null") has the meaning to me, that the interface eth0 is not touched at all.

So please don't start ifplugd/netplug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

I can also confirm, that unplugging the cable is really harmfull:

As i unplugged the cable of eth0, the bridge lost its hardware-address. So in the background, something harmfull happened, since the ifplugd/netplug was running.

config_eth0=( "null")

means don't assign an address.

Put this in /etc/conf.d/net to stop netplug and ifplugd

modules=( "!plug" )
