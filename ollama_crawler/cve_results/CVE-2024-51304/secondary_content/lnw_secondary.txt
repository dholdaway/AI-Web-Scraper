 Inside Light Wonder, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Legal - Other   Highlight
Potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of legal liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.



 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
While we believe our estimates of future operating results and projected cash flows are reasonable, any significant adverse changes in key assumptions (i.e., adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used or expectation that, more likely than not, an asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its useful life) or adverse changes in economic and market conditions may cause a change in our evaluation of recoverability or our estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge that could be material to our financial statements.

 Legal - Other   Highlight
These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Such impacts have in some cases been material and could be material in the future should they continue.

 Other - Other   Highlight
While we have not yet seen an impact on our business from current events, they could negatively affect the performance of the personnel in that area and have an adverse impact on our business if these events continue and/or escalate.
