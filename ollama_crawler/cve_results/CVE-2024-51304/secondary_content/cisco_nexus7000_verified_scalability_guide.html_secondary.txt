 To make the best use
                  		of this document, please take note of the following: 
                  	 
               


All numbers are
                        			 per system unless noted otherwise. For example, a listed number of FCoE fabric
                        			 logins can be in a single VDC or be a sum of fabric logins across all VDCs in
                        			 the system. Any changes in the number of supported VDCs do not automatically
                        			 imply changes in the supported scale for other features. 
                        		  
                     


If the latest
                        			 release has an updated value for a parameter but the previous release does not,
                        			 specific information for the previous release is not available. 
                        		  
                     


If a release is
                        			 not listed in a specific column in the configuration limits support table,
                        			 consider the scale numbers listed for the previous release. 
                        		  
                     


The values
                        			 provided in this guide are uni-dimensional. They focus on the scalability of
                        			 one particular feature at a time. Results might differ from the values listed
                        			 here when trying to achieve maximum scalability with multiple features enabled.
                        			 
                        		  
                     


The values
                        			 provided in this guide should not be interpreted as theoretical system limits
                        			 for Cisco Nexus 7000 Series and Cisco Nexus 7700 Series hardware or Cisco NX-OS
                        			 software. These limits refer to values that have been validated by Cisco. They
                        			 can increase over time as more testing and validation is done. 
                        		  
                     


 Cisco NX-OS
                        			 Release 6.1 introduced support for Cisco Nexus 7000 Supervisor 2 and Supervisor
                        			 2e. Supervisor 2e is designed to provide the highest software scalability. If a
                        			 higher uni-dimensional scale is verified on Supervisor 2e, the scale values for
                        			 each supervisor will be listed using the following notation: Supervisor 1
                        			 value/Supervisor 2 value/Supervisor 2e value. If Supervisor 2e is not verified
                        			 to provide a higher uni-dimensional scale for a particular feature parameter, a
                        			 single scalability value will be listed for all supervisors. 
                        			 
                        

Note




Supervisor 2e is strongly recommended in multi-dimensional scalability scenarios, particularly when multiple VDCs are used
                                          and the Cisco NX-OS version deployed is 6.2 or above.  From Cisco NX-OS Release 8.3(1) onwards either Supervisor 2e/Supervisor
                                          3 is recommended for the above scenario.









 Cisco NX-OS
                        			 Release 6.2 introduced support for Cisco Nexus 7700 switches. Supervisor 2e
                        			 running on Cisco Nexus 7700 switches provides the same software scalability as
                        			 Supervisor 2e running on Cisco Nexus 7000 switches. 
                        		  
                     


Cisco NX-OS
                        			 Release 7.2(1)D1(1) introduced support for scale limit monitoring on Cisco
                        			 Nexus 7000 Supervisor 2 and Supervisor 2E and on Cisco Nexus 7700 switches. The
                        			 Scale Limit Monitoring feature enables you to monitor the scale limit both at
                        			 the system level and the VDC level. This feature monitors the scale limits for
                        			 various features across different VDCs on the device and alerts you if the
                        			 system crosses the permissible scale limit.

Note






To achieve the highest VLAN per Fabric Extender (FEX) port scale, Cisco recommends connecting FEX uplinks to one switch on
                                       chip (SoC) on F2/F2e or F3 series modules instead of spreading them across different SoCs. 
                                    


In Cisco NX-OS 7.3(0)D1(1) release, the number of Fabric Extenders in Active-Active mode is 32. 


In Cisco NX-OS 8.3(1) release, FEX does not support F4 series modules.

8 The maximum number of BFD multi-hop sessions supported is 100 if the sum of single-hop and multi-hop sessions on the system
                     is not greater than 1000. Which means, if there are already 950 BFD single-hop sessions, then only 50 BFD multi-hop sessions
                     are supported.
                  




Note






For peers over Layer 3 link or Layer 3 port channel with per-link mode, the recommended minimum interval is 50 msec and the
                                       multiplier value is 3.
                                    


For peers over Layer 2 port channel and Layer 3 port channel without per-link mode, the recommended minimum interval is 250
                                       msec and the multiplier value is 3.

Note





For the highest vPC scalability, Cisco recommends deploying MST and Supervisor 2e/Supervisor3. For scenarios with 4000 VLANs
                                    and SVIs and HSRP, Cisco recommends using the M2 Series modules. 
                                 
* Supervisor 1 modules
                                    				are supported only in Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(x) and earlier.

Beginning with
                           				Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2, the number of sessions can be all IPv4, all IPv6, or a
                           				mix of both. 
                           			 
                        


For the highest per-module scale, Cisco recommends using the M2, M3, F2, F2e, or F3 Series modules. 


For the highest per-system scale, Cisco recommends using Supervisor 2e/Supervisor 3 module.

Note



 The F2, F2e, F3, anx F4 modules synchronize the MAC address tables for a VLAN across all Switch on Chips (SoCs) present in
                           a virtual device context (VDC) when a switch virtual interface (SVI) for the VLAN is configured. Synchronizing the MAC address
                           tables can reduce the number of MAC addresses supported in a VDC to the number of MAC addresses supported in one Switch on
                           Chip, which is16,000 for F2/F2e I/O module and 64,000 for F3/F4 I/O module.

Each MPLS
                           				L2VPN scale value might vary when combined with other parameters. 
                           			 
                        


For VPLS, the
                           				more sites that are used, the fewer VFIs and bridge domains that can be
                           				supported due to the increased number of pseudo-wires to connect sites in a
                           				full mesh. 
                           			 
                        




Guidelines and
                     		  Limitations for MPLS L3VPN Configuration Limits
                  


Each MPLS
                           				L3VPN scale value might vary when combined with other parameters. See examples
                           				of scenarios tested with Supervisor 2e running Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2 for

The following
                           				scenarios were tested in a single VDC as well as in VRFs broken up across four
                           				VDCs. 85% of the routes were local, and 15% were remote.

Guidelines and
                     		  Limitations for IP SLA Configuration Limits
                  


To achieve the
                           				highest IP SLA probe scale, you might need to add a specific CoPP configuration
                           				to allow the IP SLA generated packets to pass through. Otherwise, probes might
                           				experience timeouts. See the 
                           				Cisco
                              				  Nexus 7000 Series NX-OS IP SLAs Configuration Guide 
                              				 for more details. 
                           			 
                        


Even if CoPP
                           				is not dropping any IP SLA traffic, round-trip times (RTTs) might vary, so it
                           				is important to test locally and set the proper timeout value for IP SLA
                           				probes. Generally, Cisco does not recommend setting the IP SLA probe timeout
                           				below 1 second. 
                           			 
                        


Cisco recommends using Supervisor 2e/Supervisor 3 to achieve the highest scale and the lowest RTT for IP SLA probes. 




Guidelines and
                     		  Limitations for SPAN Configuration Limits
                  
The number of SPAN
                     		  sessions refers to unidirectional sessions. On the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series
                     		  switch, two SPAN extended sessions can be combined to create a bidirectional
                     		  session, and a SPAN standard session can behave either as unidirectional or
                     		  bidirectional. The Cisco Nexus 7700 switch does not have standard and extended
                     		  sessions. All SPAN sessions are unidirectional, and any two can be combined to
                     		  create a bidirectional session. See the 
                     		  Cisco Nexus
                        			 7000 Series NX-OS System Management Configuration Guide for more
                     		  information.

35  With each new VDC configured, the number of configurable VRFs is reduced by two as each VDC has a default VRF and management
                     VRFs that are not removable. For example, with 4 configured VDCs on Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2, you can configure up to 3992
                     additional VRFs (either all in one VDC or across VDCs).,
                  
36 Not all dynamic routing protocols can support having peers in all of the supported VRFs. Refer to the individual protocol
                     scale for more information.
                  




Note




EIGRP scale was dropped to 200 in release 8.0(1) due to a crash issue and fixed in release 8.2(1). Now the EIGRP neighbor
                                 scale is raised to 2000 from release 8.2(1) onwards.
                              







Note




For BGP, you must consider FIB Scale as the final parameter. BGP Prefixes will hit the FIB scale limit.

Guidelines and
                     		  Limitations for All Unicast Routing Configuration Limits
                  


 High availability (graceful restart, stateful switchover, and ISSU) is not supported when protocol aggressive timers are
                           configured at any scale. 
                        




Guidelines and
                     		  Limitations for OSPF Configuration Limits
                  


Cisco recommends using Supervisor 2e/Supervisor 3 module for the highest scale and fastest convergence. 


To achieve the
                           				highest scale, Cisco recommends using a single OSPF instance instead of
                           				multiple instances. 
                           			 
                        


Each OSPFv2
                           				and OSPFv3 scale value might vary when combined with other parameters. See
                           				examples of scenarios tested for Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2 for better guidance.
                           				All scenarios were tested with a single OSPF instance. 
                           			 
                        


The graceful
                           				restart timeout value might need to be increased in multi-dimensional
                           				scenarios. 
                           			 
                        


The passive
                           				interface default was used.

Guidelines and
                     		  Limitations for IS-IS Configuration Limits
                  


Cisco recommends using Supervisor 2e/Supervisor 3 module for the highest scale and fastest convergence. 


Each IS-IS
                           				scale value might vary when combined with other parameters. See these examples
                           				of scenarios tested for Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2 for better guidance. All
                           				scenarios were tested with a single IS-IS instance with IPv4 and IPv6 address
                           				families enabled on all peers and the total number of routes being a mix of
                           				IPv4 and IPv6 routes.

To achieve the
                           				highest scale with high availability, you must increase the graceful restart
                           				signal timer to 60 seconds.

Guidelines and

The number of
                           				HSRPv2 and VRRPv3 groups can be IPv4 only, IPv6 only, or a combination of both.
                           				For example, if Cisco NX-OS supports 4000 HSRP groups, it can also support 4000
                           				VLANs with each running HSRP IPv4 groups or 2000 dual-stacked VLANs. 
                           			 
                        


The same FHRP
                           				group ID or different group IDs can be used in different VLANs and within the
                           				same VLAN for IPv4 and IPv6 groups.
