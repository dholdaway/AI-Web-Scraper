Ok, I suppose this is trivial, but it wouldn't be nice if many apps would miss their desktop icon.

Uh, it's there for me, on all 3 systems I checked it on.

Then it is an exception I suppose. I have Gnome 2.14.2. Can you suggest me how to investigate the cause?

Have you tried remerging the package?

Sorry for a slow response.

Yes, I unmerged and emerged it again - I still don't have the icon. Nevermind, it's not really a problem...
