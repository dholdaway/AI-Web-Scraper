I just upgraded openssl and I see the following output:

Why are the bundled certificates broken, in first place? And, what am I supposed to do with this? ;-) Shouldn't that be handled by ebuild (to not install broken certificates)? And the other messages?

this was covered extensively in a previous bug

openssl doesn't install certs, the ca-certificates package does.  and when that installs, it tells you how to clean things:
  find -L /etc/ssl/certs/ -type l -exec rm {} +
