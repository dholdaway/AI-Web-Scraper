The webclients subdir in the sources contains the HTML5 or java files for implementing a web-based version of a VNC client

will add examples use flag next release.

and if you're going to add as CONFIRMED, assign it yourself.

afaict these are unnecessarily bundled files that are available as net-misc/tightvnc[java] and www-apps/novnc.

I'm using x11vnc and I have seen that it depends on libvncserver, this is the reason I opened this bug request. An user might potentially install the same software without having the java or novnc files. What about adding an einfo to the ebuild (in this case x11vnc)?

what do you mean? does x11vnc directly depend on those files, or is it just required for viewing?

they are required if you want to show the vnc session in a browser at port 5800 i.e. to use the -httpdir option which needs the java files.

By default they don't come with x11vnc and I found them looking in the libvncserver sources, probably an einfo during pkg_postinst() in the x11vnc ebuild should be enough to give the right hint to the user.

so, to be clear, x11vnc supports using some runtime files that are usually provided with libvncserver but can come from anywhere.

right, initially I have found those files inside libvncserver sources, later I have used those installed by tightvnc[java] as you suggested
