emerge --info output

The emerge of www-client/chromium-71.0.3578.80 fails because the system runs out of RAM, even though the RAM pre-compile check passes successfully. The system has 8GB of RAM.

Compiling with the default USE flags, except for the L10N.

Details: `[ebuild     U ] www-client/chromium-71.0.3578.80 [70.0.3538.67] USE="cups hangouts (pic) proprietary-codecs pulseaudio suid -component-build -custom-cflags -gnome-keyring -jumbo-build -kerberos (-neon) (-selinux) (-system-ffmpeg) (-system-icu) (-system-libvpx) (-tcmalloc) -widevine" L10N="-am -ar -bg -bn -ca -cs -da -de -el -en-GB -es -es-419 -et -fa -fi -fil -fr -gu -he -hi -hr -hu -id -it -ja -kn -ko -lt -lv -ml -mr -ms -nb -nl -pl -pt-BR -pt-PT -ro -ru -sk -sl -sr -sv -sw -ta -te -th -tr -uk -vi -zh-CN -zh-TW"`

Out of RAM message:

 * MemTotal:        8075736 kB
 * SwapTotal:       2097148 kB

I've tried to emerge it several times and with previous versions, getting errors in different points of the emerge but because of running out of RAM. The last version I could emerge is 70.0.3538.67

emerge --info output

You have eight gigabytes of RAM.

>KiB Mem:     8075736 total,   4052956 free

You want to run five make jobs.

>MAKEOPTS="-j5"

Each make job (e.g. a compiler or linker) could use about 2 gigabytes of memory, especially with C++ projects. This is not going to work.

Please lower the number of make jobs to something suitable.
