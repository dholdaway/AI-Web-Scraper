Description

all of the digests in media-video/mplayer/files call for a copy of

MD5 5fdc36704c4ec3a6dc6b57a536608180 Blue-1.4.tar.bz2 221734

But the current downloadable copy has a size of 221764 and an MD5 of

05dd8e4f11a715c9e5d2abf1cdeb907c

I recently built this package on FreeBSD where the same file had a length of
221733 and an md5 of e79ac5d48e46e118b4792dc1d371b2d2

It appears the package source keep changing this file, preserving the version
and leaving others to guess what's current

I have done a couple of emerge sync's to see if there is a portage update

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.emerge mplayer, then wait
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
# emerge mplayer

...
!!! Digest verification Failed:
!!!    /usr/portage/distfiles/Blue-1.4.tar.bz2
!!! Reason: Filesize does not match recorded size

Is still a problem?

I can confirm the problem with the current portage tree (30 Aug.)

The file size and md5sum of the file that I downloaded from ftp3.mplayerhq.hu
(one of the authoritative mplayer sites) are the same as those reported by Jim:

# md5sum Blue-1.4.tar.bz2
05dd8e4f11a715c9e5d2abf1cdeb907c  Blue-1.4.tar.bz2
# ls -l Blue-1.4.tar.bz2
-rw-r--r--  1 root portage 221764 Mar 25 15:42 Blue-1.4.tar.bz2

I just did a removal of my portage/media-video/mplayer directory, an emerge-synch, and still get the same problem as above.

Is there a workaround?  Can I manually update the checksums somewhere?

Marc,
You can work around this by using a cmd like
  ebuild /usr/portage/<category>/<package>/<package>-<version>.ebuild digest
 or
  ebuild /usr/portage/<category>/<package>/<package>-<version>.ebuild manifest

but reporting the problem here usually makes it get fixed quite fast.

Jim,
if this is fixed, would You mind to resolve the bug "fixed" or "invalid"?
