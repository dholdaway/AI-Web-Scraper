ASUS L5D is an AMD64 powered series of notebooks (anyway I'm running it at 32bit). From kernels >= 2.6.10 on, ACPI thermal zone stops to correctly report and update THRM temperature. While running, /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/temperature reports "always" the same degrees (-4 degrees from booting temp). This causes the system to badly manage notebook fans with the consequence of a very hot cpu. Sometimes the notebook automatically turns itself off (Termal protection).

This is the ACPI interesting part of the output from the dmsgs:
Linux vanilla (also gentoo patched) 2.6.9 - acpi v. 20040816
ACPI: AC Adapter [AC0] (on-line)
ACPI: Battery Slot [BAT0] (battery absent)
ACPI: Power Button (FF) [PWRP]
ACPI: Sleep Button (CM) [SLPB]
ACPI: Lid Switch [LID]
ACPI: Fan [FN00] (off)
ACPI: Processor [CPU1] (supports C1)
ACPI: Thermal Zone [THRM] (47 C)
--
Linux gentoo patched 2.6.10-gentoo-r7 - acpi v. 20041105
ACPI: AC Adapter [AC0] (on-line)
ACPI: Battery Slot [BAT0] (battery absent)
ACPI: Power Button (FF) [PWRP]
ACPI: Sleep Button (CM) [SLPB]
ACPI: Lid Switch [LID]
ACPI: Fan [FN00] (off)
ACPI: Video Device [VGA] (multi-head:yes rom:no post:no)
ACPI: Thermal Zone [THRM] (59 C)

Ok, with kernel 2.6.11-mm2 there is no problem. It seems to be related to 2.6.10 and 2.6.11-rc* kernels.
