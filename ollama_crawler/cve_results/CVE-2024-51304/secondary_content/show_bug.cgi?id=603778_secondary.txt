For some reason eix no more shows proper available version of packages on my machine. (Installed version is indicated properly in installation version line though).
Incremental run of eix-update does not help.
Version app-portage/eix-0.32.1-r1.

I don't think it's related but eix-remote update is not capable to reach dev.gentooexperimtal.org for cache of experimental repositories anymore.
I also use layman for adding specific repositories.

I guess your database needs to be rebuilt, or something like that.

Please contact our support channels to solve your problem.

I will close the bug now. Please reopen it, or create a new ticket if this is really a bug in gentoo and provide detailed information.
