Description

After upgrading to xorg-7.0.0_rc3, none of my browser plugins work. Neither in
Firefox (mozilla-firefox-1.0.7-r4) nor Epiphany (epiphany-1.8.3).

Have tested flash (netscape-flash-7.0.61) and java (sun-jdk-1.4.2.09) and in
both cases, the browser crashes. With the totem plugin, I get dialogs with
errors complaining that something else is playing multimedia.

Tell me what info you need and I'll post it.

My emerge info:

Have you tried re-emerging affected packages (and plugins) since installing
7.0.0_rc3?

Yes I have.

At least acroreader plugin works fine with modular X and firefox 1.5.

It may be that you're missing some required dependencies of the plugins on modular.

I've seen no problems with flash, acroread, mplayerplug-in, so I would concur
with the dependencies comment.

Well, another (perhaps related) problem I have is that XKB(?) is looking for
XKeysymDB and XErrorDB in /usr/lib/X11/ instead of /usr/share/X11.

Temporarily solved by a symlink.

As of dependencies, I have just merged the dependencies that xorg-x11-7.0.0-rc3
ebuild wants and the needed drivers on top of that.

I have a 6.5M log from "strace -f firefox www.oeb.se" and then a click on
"Hembanken kodbox" which tries to use Java.
But I guess you don't want the whole 6.5M log and I really don't know what to
look for.

There's alot of "ETIMEDOUT (Connection timed out)" and "Resource not available"
near the bottom..

When grepping for "No such file or directory" and "X11" I get many access'es for
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/lib/common/xlcDef.so.2..

I don't even have a "lib"-dir in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale (/usr/X11R6 linking
to /usr)

Is this file needed?

mixing stable plugins with a testing version of firefox in the tree is gonna
cause problems. Unless you are willing to use unstable plugins bug is invalid.

According to my portage-tree, mozilla-firefox-1.0.7-r4 is stable.

Well.. apparently java didn't work because I had nxclient-1.4.0 installed and flash didn't work because I had composite extension turned on
