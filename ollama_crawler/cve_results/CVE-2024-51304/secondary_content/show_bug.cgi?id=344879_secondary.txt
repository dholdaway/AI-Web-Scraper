Description

After upgrading to Qt-4.7.0 and kde-4.5.3, I get a new undesired behaviour. My panel is at the bottom of the screen, and configured to auto-hide. When I move thr mouse to the bottom, the panel slides from below. In 4.5.3, in most cases, the panel is 100% transparent: I see its upper boundary, but it just shows the background or windows below the panel. In some cases, the panel is visible as usual. OK, now I'll do an experiment: - means that I cannot see the panel, + that I can.


--+------------+-------+-----------------------+---+------------+-----+
----------------+---+--+--+------+-------+---+-+-----+------------++-++
----------+++---------+----+----------------+-+--+---+++----------+---+

So the experiment shows that the panel works correctly with probability about 15%. When the panel is invisible, it still works: blindly clicking on various places in it produces expected results, small images of windows are displayed when the mouse is above the (invisible!) areas of the panel representing these windows, the tip about the launcher menu is displayed when the mouse is above the (invisible!) K letter, etc. If I switch off autohiding, this invisible panel is always on screen.

The upgrade to kde-4.5.0 brought the bug #340050, and now this. It seems that kde becomes more buggy with each version :-(

Come on, we need a bit more info! X driver? emerge --info?
CC'ing qt since this might be related to 4.7

Yesterday I upgraded Qt to 4.7.1, and re-compiled all kde-4.5.3. After that, this effect disappeared. Closing.
