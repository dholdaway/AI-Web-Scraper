configure: error: Package requirements (xproto >= 7.0.13 x11 >= 1.6 xextproto >= 7.0.3 xext >= 1.0.99.1 inputproto >= 2.2.99.1) were not met:

Package 'xextproto', required by 'virtual:world', not found
Package 'xext', required by 'virtual:world', not found
Package 'inputproto', required by 'virtual:world', not found

Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
installed software in a non-standard prefix.

Alternatively, you may set the environment variables XI_CFLAGS
and XI_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.
See the pkg-config man page for more details.

What's the output of

> emerge x11-libs/libX11 x11-libs/libXext x11-libs/libXfixes x11-base/xorg-proto -vp

Those are the listed dependencies for libXi.

Also,

> emerge virtual/pkgconfig -vp

Have you recently, and perhaps incompletely, transitioned from the 17.0 profile to the 17.1 profile?

If you try to reemerge all of those packages, like this

> emerge x11-libs/libX11 x11-libs/libXext x11-libs/libXfixes x11-base/xorg-proto libXi -v1a

what happens? Does libXi still fail?

Again encountered this one:
https://bugs.gentoo.org/707870

Will try full rebuild of @system and @world sets :(

Like I said:

Don't remember if I switched the profile somewhere explicitly, only GCC was upgraded. as I remember.

Give the directions in

a try. Specifically

> emerge -1v --deep /lib32 /usr/lib32 /usr/lib/llvm/*/lib32
