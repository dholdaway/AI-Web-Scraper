Description

          2022-11-04 22:09:34 UTC
        

This package has been identified via automation as potentially impacted by upcoming Clang 16 changes.
The following have been identified as potential issues:

[-Werror,-Wimplicit-function-declaration]

[-Werror,-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
error: call to undeclared library function 'strlcpy' with type 'unsigned long (char *, const char *, unsigned long)'; ISO C99 and later do not support implicit function declarations [-Werror,-Wimplicit-function-declaration]

Done by check_symbol_exists in cmake. Cannot reproduce. Maybe fixed by cmake upstream?
