​Exhibit 99.1​​Investor Relations:Raul JacobVictor Pedraglio+(602) 264-1375southerncopper@southernperu.com.pewww.southerncoppercorp.com​February 2nd, 2024Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE and BVL: SCCO)​Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE and BVL: SCCO)Even though 2023 was a challenging year for Southern Copper, we achieved good results. The main highlights for the year 2023 were the following:​​​​​​​​●2023 Net sales were $9,895.8 million, this is $152 million or 1.5% lower than 2022 net sales. This result was driven by higher sales volumes for copper (+2.2%) and molybdenum (+2.3%) and better prices for molybdenum (+27.5%) and silver (+7.6%). This situation was partially offset by a decrease in metal prices for copper (LME -3.8%) and zinc (-24.1%) and by a reduction in the sales volume of silver (-4.3%) and zinc (-1.4%).Net sales in 2023 were negatively impacted by a year accounting adjustment of $406.0 million for lower metal prices on sales. In addition to this, we estimate that 2023 sales were affected by a larger copper anode inventory in process at year-end.  If we exclude these two effects, 2023 sales would have been 3.2% higher than the 2022 mark.●Net income was $2,425.2 million, 8.1% lower than in 2022. The net income margin in 2023 was 24.5%, versus 26.3% in 2022.●Adjusted EBITDA in 2023 was $5,029.5 million; this is 6% lower ($319.7 million below) than the figure in 2022. The drop in adjusted EBITDA YoY was primarily attributable to a reduction in sales equivalent to $152 million; a $113 million nonrecurring variance in Other Income due to 2022 insurance and tax refunds; and a $54.1 million uptick in operating costs. The adjusted EBITDA margin in 2023 was 50.8% versus 53.2% in 2022.  ●We spent $1,008.6 million on capital investments, which reflected a 6.3% increase YoY and represented 41.6% of net income in 2023.●Cash flow from operating activities in 2023 was $3,573.1 million, which represented an increase of 27.5% over the $2,802.5 million posted in 2022. This result was mainly driven by a reduction in working capital.●2023 Copper production increased 1.8% YoY to 911,014 tons. The yearly result was mainly attributable to higher production at our Peruvian operations (+9.5%); this result was partially offset by a 2.9% reduction in production at our Mexican operations, which was mainly driven by a drop in ore grades, mineral processing and recovery.In the second half of 2023, we experienced a reduction of fresh water at our Buenavista operation, which was generated by the fact that we lack the permits we expect to receive to build a pipeline (approximately 20 km) to transport water from the wells to the operations and nearby townsites. For 2024, the Company has decided to transport water through other means to secure the supplies required to ensure that Buenavista can operate at full capacity for copper production and the ramp up of new zinc concentrator operations.​The following information was filed by Southern Copper Corp (SCCO) on Friday, February 2, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.
