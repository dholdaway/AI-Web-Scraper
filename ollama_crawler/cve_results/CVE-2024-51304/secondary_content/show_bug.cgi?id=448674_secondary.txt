Description

The proposed solution is in the tracker.
If this is an autotools based package, and '--disable-silent-rules' doesn't work, you can try:
- emake V=1 in src_compile() and/or src_install()
- MAKEOPTS+=" V=1" as global scope

Note: if you will port the ebuild to EAPI 5, it includes '--disable-silent-rules'

Sorry but I really don't understand. I didn't see these type of bugs closed as WORKSFORME. Can you explain?

the right place to fix this is a central place.  i.e. econf.
