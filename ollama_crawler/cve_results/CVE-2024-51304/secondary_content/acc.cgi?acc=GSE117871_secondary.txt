Title
Expression data from control or Hnf6/Oc2 compound mutant mouse embryonic spinal cords

Organism
Mus musculus

Experiment type
Expression profiling by array

Summary
In the embryonic spinal cord, cardinal populations of interneurons (INs) diversify into specialized subsets and migrate to defined locations within the spinal parenchyma.However, the factors that control IN diversification and migration remain almost totally unknown. We demonstrate with  that Onecut proteins regulate the diversification and the migration of V2 INs in the spinal parenchyma.To identify genes downstream of Onecut transcription factors that may contribute to V2 interneuron differentiation and distribution, we performed a microarray comparison of control and of OC-deficient spinal cord transcriptome at e11.5, namely at the stage when significant numbers of V2 cells have been generated and are initiating migration

 


Overall design
5 controls and 5 Hnf6/Oc2 compound mutant mouse embryos
