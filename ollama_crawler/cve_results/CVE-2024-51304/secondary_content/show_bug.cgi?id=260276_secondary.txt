lvm2-2.02.36 installs init-scripts for use with baselayout2, but it also installs addon-start and addon-stop to be used with baselayout1.

Doesn't lvm work with your system?
Sure you cannot use the init-script (which is for baselayout2) to run lvm, but that is not needed.

O.K.
lvm starts without entered it to init-level on baselayout-1 
In using  lvmcreate command  you may use lvm command first
