That happens after upgrade to x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers-180.35 or 180.37 (from devnull overlay). Version 180.29 works fine.

Could be related to bug #260441

The cause is libGL.so.180.37. Replacing it with .29 version resolves the issue. I see now that I must take it to nvidia.

No, it looks like a separate issue. I think it is not related.

Like you said. This bug should maybe taken upstream. For the sake of completeness, I gonna reassign/CC this bug to the correesponding maintainers.

Please run nvidia-bug-report.sh and attach it here and if possible to an upstream forum post. Additionally attach emerge --info and emerge -pv xorg-server and then re-open the bug.

That is the correct emerge --info as previously I forgot that I changed to xorg-x11 profile to start firefox.

I'm closing it as the problem is now gone after I have rebuilt part of the world (first ~400 packages). I'm still wondering not sure what package was causing problems.
