Emerging gscmxx-0.4.1-r1 fails in configure stage (after unpacking).

Error message:
>>> Source unpacked.
Checking for Gtk-Perl............. ok
Checking for Image::Size..........perl: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.5/i686-linux/auto/Image/Magick/Magick.so: undefined symbol: InitializeMagick
make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:




Installed version of gscmxx's dependencies:
app-misc/scmxx: 0.6.4
dev-lang/perl: 5.8.5-r4
dev-perl/gtk-perl: 0.7008-r11
x11-libs/gtk+: gtk+-1.2.10-r11
dev-perl/ImageSize: 2.99-r1
media-gfx/imagemagick: 6.1.8.8

OK, wfm now too.
Strange thing is:
Remerging imagemagick upgraded to 6.2.0.4 (I must have synced in 
between..)
The first merge was during an installation (copied over world file from
another system). So it maybe was a temporary dependency problem.

I guess, we had a dependency problem after a perl-upgrade, but not an application-update.  You should run /usr/portage/dev-lang/perl/files/perl-cleaner after a perl-upgrade in order to recompile depencies on perl-libraries.

I'm closing that bug now.
