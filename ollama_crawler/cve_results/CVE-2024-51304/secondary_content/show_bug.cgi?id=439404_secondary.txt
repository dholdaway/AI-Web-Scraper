Description

After switching to php-5.4 I only see a white page at login to squirrelmail and found this error in the apache logs:
PHP Fatal error:  Call to undefined function session_unregister() in /var/www/...


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge php version 5.4
2. eselect php set apache2 php5.4
3. /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
4. login to squirrelmail



According to http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=664895 and the paragraph "ANNOUNCE: PHP 5.4 Compatibility" on http://squirrelmail.org/index.php this should be fixed in the "Stable version snapshots (1.4.23-svn)" (see http://squirrelmail.org/download.php).

mail-client/squirrelmail-1.4.23_pre20121024 is added to the tree (hard mask for now).  Can you please test and see if it works with php-5.4?  Thank you.

Tested mail-client/squirrelmail-1.4.23_pre20121024 with php-5.4 but the error remains.

I'm having problems with php-5.4 and squirrelmail too although I don't get the blank page that Horst does.  Certain lines of some messages don't appear in squirrelmail but do appear normally in claws-mail.  This started when I upgraded to php-5.4.  I've just upgraded to squirrelmail-1.4.23_pre20121024 and restarted apache2 but the problem persists.

This looks like a separate bug:
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=3525227&group_id=311&atid=100311

Do I understand you correctly that squirrelmail-1.4.23_pre20121024 works for you with php-5.4 otherwise?

Sorry, should have read the error log more carefully or post the complete message here:
PHP Fatal error:  Call to undefined function session_unregister() in /var/www/<hostname>/htdocs-secure/squirrelmail/plugins/login_alias/functions.php on line 64, referer: https://<hostname>/src/login.php

So incompatible with php-5.4 is the login_alias plugin, which I installed by just unpacking the tgz in /var/www/<hostname>/htdocs-secure/squirrelmail/plugins/.

It seems that rest of squirrelmail uses sqsession_unregister() defined in it's own functions/global.php, so I replaced all calls of session_unregister() to sqsession_unregister() in the login_alias plugin (as there is no newer version than my 2.5 on squirrelmail.org) and the error is fixed.

Finally I reverted back to squirrelmail-1.4.22: It also works with php-5.4.

So, can you please revert the version pinning for PHP-5.3 in the ebuild?

Since PHP-5.4 is stable, the pinning forces the installation of PHP-5.3 in an extra slot when installing squirrelmail.
