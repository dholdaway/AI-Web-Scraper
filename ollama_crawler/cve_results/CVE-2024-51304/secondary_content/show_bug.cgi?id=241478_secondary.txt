Description

setting the gcj use flag with gcc v3.4.6 creates files called /usr/bin/{gcj-4.1.2,gcjh-4.1.2}.  Unfortunately, packages such as pdftk look for compiler drivers call gcj and gcjh. 

Reproducible: Always




Here is my workaround.  Do this after installing gcj:
sudo ln /usr/bin/{gcj-4.1.2,gcj}
sudo ln /usr/bin/{gcjh-4.1.2,gcjh}

It sounds like you needed to run 'gcc-config' after compiling your toolchain with gcj enabled; /usr/bin/gcj and /usr/bin/gcjh are supposed to be managed by gcc-config just like /usr/bin/gcc. Try deleting your manual symlinks and use gcc-config to select your new toolchain -- do gcj and gcjh get created?

Please follow Wormo's advice. In any case 3.4.6 should never create gcj-4.1.2 though (as that's a different version)

gcc-config just needed to be called.
