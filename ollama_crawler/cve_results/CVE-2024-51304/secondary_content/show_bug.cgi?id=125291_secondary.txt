xforms-1.0.90 $ grep -r rman .
./lib/flsnprintf.c: * - good performance for large string handling (large format, large
./lib/flsnprintf.c: *   argument or large paddings). Performance is similar to system's sprintf
./lib/flsnprintf.c:   /* but the following code achieves better performance for cases
./configure:  # Don't add to $LIBS permanently.


I can't find:
| rman -f HTML < fd2ps._man \
|   > fd2ps.1x-html && mv -f fd2ps.1x-html fd2ps.1x.html
