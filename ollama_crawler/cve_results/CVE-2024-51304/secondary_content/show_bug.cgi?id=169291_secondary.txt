Just so I can compare, which versions of URI, WWW-Mechanize, and HTTP-Server-Simple are you working with?

Hm, after installing everything in the dev-perl list except those mentioned in #169152, comment 5, the package passes all tests. Go figure. All three  abovementioned packages remained at same versions.

That is baffling - unlike the last case of Mikey mistaking dep'd versions, this one has been pretty clear all along:
requires:
    Carp::Assert::More:            0
    HTTP::Server::Simple:          0.07
    Test::LongString:              0.07
    Test::More:                    0
    URI::file:                     0
    WWW::Mechanize:                1.00

(0 should mean any version will suffice). The particular test that failed is using URI::file and HTTP::Server::Simple (which is what I'm actually suspecting, except for your note that it wasn't upgraded). Bah.

I double-checked, but none of those packages was actually upgraded. Maybe it's caused by some underlying Test-* modules, which have been upgraded in the big batch? (I don't know how these tests work, so I'm just guessing here...)

I thought of that too - but it only employs Test-Simple (Test::More mostly, but that's part of Simple - go figure) and test-longstring. perplexed to say the least (goes without say I still can't get this to dup :/)

Hm, I got this package to pass all tests on my other x86 box. How about we just forget the whole thing and I just mark it stable?

Or is there anything else you want me to try to debug this?

concur (only because i'm out of straws to draw)
