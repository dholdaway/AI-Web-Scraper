OpenRC is looking for a new home!

I no longer have the time or motivation to maintain OpenRC. This is partly because I no longer use Gentoo. If you wish to take over maintenance, email me.

However, since I no longer use Gentoo I will not be maintaining  OpenRC anymore. That will need a new home. A big thanks to all the people who helped me work on it over the years :)

IMHO we should abandon openrc and switch to something more modern and more maintained like upstart (bug #150190) or systemd (bug #318365). Personally I'd prefer the latter.

Frankly, seeing as openrc never got into stable, even
though it went into the tree so long ago, I'm rather
skeptical about the chances of any new idea.

i`m agree with Davide - we should use upstart or systemd

I am getting in touch with Roy to take maintainership so we can continue the development. Please do not panic give us a couple of weeks to work out the bugs so we can get a version to stable and continue development.

Gentoo is the upstream

I recently installed Ubuntu on the PC my wife uses and ofc installed dhcpcd + friends. After dicking around with upstart a little I can say this:
It is highly unsuitable for Gentoo for one simple reason - the inability to turn services on or off. They are basically always on. Don't like it, move the /etc/init/${service}.conf out of the way.

The fact that several people said they would attempt a stable push and then gave up (I was one - lol) says quite a bit really.
