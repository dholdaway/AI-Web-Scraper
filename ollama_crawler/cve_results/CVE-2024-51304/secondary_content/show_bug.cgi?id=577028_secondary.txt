Building with doc use flag fails with

 * python3_4: running distutils-r1_run_phase python_compile_all
make -j1 -C doc 'SPHINXBUILD="${PYTHON}" "${S}/sphinx-build.py"' html
make: Entering directory '/var/tmp/portage/dev-python/sphinx-1.2.2/work/Sphinx-1.2.2/doc'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/var/tmp/portage/dev-python/sphinx-1.2.2/work/Sphinx-1.2.2/sphinx-build.py", line 16, in <module>
    sys.exit(make_main(sys.argv))
  File "/var/tmp/portage/dev-python/sphinx-1.2.2/work/Sphinx-1.2.2/sphinx/__init__.py", line 85, in make_main
    from sphinx import make_mode
  File "/var/tmp/portage/dev-python/sphinx-1.2.2/work/Sphinx-1.2.2/sphinx/make_mode.py", line 72
    print "Error: %r is not a directory!" % self.builddir
                                        ^
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'
Makefile:18: recipe for target 'html' failed
make: *** [html] Error 1
make: Leaving directory '/var/tmp/portage/dev-python/sphinx-1.2.2/work/Sphinx-1.2.2/doc'

after a research I found that the upstream code

https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx
/blob/b4620a38887b1195b26e7b2fa5552bbfd2b9f6b7/sphinx/make_mode.py#L72

at release 1.2.3 and 1.2.2 (I tested only this) can't build doc because the code is not fully migrated to python 3 from python 2

Proposal: patch the missing parenthesis or drop doc use flag

This should be a text book application of https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Python/distutils-r1#DISTUTILS_SINGLE_IMPL

As of today, sphinx builds its doc just fine under both py2 and py3.
