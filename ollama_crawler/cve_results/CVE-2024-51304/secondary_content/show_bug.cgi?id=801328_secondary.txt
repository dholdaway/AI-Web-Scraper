I can't reproduce, perhaps your /usr/src/linux wasn't properly built/configured and it tried to add something that's lacking (but that's not allowed by the sandbox).

Please also attach `emerge --info` output if the issue persists.

All i add to do was chmod 755 -R /usr/src/linux has i have umask 077 on the user insted of umask 077 causing problems when i build the kernel without being the user root.
