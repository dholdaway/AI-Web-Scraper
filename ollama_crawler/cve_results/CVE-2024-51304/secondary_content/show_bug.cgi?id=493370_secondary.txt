ifnet plugin should be controlled with USE netifrc or removed completely, not with USE systemd. Support for /etc/conf.d/net is optional in stable openrc and openrc[-netifrc,-newnet] works fine with NM.

I see the point, but taking care that ifnet plugin is not really being maintained, and has some opened bugs without solution, I would like to see other team members opinions about whether we should add the USE flag or drop it completely :/

+  +files/networkmanager-0.9.10.0-arpingpath.patch,
+  +networkmanager-0.9.10.0-r1.ebuild:
+  Ifnet plugin is now disabled because of it being unattended and unmaintained
+  for a long time, leading to some unfixed bugs and new problems appearing
+  (#443596, #458274, #493370, #498372, #523700). If some day somebody volunteers
+  for fixing/maintaining that plugin and forwarding all that fixes to upstream
+  it could be re-enabled of course. Append configure option regarding systemd
+  unit files install path only when systemd support is enabled to prevent
+  HAVE_SYSTEMD to be true (#524534 by Konstantin Ivanov). Ensure arping is found
+  (#523632 by Kobboi).
