The new version currently segfaults on my setup and I've taken it upstream.

I've seen your mail, and have the same issue here. The problem is upstream answering they dont support syslibs... well I'd really like to build it with syslibs, just for packaging quality, including tens of libs that we already have installed, rebuild them and link statically is insane. I'd prefer getting who's faulty here and fix it.



Another question raises with this bump : it can now be slotted with gtk1 ardour properly... but do we really want that ? Or do we just want to kill gtk1 ardour ?

hmmm while running ardour2 through strace I don't get the segfault...

I'm not giving up syslibs yet, though it I might release a non-syslib ebuild for the short term.

slotting is possible if I recall correct, I think they even sorted out the messages resources upstream.
Though I my take on it is that 1.x (that is, 0.9x) is as much "unstable" as the current ardour2 series, offers less or comparable, and we'll punt them off the tree in a few releases.

in CVS - but I can't get it to work well with SYSLIBS on. I'm disabling SYSLIBS for now.

I'd suggest to mask it then:
- their internal libsndfile has automagics iirc
- it disables flac for flac >= 1.1.3 while the one we ship is fine
- the internal libs they ship *must* be checked for security issues
- that it doesn't work with syslibs is probably a bug in ardour that should be tracked and fixed; or also a bug in the libs we ship that should be reported
- didn't check it bug the other libs might have automagic aswell
- libsndfile has had a security fix recently, the one shipped with ardour 2.1 is not patched

Good idea - I've p.mask'd it.

I've just added 2.2, I've had no issue with syslibs & friends, so I've let it go in ~arch, could anyone confirm this so that we can remove 2.1 & close this bug ?




Comment 8


James L. Hammons





          2008-01-17 03:03:02 UTC
        

Confirmed that 2.2 compiles on x86. However, when you try to run ardour2 it segfaults whether you try create a new session or open an existing one.

Agreed that the 0.9x branches should go--the 2.x series is *much* more stable/usable than the 0.9x branch ever was.

mind attaching a backtrace please ?
and also what could help is what versions you have of ardour's depenencies (just check the ebuild, there are a lot :/) to see what differs from your system to mine

This was after selecting an existing session. I could see a small dialog pop up saying "Starting audio engine..." right before it crashed. Also, it crashes whether I have JACK running or not.

interesting, thanks

seems the deps aren't perfect then, let's try to improve them:
could you please try with gtkmm 2.12.3, libgnomecanvasmm 2.20.0, glibmm 2.14.2 ?
that's what I have here and your segfault seems to appear in those libs

James L. Hammons





          2008-01-20 20:41:57 UTC
        

OK, I upgraded gtkmm and glibmm first, and it still segfaulted. But once I upgraded libgnomecanvasmm it worked! :-D

So yeah, you probably need to tighten up the deps before blessing this one.

Side note: 2.2 is much better than even the 2.0.x series! Feel free to nuke the 0.99.x branches as they are GTK1 apps and buggy as hell.

thanks a lot, I've bumped gnomecanvasmm deps then

yep this is planned, but I prefer making sure ardour 2.2 is fine before nuking it ;)


By the way, does is still fail with only the ~arch libgnomecanvasmm and stable glibmm & gtkmm ? From your comment I'd say it doesn't, but I'm not 100% sure.

James L. Hammons





          2008-01-22 15:12:28 UTC
        

I'm not exactly sure what you mean, but currently my glibmm is ver. 2.14.2 (stable) and gtkmm is 2.12.3 (~arch).

thanks, I've updated the deps for ardour 2.3.1 to match these ones, let's hope this is fixed now and please reopen if you're still having issues

          2008-02-19 11:05:47 UTC
        

ardour 2.2 and 2.3.1 both segfault on my machine using:

gtkmm 2.12.3 or 2.12.4
libgnomecanvasmm 2.20.0
glibmm 2.14.2

currently emerging ardour 2.0.5 to see if the problem still exists there...  should this bug perhaps be reopened?

if you need a backtrace or anything else, let me know.

Same situation here. 2.0.5 works great, instead.

          2008-02-28 18:28:25 UTC
        

Interesting info from bug #210552 that I'm pasting here for reference:

I'm using:
media-sound/ardour-2.3.1
dev-cpp/libgnomecanvasmm-2.20.0
dev-cpp/glibmm-2.14.2
dev-cpp/gtkmm-2.12.4

And I get exactly the same crash as of comments #8 #9 #10 of bug #194437.
