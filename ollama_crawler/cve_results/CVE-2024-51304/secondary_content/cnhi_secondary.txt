Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,515 million and Industrial Free Cash Flow was $1,630 million in Q4 2023.Full year 2023 consolidated revenues were $24.7 billion, up 5% year-over-year, with Net sales of Industrial Activities at $22.1 billion, up almost 3%.

With more challenging end markets in Q4, robust contributions from our cost reduction focus and disciplined commercial execution drove margin expansion, and we will remain aggressive on these fronts moving forward. I have tremendous confidence in this CNH team’s ability, regardless of market conditions, to create a bright future for our company, our customers, and our dealers.”Scott W.
