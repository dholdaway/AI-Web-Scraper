www-servers/lighttpd-1.4.11 wrong owner for logfile-dir

after a fresh-install it says
<snip>
(mod_accesslog.c.514) opening access-log failed: Permission denied /var/log/lighttpd/access.log 
</snip>

chown -R lighttpd:lighttpd /var/log/lighttpd/ solves the issue

It looks like the ebuild already sets the owner of the directory:
[snippet from lighttpd-1.4.11.ebuild]:
        keepdir /var/l{ib,og}/lighttpd /var/www/localhost/htdocs
        fowners lighttpd:lighttpd /var/l{ib,og}/lighttpd
        fperms 0750 /var/l{ib,og}/lighttpd
[/snippet]

It does indeed, and I do not see this problem with a fresh install, or on an upgrade.
