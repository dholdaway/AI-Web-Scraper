Gentoo should have a way to override dependencies.

Currently kde-meta depends on kopete. kopete has problems on my system. I want to emerge kde as easily as possible, but I don't really care about kopete. It would be great if Gentoo had a mechanism to specify some custom dependencies for a package that would override what's in the ebuild so I could emerge kde-meta without having to fix kopete.

We have overlays, we have package.provided, we have --nodeps and finally noone forces you to use the KDE metabuild.
