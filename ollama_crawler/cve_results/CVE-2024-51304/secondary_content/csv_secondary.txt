Carriage Services Announces Fourth Quarter and
Full Year 2023 Results
Conference call on Thursday, February 22, 2024
at 9:30 a.m. central time.
 
HOUSTON - February 21, 2024 - (GLOBE NEWSWIRE)
Carriage Services, Inc. (NYSE: CSV) today announced results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023.
 
Company Highlights:
 

●Exceeded full year 2023 guidance ranges for total revenue, adjusted consolidated
EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share, driven by strong fourth quarter performance;
 

●5.2% growth in total revenue over the prior year quarter and 3.3% growth over the prior full year;
 

●Preneed sales deliver 16.1% growth in cemetery operating revenue over the prior year quarter and 13.5%
growth over the prior full year;
 

●41.6% increase in GAAP net income and 41.5% increase in diluted earnings per share over the prior year
quarter;
 

●Founder and Executive Chairman, Mel Payne, to transition to special advisor to the Board of Directors;
 

●The Board of Directors concludes the previously announced review of strategic alternatives; and
 

●Management announces 2024 outlook.
 
Carlos Quezada, Vice Chairman and CEO,
stated, “We are pleased to announce our strong fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. Total revenue grew by 5.2% in the
fourth quarter and 3.3% for the full year, despite the COVID “pull forward” impact resulting in modest declines in
funeral contract volume experienced during the year. This success in growing our top line stems from our targeted efforts to better
leverage our pricing power, which drove improved average revenue per contract, in addition to our preneed cemetery sales
team’s exceptional performance, which resulted in a surge in preneed cemetery sales production of 25.0% for the fourth quarter
and 19.6% for the full year. This increase in revenue, coupled with disciplined cost management, resulted in a year-over-year
increase in adjusted consolidated EBITDA of 3.5%, and a significant 13.2% growth over the prior year quarter, which also included
margin expansion of 230 basis points. This momentum, marking four out of five consecutive quarters of solid performance, instills
confidence and excitement in our core initiatives as we advance into 2024 and focus on fulfilling our new purpose statement, which
is ‘Creating premier experiences through innovation, empowered partnership, and elevated service.’ For those interested
in learning more, we invite you to explore our newly launched website and discover our refreshed Carriage image, which aligns with
our vision of the Carriage of the future,” concluded Mr. Quezada.

●Revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2023 increased
$4.9 million compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily as a result of a 23.6% increase in the number of preneed
interment rights (property) sold, a 1.2% increase in the average price per interment right sold and a 0.7% increase in the average revenue
per funeral contract, offset by a 3.3% decrease in the funeral contract volume.

 

●Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $12.3
million compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily as a result of a 9.4% increase in the average price per preneed interment
right sold, an 8.6% increase in the number of preneed interment rights (property) sold and a 0.9% increase in the average revenue per
funeral contract, offset by a 2.4% decrease in the funeral contract volume.

 

●Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2023 increased
$3.4 million compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to a $3.2 million increase in profit contribution from
our businesses and a $2.9 million decrease in loss on divestitures, disposals and impairment charges, offset by a $1.4 million increase
in interest expense and a $1.1 million increase in general, administrative and other expenses.

 

●Net income for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased
$8.0 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, as the $5.1 million increase in profit contribution from our businesses was
offset by a $10.4 million increase in interest expense and a $4.7 million increase in general, administrative and other expenses.

 
MEL PAYNE TRANSITIONS TO ADVISORY ROLE
 
After 32 years of founding and building Carriage,
Mel Payne, has chosen to step down from his role as Executive Chairman of the Board and transition to a new role as special advisor to
the Board of Directors, which will allow him to be available and share his wealth of knowledge and insights with the Board of Directors
and the senior leadership team. Mel will continue as a member of the Board until his current term expires at the May 2024 annual meeting
of stockholders.
 
Mel, who served as Carriage’s only CEO and
Chairman of the Board for the Company’s first 32 years, started with a vision in 1991 that was born out of a very personal and impactful
experience he had following the loss of a loved one. He turned that experience and vision into a team of more than 2,700 employees and
200 businesses, all driven by a collective mission of serving families during the most challenging time of their lives.
 
“Next to my family, Carriage has been and
continues to be, the greatest love of my life. The friendships I have made over the years are priceless, and watching the growth and development
of so many wonderful leaders throughout the organization has been a true highlight of my career. I have complete confidence in Carlos’
vision and ability to lead Carriage into its next chapter of growth, and, as still a large shareholder, I will be cheering on the team
and offering support,” stated Mr. Payne.
 
“Mel has built a special company and is
one of the true pioneers in this profession. He has handpicked an incredibly talented senior leadership team, and the Board is excited
for the future of Carriage and our stockholders,” stated Lead Independent Director, Don Patteson.
 
CONCLUSION OF REVIEW OF STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES

 
The Board of Directors (the “Board”)
has concluded the Company’s strategic review process, first announced on June 29, 2023, which was overseen by the Board with assistance
from experienced financial and legal advisors. The Board has unanimously determined that continuing to execute on the Company’s
strategic plan as an independent public company is in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders at this time. In this regard,
the Board’s determination took into account positive trends described above in the Company’s financial and operating results
toward the end of 2023. The Board remains committed to maximizing stockholder value.
 
While the Company received a number of proposals
for transactions involving the Company in the course of the strategic review process, following a thorough review and evaluation of the
proposals and alternatives available to the Company, the Board concluded that none of those proposals would be in the best interest of
the Company’s stockholders. The Board endorsed the Company’s continued execution of its standalone business plans as an independent,
publicly held company under the leadership of Carlos Quezada as CEO, Steve Metzger as President and Kian Granmayeh as CFO, as well as
leadership from the Company’s Board, which added three talented new directors during the summer of 2023.

OUTLOOK FOR 2024
 
The Company’s 2024 outlook incorporates
previously stated organic growth initiatives around preneed sales, both in the cemetery and funeral businesses, and expected cost discipline
while the Company continues to deleverage the balance sheet. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2024, the Company expects to close
two transactions to divest certain non-core businesses, reducing 2024 revenue and field EBITDA by ~$5.5 million and $1.5 million, respectively
– the 2024 Outlook reflects the expected impact of these two divestitures.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
 
This earnings release uses Non-GAAP financial
measures to present the financial performance of the Company. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as
an alternative for, the Company’s reported operating results or cash flow from operations or any other measure of performance as
determined in accordance with GAAP. We believe the Non-GAAP results are useful to investors to compare our results to previous periods,
to provide insight into the underlying long-term performance trends in our business and to provide the opportunity to differentiate ourselves
as the best consolidation platform in the industry against the performance of other funeral and cemetery companies.
 
Reconciliations of the Non-GAAP financial measures
to GAAP measures are also provided in this earnings release.
 
The Non-GAAP financial measures used in this earnings
release and the definitions of them used by the Company for our internal management purposes in this earnings release are described below.
 

●Special items are defined as charges or credits included in our GAAP financial statements that can vary
from period to period and are not reflective of costs incurred in the ordinary course of our operations. The change in uncertain tax reserves
was not tax effected. Special items were taxed at the operating tax rate.
 

●Adjusted net income is defined as net income after adjustments for special items that we believe do not
directly reflect our core operations and may not be indicative of our normal business operations. Adjusted net income margin is defined
as adjusted net income as a percentage of total revenue.
 

●Consolidated EBITDA is defined as operating income, plus depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash
stock compensation and net loss on divestitures, disposals and impairment charges. Consolidated EBITDA margin is defined as consolidated
EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue.
 

●Adjusted consolidated EBITDA is defined as consolidated EBITDA after adjustments for acquisition expenses,
severance and separation costs, litigation reserves, disaster recovery and pandemic costs and other special items. Adjusted consolidated
EBITDA margin is defined as adjusted consolidated EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue.
 

●Adjusted free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities, adjusted by special items
as deemed necessary, less cash for maintenance capital expenditures, which include facility repairs and improvements, equipment, furniture
and vehicle purchases and information technology infrastructure improvements. Adjusted free cash flow margin is defined as adjusted free
cash flow as a percentage of total revenue.
 

●Funeral operating EBITDA is defined as funeral gross profit, plus depreciation and amortization and regional
and unallocated costs, less financial EBITDA, ancillary EBITDA and divested EBITDA related to the Funeral Home segment. Funeral operating
EBITDA margin is defined as funeral operating EBITDA as a percentage of funeral operating revenue.
 

●Cemetery operating EBITDA is defined as cemetery gross profit, plus depreciation and amortization and
regional and unallocated costs, less financial EBITDA and divested EBITDA related to the Cemetery segment. Cemetery operating EBITDA margin
is defined as cemetery operating EBITDA as a percentage of cemetery operating revenue.
 

●Preneed cemetery sales production is defined as cemetery property, merchandise and services sold prior
to death.
 

●Financial EBITDA is defined as financial revenue, less the related expenses. Financial revenue and the
related expenses are presented within Other revenue and Other expenses, respectively, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Financial EBITDA margin is defined as financial EBITDA as a percentage of financial revenue.
 

●Ancillary revenue is defined as revenues from our ancillary businesses, which include a flower shop, a
monument company, a pet cremation business and our online cremation businesses. Ancillary revenue and the related expenses are presented
within Other revenue and Other expenses, respectively, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
 

●Ancillary EBITDA is defined as ancillary revenue, less expenses related to our ancillary businesses noted
above. Ancillary EBITDA margin is defined as ancillary EBITDA as a percentage of ancillary revenue.
 


8
 

 

●Divested revenue is defined as revenues from certain funeral home and cemetery businesses that we have
divested.
 

●Divested EBITDA is defined as divested revenue, less field level and financial expenses related to the
divested businesses noted above. Divested EBITDA margin is defined as divested EBITDA as a percentage of divested revenue.
 

●Overhead expenses are defined as regional and unallocated funeral and cemetery costs and general,
administrative and other costs, excluding home office depreciation and non-cash stock compensation.
 

●Adjusted basic earnings per share (EPS) is defined as GAAP basic earnings per share, adjusted for special
items.
 

●Adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) is defined as GAAP diluted earnings per share, adjusted for
special items.
 
Funeral Operating EBITDA and Cemetery Operating EBITDA 
 
Our operations are reported in two business segments:
Funeral Home operations and Cemetery operations. Our operating level results highlight trends in volumes, revenue, operating EBITDA (the
individual business’ cash earning power/locally controllable business profit) and operating EBITDA margin (the individual business’
controllable profit margin).
 
Funeral operating EBITDA and cemetery operating
EBITDA are defined above. Funeral and cemetery gross profit is defined as revenue less “field costs and expenses” —
a line item encompassing these areas of costs: i) funeral and cemetery field costs, ii) field depreciation and amortization expense, and
iii) regional and unallocated funeral and cemetery costs. Funeral and cemetery field costs include cost of service, funeral and cemetery
merchandise costs, operating expenses, labor and other related expenses incurred at the business level.
 
Regional and unallocated funeral and cemetery
costs presented in our GAAP statement consist primarily of salaries and benefits of our regional leadership, incentive compensation opportunity
to our field employees and other related costs for field infrastructure. These costs, while necessary to operate our businesses as currently
operated within our unique, decentralized platform, are not controllable operating expenses at the field level as the composition, structure
and function of these costs are determined by executive leadership in the Houston Support Center. These costs are components of our overall
overhead platform presented within consolidated EBITDA and adjusted consolidated EBITDA. We do not directly or indirectly “push
down” any of these expenses to the individual business’ field level margins.
 
We believe that our “regional and unallocated
funeral and cemetery costs” are necessary to support our decentralized, high performance culture operating framework, and as such,
are included in consolidated EBITDA and adjusted consolidated EBITDA, which more accurately reflects the cash earning power of the Company
as an operating and consolidation platform.
 
Usefulness and Limitations of These Measures
 
When used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures,
our total EBITDA, consolidated EBITDA and adjusted consolidated EBITDA are supplemental measures of operating performance that we believe
are useful measures to facilitate comparisons to our historical consolidated and business level performance and operating results.
 
We believe our presentation of adjusted consolidated
EBITDA, a key metric used internally by our management, provides investors with a supplemental view of our operating performance that
facilitates analysis and comparisons of our ongoing business operations because it excludes items that may not be indicative of our ongoing
operating performance.
 
Our total field EBITDA, consolidated EBITDA and
adjusted consolidated EBITDA are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods
of calculation. Our presentation is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information
prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Funeral operating EBITDA, cemetery operating EBITDA, financial EBITDA, ancillary EBITDA
and divested EBITDA are not consolidated measures of profitability.
 


9
 

 
Our total field EBITDA excludes certain costs
presented in our GAAP statement that we do not allocate to the individual business’ field level margins, as noted above. Consolidated
EBITDA excludes certain items that we believe do not directly reflect our core operations and may not be indicative of our normal business
operations. A reconciliation to operating income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is set forth below.
 
Therefore, these measures may not provide a complete
understanding of our performance and should be reviewed in conjunction with our GAAP financial measures. We strongly encourage investors
to review the Company’s consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not rely on any single
financial measure.
 
RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL
MEASURES
 
The Non-GAAP financial measures are presented
for additional information and are reconciled to their most comparable GAAP measures, all of which are reflected in the tables below.

(1)
During the year ended December 31, 2023, we withdrew $8.6 million of realized capital gains and earnings from our preneed funeral and cemetery trust investments. In certain states, we are allowed to withdraw these funds prior to the delivery of preneed merchandise and service contracts. While the realized capital gains and earnings are not recognized as revenue, they increase our cash flow from operations.

(2)
During the year ended December 31, 2023, we received a $6.0 million incentive payment from a vendor for entering into a strategic partnership agreement to market and sell prearranged funeral services in the future. While we only recognized $0.2 million of the incentive payment as Other revenue during the year ended December 31, 2023, this payment increased our cash flow from operations.

Other special items represents expenses related to our strategic review process.

of 1934, as amended, and contains certain statements and information that may constitute forward-looking statements within the safe harbor
provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements made herein or elsewhere by us, or on our behalf, other
than statements of historical information, should be deemed to be forward-looking statements, which include, but are not limited to, statements
regarding any expectations and projections of earnings, revenue, cash flow, investment returns, capital allocation, debt levels, equity
performance, death rates, market share growth, cost inflation, overhead, preneed sales or other financial items; any statements of the
plans, strategies, objectives, and expectations of management for future operations or financing activities, including, but not limited
to, capital allocation, organizational performance, execution of our strategic initiatives and growth plan, planned divestitures, anticipated
integration, performance and other benefits of recently completed acquisitions, and cost management and debt reductions; any statements
regarding the expectations and successful management of executive transitions; any projections or expectations related to the conclusion
of the Board’s strategic review; any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance; any statements of belief; and
any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing and are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future
developments and their potential effect on us. Words such as “may”, “will”, “estimate”, “intend”,
“believe”, “expect”, “seek”, “project”, “forecast”, “foresee”,
“should”, “would”, “could”, “plan”, “anticipate” and other similar words may
be used to identify forward-looking statements; however, the absence of these words does not mean that the statements are not forward-looking.
While we believe these assumptions concerning future events are reasonable as and when made, there can be no assurance that future developments
affecting us will be those that we anticipate. All comments concerning our expectations for future revenue and operating results are based
on our forecasts for our existing operations and do not include the potential impact of any future acquisitions, except where specifically
noted. Our forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) and assumptions
that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and our present expectations or projections. Important
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include but are not limited
to: our ability to find and retain skilled personnel; the effects of our talent recruitment efforts, incentive and compensation plans
and programs, including such effects on our Standards Operating Model and the Company’s operational and financial performance; our
ability to execute our strategic initiatives and growth plan, if at all; the potential adverse effects on the Company’s business,
financial and equity performance if management fails to meet the expectations of its strategic initiatives and growth plan; our ability
to execute and meet the objectives of our High Performance and Credit Profile Restoration Plan, if at all; the execution of our Standards
Operating, 4E Leadership and Strategic Acquisition Models; the effects of competition; changes in the number of deaths in our markets,
which are not predictable from market to market or over the short term; changes in consumer preferences and our ability to adapt to or
meet those changes; our ability to generate preneed sales, including implementing our cemetery portfolio sales strategy, product development
and optimization plans; the investment performance of our funeral and cemetery trust funds; fluctuations in interest rates, including,
but not limited to, the effects of increased borrowing costs under our Credit Facility and our ability to minimize such costs, if at all;
the effects of inflation on our operational and financial performance, including the increased overall costs for our goods and services,
the impact on customer preferences as a result of changes in discretionary income, and our ability, if at all, to mitigate such effects;
our ability to obtain debt or equity financing on satisfactory terms to fund additional acquisitions, expansion projects, working capital
requirements and the repayment or refinancing of indebtedness; our ability to meet the timing, objectives and expectations related to
our capital allocation framework, including our forecasted rates of return, planned uses of free cash flow and future capital allocation,
including share repurchases, potential strategic acquisitions, internal growth projects, dividend increases, or debt repayment plans;
our ability to meet the projected financial and equity performance goals to our full year outlook, if at all; the timely and full payment
of death benefits related to preneed funeral contracts funded through life insurance contracts; the financial condition of third-party
insurance companies that fund our preneed funeral contracts; increased or unanticipated costs, such as merchandise, goods, insurance or
taxes, and our ability to mitigate or minimize such costs, if at all; our level of indebtedness and the cash required to service our indebtedness;
changes in federal income tax laws and regulations and the implementation and interpretation of these laws and regulations by the Internal
Revenue Service; effects of the application of other applicable laws and regulations, including changes in such regulations or the interpretation
thereof; the potential impact of epidemics and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 coronavirus, including any new or emerging public health
threats, on customer preferences and on our business; government, social, business and other actions that have been and will be taken
in response to pandemics, such as the COVID-19 coronavirus, including potential responses to any new or emerging public health threats;
effects and expense of litigation; consolidation in the funeral and cemetery industry; our ability to identify and consummate strategic
acquisitions, if at all, and successfully integrate acquired businesses with our existing businesses, including expected performance and
financial improvements related thereto; potential adverse impacts resulting from the announcement of the conclusion of the Board’s
strategic review; economic, financial and stock market fluctuations; interruptions or security lapses of our information technology, including
any cybersecurity or ransomware incidents; adverse developments affecting the financial services industry; acts of war or terrorists acts
and the governmental or military response to such acts; our failure to maintain effective control over financial reporting; and other
factors and uncertainties inherent in the funeral and cemetery industry.

factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our projected results, please see “Risk Factors” in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and in other filings with the SEC, available at www.carriageservices.com. Investors

 Inside Carriage Services Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
These policies are considered critical because they may result in fluctuations in our reported results from period to period due to the significant judgments, estimates and assumptions about complex and inherently uncertain matters and because the use of different judgments, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.



 M & A - Other   Highlight
In addition, the Credit Facility also contains customary negative covenants, including, but not limited to, covenants that restrict (subject to certain exceptions) the ability of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make investments, engage in mergers and acquisitions, and pay dividends and other restricted payments, and certain financial maintenance covenants.

 Financial - Shares   Highlight
The Indenture contains restrictive covenants limiting our ability and our Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares, create liens on certain assets to secure debt, pay dividends or make other equity distributions, purchase or redeem capital stock, make certain investments, sell assets, agree to certain restrictions on the ability of Restricted Subsidiaries to make payments to us, consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all assets, or engage in transactions with affiliates.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
During 2023, we continued to experience cost increases from our vendors and suppliers on merchandise and goods due to increases in the cost of raw materials, as well as inflationary impacts and rising interest rates.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Such inflation may negatively impact consumer discretionary spending, including the amount that consumers are able to spend on our services, although we have not experienced any material impacts to date and our industry has been largely resilient to similar adverse economic and market environments in the past.
