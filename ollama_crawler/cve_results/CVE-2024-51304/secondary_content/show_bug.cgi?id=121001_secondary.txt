The default partition setup is to use a /boot partition, but the default grub-install command line does not include (or mention) the --root-directory=/boot command line switch.  The result is an error at boot stating 'invalid device string' without an actual grub error number.

This is the case in the installation guide, x86 install handbook, amd64 install handbook and the installation docs on the 2005.1 universal install cd.

It only took a few minutes to locate the problem, and a manual grub install would not be affected but this probably throws newbies a real curve.

Correct, the manual install doesn't show any problems. Actually, neither that nor the other way have given me any problems, even on systems without a /boot partition (i.e. /boot is on the same partition as /).

+1. Tried both with and without a /boot partition.
