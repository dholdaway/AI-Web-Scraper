BRST (Brazilian Summer Time) begins at 00:00 AM in october 19th, but with the stable version of timezone-data the clock has already been advanced.
Installing the masked version (2008g) has set back the clock to the correct time.
Could you turn this package stable? 

Thanks!

Reproducible: Always

This package hasn't been in the tree long enough to meet the normal stabilization requirements, so the package maintainers may wait a little while before acting on this stabilization request.

According to #240283, this release's main intent is to fix the Brazilian DST rules (which were changed with very short notice by the president). Does this mean that the fix will only go stable in a few weeks, when it (or a big part of it) will be no longer needed?

And upstream (ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/) already released tzdata2008h.tar.gz and tzcode2008h.tar.gz .

The bug can now be closed, as the old timezone data is now compatible with the Brazilian summer time for the rest of this year. This was one of the few cases in which timing was crucial to correct a bug.
