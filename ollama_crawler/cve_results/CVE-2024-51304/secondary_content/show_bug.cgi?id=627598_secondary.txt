On 2017-07-18 a mail inquiring project status was sent to project alias. I do not have any reply registered for this project.

If you have not received the mail, please contact me. If I missed your reply, then I'm sorry, please just let me know. Otherwise, please look into replying to that mail. The reply is important to determine the project status and the steps to follow.

I didn't get any e-mail either, simply because I don't have bug-wranglers@ send me e-mail. It's much more useful to ask bugzilla for a list of bugs assigned to bug-wranglers that haven't been touched in a few days and sort those from oldest to newest. Currently, that's 46 bugs including this one.

As far as I am concerned, the project works fine as long as people maintain the project page and actually wrangle bug reports.
