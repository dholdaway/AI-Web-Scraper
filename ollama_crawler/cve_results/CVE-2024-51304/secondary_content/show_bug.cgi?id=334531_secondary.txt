Description

          2010-08-26 08:52:12 UTC
        

When sys-fs/udisks is emerged either as part of emerging gnome or singly, it fails to complete. Here are the last few lines of the output:
...
Making all in man
make[3]: Entering directory `/var/tmp/portage/sys-fs/udisks-1.0.1-r1/work/udisks-1.0.1/doc/man'
/usr/bin/xsltproc -nonet http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/manpages/docbook.xsl udisks.xml
I/O error : Attempt to load network entity http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/manpages/docbook.xsl
warning: failed to load external entity "http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/manpages/docbook.xsl"
cannot parse http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/manpages/docbook.xsl

(This is not the same bug as 330993)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge sys-fs/udisks
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
The above error occurs

Expected Results:  
A correct completion of the command

My configuration:
Linux aim-hydra 2.6.34-gentoo-r1 #2 SMP PREEMPT Tue Aug 24 18:51:34 CEST 2010 i686 Intel(R) Core(TM) i5 CPU 750 @ 2.67GHz GenuineIntel GNU/Linux

Note: 
When i add "doc" to my USE variables in make.conf, it is still not possible to emerge udisks, but the error is different:
...

I semi-recently reported a very similiar bug on another package, gnome-deskbar or something.

Check for a missing dtd.

works fine here, something wrong with your

app-text/docbook-xsl-stylesheets
app-text/docbook-xml-dtd:4.1.2

installations... nothing udisks ebuild can fix.

it'll work fine as long as you have internet access or no glitch with it during ebuild. The build seems to require xml-dtd 4.3 and/or xsl stylesheets.

I'd propose in that case that those dtds and/or stylesheets are properly listed as dependencies if they aren't.

I think it's bogus to require internet access once everything's been fetched properly.

You mean bug #330255.

I just ran into the same problem compiling polkit-0.96-r1 and yes the xml and xsl stylesheets are installed. If I can't get past this one by reinstalling the docbook xml/xsl stuff, I'll file a separate bug report.

I solved the problem by reinstalling =app-text/docbook-xml-dtd-4.3-r1, this for anyone else who might run into the same problem that I did. Peace out! :)

please attach /etc/xml/catalog and /etc/xml/docbook files.
The dtds are already in DEPEND of the ebuild, so unless this is a recent addition (not as far as the log says) the build should have succeeded. However there is a long history of problems with tools manipulating xml/dtds catalogs.




Comment 12


Samuli Suominen (RETIRED)






          2010-12-02 15:39:48 UTC
        

ebuild has proper deps, the DTD in use is 4.1.2
