 Inside Harley Davidson Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Expense   Highlight
However, it is possible that a field action or recall could be required that could cause the Company to incur material costs.



 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Rising interest rates have adversely impacted HDFS' interest income margin as HDFS could only partially offset the higher cost of funds with increased interest rates on products it offered to its customers.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
(1) The HDFS segment results could be negatively affected by higher costs of funding and increased difficulty of raising, or potential unsuccessful efforts to raise, funding in the short-term and long-term capital markets.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Further, the Company believes that HDFS's retail credit losses will continue to change over time due to changing consumer credit behavior, macroeconomic conditions including the impact of inflation and HDFS's efforts to increase prudently structured loan approvals to sub-prime borrowers.

 Other - Other   Highlight
In addition, HDFS’s efforts to adjust underwriting criteria based on market and economic conditions and the actions that the Company has taken and could take that impact motorcycle values may impact HDFS's retail credit losses.
