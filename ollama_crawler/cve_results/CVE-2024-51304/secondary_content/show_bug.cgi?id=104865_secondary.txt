Currently the ebuild assumes that --with-opengl means --without-x, but there are
some X libraries that snes9x needs to use even if it's configured for opengl. 
So it needs to be --with-opengl --without-glide --with-x, or the binary fails to
find the GLU library in its proper location /usr/X11R6/lib.

Disregard my comment if you already have moved libGLU into the /usr/lib directory.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge snes9x

Actual Results:  
blah blah can't find -lGLU.  I lost the actual results on scrollback.

Expected Results:  
It compiles and installs.

My X install is kind of less than Gentooey, so this might not be a bug at all,
but a "feature" in properly set up distros.

Works fine for me.  reopen with more information, starting with the output of
emerge --info.
