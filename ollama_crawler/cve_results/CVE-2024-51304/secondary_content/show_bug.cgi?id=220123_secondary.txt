python2.5 crashes on the dev-python/formencode-1.01 ebuild.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install python 2.5
2. ln -s /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/python2.5
3. emerge formencode

Actual Results:  
 *
 * ERROR: dev-python/formencode-1.0.1 failed.
 * Call stack:
 *               ebuild.sh, line   49:  Called src_compile
 *             environment, line 2315:  Called distutils_src_compile
 *             environment, line  679:  Called die
 * The specific snippet of code:
 *       ${python} setup.py build "$@" || die "compilation failed"
 *  The die message:
 *   compilation failed


Expected Results:  
A successful emerge.

Relinking /usr/bin/python to python 2.4 allows the ebuild to complete successfully.

Without the actual error message, your bug report won't lead anywhere. You did run python-updater after updating Python, as the post install message asked you to do!?

I did run python-upgrader after upgrading to python2.5, in fact.  It tried to merge formencode and failed, which crashed python-updater.

The error messsage I received was reproduced in the bug report.  If you like, I'll reproduce a little more of the error message below.

What does `qlist setuptools` setuptools print?

Can you reemerge setuptools and try again? It works fine here. Please reopen if
it still doesn't work.
