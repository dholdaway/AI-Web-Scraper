I can not compile stable dev-python/lxml-2.2.2 with latest stable dev-python/setuptools-0.6.4. The compilation resulting in the following error:

>>> Compiling source in /var/tmp/portage/dev-python/lxml-2.2.2/work/lxml-2.2.2 ...
 * Building of dev-python/lxml-2.2.2 with Python 2.6...                           
python2.6 setup.py build -b build-2.6                                             
Traceback (most recent call last):                                                
  File "setup.py", line 14, in <module>                                           
    pkg_resources.require("setuptools>=0.6c5")                                    
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/pkg_resources.py", line 621, in require  
    needed = self.resolve(parse_requirements(requirements))                       
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/pkg_resources.py", line 519, in resolve  
    raise DistributionNotFound(req)  # XXX put more info here                     
pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: setuptools>=0.6c5

When I unmask dev-python/setuptools-0.6.6, everything works without any problems.

Stabilization of dev-python/setuptools-0.6.6 has been already requested in bug #291915.
