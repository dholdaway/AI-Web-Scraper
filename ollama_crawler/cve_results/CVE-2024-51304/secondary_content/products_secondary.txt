Product Identification

				A fundamental part of the CVE analysis process is to uniquely identify the 
				vulnerable products affected by any given vulnerability. This effort allows 
				consumers of our data to check for known issues for any product they may 
				currently have in their environment (as long as they know the associated 
				product identifier).
			

				The NVD currently uses the CPE 2.3 specifications to accomplish this goal. 
				CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, 
				software, and packages. Based upon the generic syntax for Uniform Resource 
				Identifiers (URI), CPE includes a formal name format, a method for checking 
				names against a system, and a description format for binding text and tests 
				to a name. For more information regarding CPE and its uses, please refer to 
				the NVD CPE products page. NVD analysts 
				assign applicability statements consisting of CPE match strings to CVEs 
				during the analysis process. These match strings are intended to correlate 
				with CPEs present in the official CPE Dictionary. In the event a CPE does 
				not exist in the CPE Dictionary, NVD staff will submit a request to 
				have them added.
			

				The NVD is always looking to improve on the methodologies it uses. As such 
				SWID is being looked into as a possible replacement for CPE. SWID (Software 
				Identification) Tags are a software product identification specification. 
				SWID tags support automation of software inventory as part of a software 
				asset management (SAM) process, assessment of software vulnerabilities present 
				on a computing device, detection of missing patches, targeting of configuration 
				checklist assessments, software integrity checking, installation and execution 
				allowlists/denylists, and other security and operational use cases. For more 
				information on SWID please refer to the 
				SWID information page.
