When using texconfig to enable hyphenation for slovene, you have for option 
the following line in .../config/language.dat:   
%slovene sihyph22.tex   
but the file suplied with app-text/tetex-3.0-r2 is sihyph23.tex, therefore the   
correct line should be    
slovene sihyph23.tex   

Reproducible: Always

Do you mean tetex-3.0_p1-r2? tetex-3.0-r2 isn't in the tree.

If that is the case, then I can't reproduce the problem. My texconfig lists sihyph23.tex in all cases.
What exactly did you choose in texconfig?

The bug was present in tetex-3.0-r2, but seems to be solved now (in app-text/tetex-3.0_p1-r2).

Ahh... sorry, I didn't realize that I was dealing with an old bug.
Glad it is fixed!
