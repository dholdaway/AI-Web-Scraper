Description

Ebuild for bind-9.2.5 doesn't include the "named.conf" file that should reside
in /etc/bind/named.conf

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Intall ebuild
2. run /etc/init.d/named start
Actual Results:  
 * Starting named ...
 * No /etc/bind/named.conf file exists!
grep: /etc/bind/named.conf: No such file or directory                          
        [ !! ]

Expected Results:  
a stock standard named.conf should be included for a simple cache dns server.

$ equery f bind | grep named.conf
/etc/bind/named.conf
/usr/share/doc/bind-9.2.5-r6/dhcp-dynamic-dns-examples/bind/etc/named.conf
/usr/share/man/man5/named.conf.5.gz

$ equery b /etc/bind/named.conf
[ Searching for file(s) /etc/bind/named.conf in *... ]
net-dns/bind-9.2.5-r6 (/etc/bind/named.conf)

Re-emerge bind if you are missing this file.
