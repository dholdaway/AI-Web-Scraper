Doesn't get installed by the hotplug ebuild and isn't by any other package.

# grep updfstab /etc/hotplug/usb.agent
    if [ -x /usr/sbin/updfstab ]; then
        /usr/sbin/updfstab

# equery b /etc/hotplug/usb.agent
[ Searching for file(s) /etc/hotplug/usb.agent in *... ]
sys-apps/hotplug-20040923-r2 (/etc/hotplug/usb.agent)

Don't see the issue here, if it doesn't exist, then it's skipped and that's all.
