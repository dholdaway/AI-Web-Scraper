This is an auto-filed bug because media-libs/harfbuzz fails tests.
The issue was originally discovered on arm, but it may be reproducible on other arches as well.
If you think that a different summary clarifies the issue better, feel free to change it.
Attached build log and emerge --info.

NOTE:
If you need further logs, feel free to ask.

Excellent, then arm can be part of the next stable bug again.
