File /usr/include/qt4/Gentoo/gentoo-qconfig.h gets installed with x11-libs/qt-core but really doesn't belong to any package (per equery b). So it does look like cruft, but if this file doesn't exist, the qt4-apps fail to compile.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge qt-core
2. equery b /usr/include/qt4/Gentoo/gentoo-qconfig.h


Actual Results:  
equery doesn't report it to belong to any package

Expected Results:  
equery should report that this file belongs to x11-libs/qt-core

There are some other files near /usr/include/qt4/Gentoo/gentoo-qconfig.h, but they do belong to the corresponding packages, i.e.
[ Searching for file(s) gentoo-qt-core-qconfig.h in *... ]
x11-libs/qt-core-4.4.2 (/usr/include/qt4/Gentoo/gentoo-qt-core-qconfig.h)
[ Searching for file(s) gentoo-qt-dbus-qconfig.h in *... ]
x11-libs/qt-dbus-4.4.2 (/usr/include/qt4/Gentoo/gentoo-qt-dbus-qconfig.h)

/usr/include/qt4/Gentoo/gentoo-qconfig.h is generated by generate_qconfigs() in qt4-build.eclass in pkg_postinst() and pkg_postrm() phases.

Yeah, but as I said this file doesn't belong to any package, but it is required for qt4 apps to build. Why is it not possible to move the generation of this file to another stage, so that it will be installed in normal way as all other files and will be identified as belonging to the right package but not as cruft.

The file belongs to all the Qt modules together. The fact that it doesn't belong to any specific package is the result of our move from monolithic to split ebuilds. I don't know if there is any way to mark it as belonging anywhere. And I don't see it as causing any problems the way it is. I am leaning towards closing this bug as "works for me".
