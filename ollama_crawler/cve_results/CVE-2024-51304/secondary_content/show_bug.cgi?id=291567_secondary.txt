It would be nice if per default there where desktop menu entries for
notepad
uninstaller
winecfg
"browse c: drive"

and icons for the above as well as for Wine itself, i.e.:
wine.svg
wine-notepad.svg
wine-winecfg.svg
wine-winefile.svg
wine-uninstaller.svg

As a workaround I have defined my own menu entries as per instructions in 
http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wine#Create_Menu_Entries
and using the icons from Ubuntu studio:
http://packages.ubuntu.com/jaunty/ubuntustudio-icon-theme

Reproducible: Always

my understanding is that when you run wine for the first time, it auto creates desktop entries/icons for you
