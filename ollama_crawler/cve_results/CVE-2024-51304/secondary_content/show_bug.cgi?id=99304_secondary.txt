Not sure if this is bugzilla or Opera bug...

other installations of bugzilla (f ex bugs.kde.org) does not show this misbehaviour so i'm pretty sure 
it's an issue of your bugzilla.

i am about to upgrade our bugzilla later today EDT to 2.18.3. if this is still
an issue, please comment on this bug and i can check in with the bugzilla
developers to see if they have heard of this before.

i just tried with opera 8 on my x86 machine, and it works for me (there is no
unexpected logout), so might just be a personal setting. i tried both http and
https on bugs.gentoo.org and had no issues.
