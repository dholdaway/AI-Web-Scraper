Everything is in the subject line. I use systemd and since that it has been upgraded to 3.13.2, it does not start with systemd. systemd start syslog-ng gives the following error message: Failed to start syslog-ng.service: Unit syslog-ng.service not found.

A warning should be printed after emerging syslog-ng with systemd:

"The service file for systemd has changed to support multiple instances. To start the default instance issue:
# systemctl start syslog-ng@default"

Do you have that message in your emerge log?

This message should be shown at the end of emerge ? If so, this is not the case. And systemctl start syslog-ng@default doesn't work either.
It would also be goog to upgrade the wiki page (https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Syslog-ng).

Sorry, I overlooked it. the message is indeed shown. But it doesn't work:

Is syslog-ng still running? Try to check the process list.

If so, try to kill it and start it again.

It was a configuration problem. After running etc-update, it works as expected. But since syslog-ng was not the last package compiled, I din't had a chance to see the message about the change of the service file. A news would not have been bad.
