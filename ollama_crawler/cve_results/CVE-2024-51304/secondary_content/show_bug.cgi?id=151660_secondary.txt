Description

app-office/openoffice-bin-2.0.3 emerged on a clean 2006.1 on amd64, emerges ok but fails to run with:

"/usr/lib32/openoffice/program/soffice.bin: error while loading shared libraries: libXext.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"

is there a missing dependency on something in modular X?

apparently it requires app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-xlibs-7.0-r2 - should this be a dependency?

It already depends on emul-linux-x86-xlibs (and 7.0-r2 is the only version in the tree).
