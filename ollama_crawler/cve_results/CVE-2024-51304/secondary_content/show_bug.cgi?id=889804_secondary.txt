@ERROR: invalid uid nobody
rsync error: error starting client-server protocol (code 5) at main.c(1833)
[Receiver=3.2.4]
rsync failed at uri rsync://[89.238.64.78]/gentoo-portage, trying next

% host 89.238.64.78
78.64.238.89.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer banana.gentoo-ev.org.

I suggest this node to removed from its respective pools.

This appears to be operated by the eV?

Looks like it might be OK now.

Sorry, but we don't have the logs from January 2023 any more. So I cannot say what the problem was.

This measure seems a little drastic for a temporary failure, especially when the admins of the mirror in question are not CCed.
