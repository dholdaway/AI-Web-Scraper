Hi,

i'm new to bug wargnling and I've encountered two issues to be assignes to Marijn Schouten who has the email address hkbst@g.o but uses hkBst@g.o in metadata.xml like media-sound/lilypond and another.

Bugzilla complains about "hkBst@g.o not matching anything" when you copy'n'paste the big letter B but accepts the email with lower case b.

Email aliases were case sensitive - theoretical - but nearly everyone turned that sendmail option to ignore the case in aliases. Can bugzilla please behave like this? If not, please poke all devs whom metadata infos get rejected by bugzie.

thanks

When I enter in hkBst@g.o:

Confirm Match

Bugzilla cannot make a conclusive match for one or more of the names and/or email addresses you entered on the previous page.
Please examine the lists of potential matches below and select the one you want, or go back to the previous page to revise the names you entered.

Assignee: 	hkBst@gentoo.org matched Marijn Schouten <hkbst@gentoo.org>

Looks ok to me.

Yeah, it's ok, but is this noisy `please examin` really necessary?

(feel free to RESO/WONT if you think so, I wouldn't mind)
