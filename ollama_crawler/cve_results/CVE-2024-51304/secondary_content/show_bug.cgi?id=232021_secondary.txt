[13]  default/linux/amd64/2008.0 *

dev-libs/popt-1.10.7 failed during an emerge -e system - the SRC_URI would not allow an anonymous ftp login.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
emerge it, or in my case, via emerge -e system

Actual Results:  
530 Guest login disabled

Expected Results:  
Should download and compile

I was able to manually fetch the file and put it into distfiles + successfully resumed:

http://wraptastic.org/pub/rpm-4.4.x/popt-1.10.7.tar.gz

Can reproduce. Please configure GENTOO_MIRRORS in /etc/make.conf or use the mirrorselect utility as described in our install documentation. The file is available on the mirrors.

Which mirror failed, exactly? This looks like a duplicate of bug #232049.

You are correct -- it was the U of Arizona mirror that was giving me problems but, upon failing, it then tried to download from the SRC_URI, which will still not allow anonymous logins (sorry for these bugs, but I've been using that mirror for years now and never had it fail before - when it failed and then the SRC_URI failed as well, I assumed the problem was elsewhere).

I can't say whether that's important enough to fix or whatever, but again, the issue of not allowing logins is with the SRC_URI.  Since this is available (I guess) on other mirrors, the fact that SRC_URI fails may not be important to you.

This is fixed in >=dev-libs/popt-1.12.

Can't reproduce this , files are downloaded as usual from mirrors.
