Created attachment 95496 [details]
patch to en/ldap-howto.xml

Rationale for the patch:

It is cumbersome having to copy, paste, edit and then submitting the commands. With two simple exports, the user will be able to copy & paste without a potential error source and more convenience.

Well, to be honest, your method actually involves significantly more typing! Copying and pasting commands really isn't that hard. You do know all you have to do is hit the up arrow (in bash & most other shells) to get the last command entered, and then just change a few letters to the new file location, right?

The existing way is much simpler, and works perfectly well.

But thanks for the suggestion; Linux is proof that there's more than one way to do it. :)
