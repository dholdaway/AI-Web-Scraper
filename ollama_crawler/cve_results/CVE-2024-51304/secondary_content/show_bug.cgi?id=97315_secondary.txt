If I search for bugs in a popular
package, bugzilla reports 200 bugs,
without any way of obtaining the
bugs not shown among the first 200.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Search a popular package for bugs
Actual Results:  
200 bugs returned but no way to see the
total number of bugs or the bugs not
returned in the first 200.

Expected Results:  
Would like to see a "NEXT" function to
continue searching for remaining bugs.

Is this still an issue? I just searched for large amounts of bugs (like
selecting the gentoo sparc component) and came back with 284 bugs, including the
listing of the total bugs found.

" Thu Jun 30 2005 08:09:18 PDT
217 bugs found."

Doesn't work for me.

I go to this page:

http://bugs.gentoo.org/query.cgi

Status: all
Product: All
Words: sparc

And it comes back with only 200.
