Emerging smartmontools causes a Digest Verification Failure.
I have seen this error first time at least two weeks ago, I did three emerge ---sync since that moment but the problem is still here.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge smartmontools
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
!!! Digest verification failed:
!!! /usr/portage/sys-apps/smartmontools/smartmontools-5.38.ebuild
!!! Reason: Filesize does not match recorded size
!!! Got: 1368
!!! Expected: 1379


Expected Results:  
successful emerging

The ebuild is there for ages. See http://sources.gentoo.org/viewcvs.py/gentoo-x86/sys-apps/smartmontools/ . It works for me without issues. Probably, the rsync server you're using is broken. Reopen if necessary. I close the bug as WORKSFORME.
