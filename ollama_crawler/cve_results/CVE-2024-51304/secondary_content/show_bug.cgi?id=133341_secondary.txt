it works with USE="-gstreamer"

So the sandbox violation accures when i have the gstreamer USE flag...

after a hint from this [1] bug I found on breakmygentoo by googling, i took a look at the media-video/totem ebuild. i just copied the addpredict lines for the touched directories to src_compile(), and emotion then emerged fine:

src_compile() {
	#fixme: why does it need write access here, probably need to set up a fake
	#home in /var/tmp like other pkgs do
	addpredict "/root/.gconfd"
	addpredict "/root/.gconf"
	addpredict "/root/.gnome2"

as the 'fixme:' indicates, this isn't necessarily a good solution, but it works for now. I've been tring to figure out why these files are being touched, but i can't even figure out what is touching them.

Please re-open. I can still produce the problem most readily.

perhaps there is a difference in installed versions of plugins?

Re-emerge gnome-doc-utils and try again.

I cannot reproduce this. Installing emotion with gestreamer USE-flag installed those gstreamer packages:

media-plugins/gst-plugins-ffmpeg
media-libs/gst-plugins-good
media-libs/gst-plugins-base
media-libs/gstreamer

Please reopen/add a comment, if it is still reproduceable and add the package/plugin that produces this behaviour.
