I have decided to upgrade the X.Org ATI drivers (I am using live ebuilds from X11 overlay), but I was unable to do so because libdrm and xf86-video-ati are using EAPI-4 now. I would like to ask for maintaining EAPI-3 versions of those ebuilds until EAPI-4 is supported by stable portage version - those ebuilds are very important for many Gentoo users because they are the only way to get reliable composite desktop and 3D acceleration on modern ATI/AMD (Radeon HD 5000 series and later) cards, and not everyone is brave enough to use alpha version of portage (after several problems I have encountered in the past I am not brave enough anymore...)

Reproducible: Always

Use more recent Portage, then.

This is testing overlay.
We dont put any eapi4 ebuilds to main tree so we wont limit your choices, but overlay is MENT for us to do some development. Which means that you can
a) switch to ~portage
b) dont use live versions
c) wait ~1 month for stable portage that will support it

Sorry for the inconvinience but we really need to do the development and testing of new stuff somewhere.

Also portage supports eapi4 since 2.1.9.31
