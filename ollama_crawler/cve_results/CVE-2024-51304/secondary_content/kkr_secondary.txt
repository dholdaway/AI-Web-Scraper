35 Note	to	All	Pages • All figures in this presentation are as of December 31, 2023, unless otherwise  specifically indicated.  Notes	to	Page	2	–	Fourth	Quarter	2023	Highlights • Net Cash and Total Investments is calculated as Cash and Short-term Investments, less  Debt Obligations – KKR and KFN, plus Investments and Global Atlantic Book Value.  Please see the endnote for page 15 for information about the term "investments." Notes	to	Page	3	–	Fourth	Quarter	2023	Segment	Earnings • The amount of tax benefit from equity-based compensation for 4Q'23 and 4Q'22 was  $14.9 million and $19.4 million, respectively, and for FY'23 and FY'22 was $51.3 million  and $65.4 million, respectively. Its inclusion in After-tax Distributable Earnings had the  effect of increasing this metric for 4Q'23 and 4Q'22 both by 2%, and for FY'23 and  FY'22 both by 2%. Notes	to	Page	5	–	Assets	Under	Management • Perpetual capital refers to a component of AUM that has an indefinite term and for  which there is no predetermined requirement to return invested capital to investors  upon the realization of investments. Perpetual capital includes the AUM of our  registered funds, certain unregistered funds, listed companies, and insurance  companies, and it excludes our traditional private equity funds, similarly structured  investment funds, and hedge fund partnerships. Investors should not view this  component of our AUM as being permanent without exception, because it can be  subject to material reductions and even termination. Perpetual capital is subject to  material reductions from changes in valuation and withdrawals by or payments to  investors, clients and policyholders (including through elections by investors to redeem  their fund investments, periodic dividends, and payment obligations under insurance  policies and reinsurance agreements) as well as termination by a client of, or failure to  renew, its investment management agreement with KKR.  Notes	to	Page	6	–	Additional	Capital	Detail • KKR’s portion of Uncalled Commitments to its investment funds includes $4.8 billion,  $1.9 billion and $1.0 billion to its Private Equity, Real Assets and Credit and Liquid  Strategies business lines, respectively. Notes	to	Page	7	–	Fund	Investment	Performance • Traditional Private Equity Portfolio refers to the portfolio of investments held by all  KKR’s private equity flagship funds. This portfolio does not include investments from  KKR’s growth equity funds or core investments. • Opportunistic Real Estate Portfolio refers to the portfolio of investments held by KKR’s  flagship opportunistic real estate equity funds. This portfolio does not include  investments from KKR's core plus real estate funds or real estate credit funds. Important	Information	−	Endnotes • Infrastructure Portfolio refers to the portfolio of investments held by KKR’s flagship core  plus infrastructure equity funds. This portfolio does not include investments from KKR’s  core infrastructure fund, KKR Diversified Core Infrastructure. • The Leveraged Credit Composite refers to the composite of certain investment  portfolios made in KKR’s collateralized loan obligations and U.S. and European  leveraged credit strategies including leveraged loans, high-yield bonds and  opportunistic credit.  • The Alternative Credit Composite refers to the composite of certain investment  portfolios made in KKR's private credit strategy, including direct lending (including our  business development company), asset-based finance and junior capital, and in the  Strategic Investments Group ("SIG") strategy. Funds and separately managed accounts  in liquidation or discontinued strategies are excluded.  • For a list of our carry paying funds, see the Investment Vehicle Summary on pages 21 to  23. See also “Important Information – Other Legal Disclosures” regarding past  performance and investment returns. Notes	to	Page	13	–	Insurance	Segment • Net investment income represents income earned on invested assets, net of  investment-related expenses, including investment management fees paid to KKR.  • Net cost of insurance represents the net cost of funding institutional and individual  products – interest credited or incurred, benefits incurred, the associated insurance  expenses, net of any premiums, fees and other income earned. • The pending Manulife block reinsurance transaction is expected to close in the first half  of 2024, subject to closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. • Estimated or approximate assets with respect to signed block reinsurance transactions  may not equal assets transferred at closing. Actual assets may fluctuate depending on  many factors, including terms of the transaction, change in status of the policies and  market fluctuations. Notes	to	Page	14	–	Book	Value • Assuming that we had paid (i) 65% of the unrealized carried interest earned by the  funds that allocate 40% and 43% to the carry pool and (ii) 15% of the unrealized gains in  our Principal Activities business line (in each case at the mid-point of the range), our  book value as of December 31, 2023 would have been reduced by approximately $1.88  per adjusted share, compared to our reported book value of $30.95 per adjusted share  on such date. • Please see the endnote for page 15 for information about the term "investments." 

 




36 Notes	to	Page	15	–	Investments	Detail • Investments is a term used solely for purposes of financial presentation of a portion of  KKR’s balance sheet and includes majority ownership of subsidiaries that operate KKR’s  asset management, broker-dealer and other businesses, including the general partner  interests of KKR’s investment funds, controlling interests in core private equity  companies, and the Global Atlantic insurance companies. KKR's asset management  business includes a core private equity investment strategy, which involves acquiring  and managing controlling interests in operating companies intended to be held over a  long period of time.  • Private Equity includes KKR private equity funds, co-investments alongside such KKR  sponsored private equity funds, and other opportunistic investments. Equity  investments in other asset classes, such as core, growth, energy, real estate,  infrastructure, leveraged credit and alternative credit appear in these other asset  classes. • Top 5 Investments include the top five investments based on their fair values as of  December 31, 2023. Top 5 Investments exclude (i) investments expected to be  syndicated, (ii) investments expected to be transferred in connection with a new  fundraising, (iii) investments in funds and other entities that are owned by one or more  third parties and established for the purpose of making investments, and (iv) the  portion of any investment that may be held through collateralized loan obligations or  levered multi-asset investment vehicles, if any. Accordingly, this list of Top 5  Investments should not be relied upon as a substitute for the “Investment Holdings by  Asset Class" pie chart on page 15 for information about the asset class exposure of  KKR's balance sheet. The investments in this list do not deduct fund or vehicle level  debt, if any, incurred in connection with funding the investment.  The fair value figures  include the co-investment and the limited partner and/or general partner interests  held by KKR in the underlying investment, if applicable. Notes	to	Page	17	–	Duration	of	Capital • Please see endnote for page 5 for information about the term "perpetual capital." • "Other" in the chart primarily includes hedge fund partnerships and certain leveraged  credit funds.  Notes	to	Page	18	–	Assets	Under	Management	Rollforward • For the three months ended December 31, 2023, Distributions and Other includes $71  million of redemptions by fund investors in Real Assets and $2,971 million of  redemptions by fund investors in Credit and Liquid Strategies. • For the year ended December 31, 2023, Distributions and Other includes $311 million  of redemptions by fund investors in Real Assets and $8,036 million of redemptions by  fund investors in Credit and Liquid Strategies.  Important	Information	−	Endnotes	(cont’d) Notes	to	Page	19	–	Fee	Paying	Assets	Under	Management	Rollforward • For the three months ended December 31, 2023, Distributions and Other includes net  changes in fee base of certain Real Assets funds of $430 million, $71 million of  redemptions by fund investors in Real Assets and $2,971 million of redemptions by fund  investors in Credit and Liquid Strategies. • For the year ended December 31, 2023, Distributions and Other includes net changes in  fee base of certain Real Assets funds of $805 million, $311 million of redemptions by  fund investors in Real Assets, and $8,036 million of redemptions by fund investors in  Credit and Liquid Strategies.  Notes	to	Pages	21	to	23	–	Investment	Vehicle	Summary • The start date represents the start of the fund's investment period as defined in the  fund's governing documents and may or may not be the same as the date upon which  management fees begin to accrue.  • The end date represents the end of the fund's investment period as defined in the  fund's governing documents and is generally not the date upon which management  fees cease to accrue. For funds that initially charge management fees on the basis of  committed capital, the end date is generally the date on or after which the  management fees begin to be calculated instead on the basis of invested capital and  may, for certain funds, begin to be calculated using a lower rate.  • This table includes investment vehicles which are not investment funds. The terms  investments and investment vehicles are terms used solely for purposes of financial  presentation. Notes	to	Pages	25	–	Investments	Detail	-	Core	Private	Equity • Unless otherwise indicated, gross multiple of invested capital ("MOIC") measure the  aggregate value generated by a fund's investments in absolute terms. Each MOIC is  calculated by adding together the total realized and unrealized values of a fund's  investments and dividing by the total amount of capital invested by the fund. Such  amounts do not give effect to the allocation of realized and unrealized carried interest  or the payment of any applicable management fees or organizational expenses.  • Unless otherwise indicated, internal rates of returns ("IRRs") measure the aggregate  annual compounded returns generated by a fund's investments over a holding period,  including, in many cases, where an investment has not yet been exited and the holding  period end date is not yet known. As a result, an investment's future final IRR calculated  after the exact holding period is known may differ, perhaps materially, from the IRR that  is shown before the investments is exited. "Gross IRRs" are calculated before giving  effect to the allocation of carried interest and the payment of any applicable  management fees and organizational expenses. 

 




37 Important	Information	−	Non-GAAP	and	Other	Measures Non-GAAP	and	Segment	Measures The key non-GAAP and other operating and performance measures that follow are used by  management in making operational and resource deployment decisions as well as assessing  the performance of KKR's business. They include certain financial measures that are  calculated and presented using methodologies other than in accordance with U.S. generally  accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP measures, including after-tax  distributable earnings (“DE”), distributable operating earnings, fee related earnings (“FRE”),  total asset management segment revenues and book value, are presented prior to giving  effect to the allocation of income (loss) among KKR & Co. Inc. and holders of certain  securities exchangeable into shares of common stock of KKR & Co. Inc. and as such represent  the entire KKR business in total. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are presented  without giving effect to the consolidation of the investment funds and collateralized  financing entities (“CFEs”) that KKR manages. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures on a supplemental basis to our GAAP  results is helpful to stockholders in assessing the overall performance of KKR's business.  These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for financial measures  calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the  most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with  GAAP, where applicable, are included under the “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP  Measures" section of this Appendix.  We also caution readers that these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the  calculations made by other investment managers, and as a result, may not be directly  comparable to similarly titled financial measures presented by other investment managers.  • After-tax	 Distributable	 Earnings	 is a non-GAAP performance measure of KKR’s  earnings, which is derived from KKR’s reported segment results. After-tax distributable  earnings is used to assess the performance of KKR’s business operations and measures  the earnings potentially available for distribution to its equity holders or reinvestment  into its business. After-tax distributable earnings is equal to Distributable Operating  Earnings less Interest Expense, Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and  Income Taxes on Operating Earnings. Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock  dividends have been excluded from After-tax Distributable Earnings (for the periods  when this preferred stock was still outstanding), because the definition of Adjusted  Shares used to calculate After-tax Distributable Earnings per Adjusted Share assumes  that all shares of Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock have been converted  to shares of common stock of KKR & Co. Inc. Income Taxes on Operating Earnings  represents the (i) amount of income taxes that would be paid assuming that all pre-tax  Asset Management distributable earnings were allocated to KKR & Co. Inc. and taxed at  the same effective rate, which assumes that all securities exchangeable into shares of  common stock of KKR & Co. Inc. were exchanged and (ii) the amount of income taxes on  Insurance Segment Operating Earnings. Income taxes on Insurance Segment Operating Earnings represent the total current and  deferred tax expense or benefit on income before taxes adjusted to eliminate the  impact of the tax expense or benefit associated with the non-operating adjustments.  Income Taxes on Operating Earnings includes the benefit of tax deductions arising from  equity-based compensation, which reduces operating income taxes during the period.  Equity based compensation expense is excluded from After-tax Distributable Earnings,  because (i) KKR believes that the cost of equity awards granted to employees does not  contribute to the earnings potentially available for distributions to its equity holders or  reinvestment into its business and (ii) excluding this expense makes KKR’s reporting  metric more comparable to the corresponding metric presented by other publicly  traded companies in KKR’s industry, which KKR believes enhances an investor’s ability to  compare KKR’s performance to these other companies. If tax deductions from equity- based compensation were to be excluded from Income Taxes on Operating Earnings,  KKR’s After-tax Distributable Earnings would be lower and KKR’s effective tax rate would  appear to be higher, even though a lower amount of income taxes would have actually  been paid or payable during the period. KKR separately discloses the amount of tax  deduction from equity-based compensation for the period reported and the effect of its  inclusion in After-tax Distributable Earnings for the period. KKR makes these  adjustments when calculating After-tax Distributable Earnings in order to more  accurately reflect the net realized earnings that are expected to be or become available  for distribution to KKR’s equity holders or reinvestment into KKR’s business. However,  After-tax Distributable Earnings does not represent and is not used to calculate actual  dividends under KKR’s dividend policy, which is a fixed amount per period, and After-tax  Distributable Earnings should not be viewed as a measure of KKR’s liquidity. • Book	Value	is a non-GAAP performance measure of the net assets of KKR and is used by  management primarily in assessing the unrealized value of KKR’s net assets presented  on a basis that (i) excludes the net assets that are allocated to investors in KKR’s  investment funds and other noncontrolling interest holders, (ii) includes the net assets  that are attributable to certain securities exchangeable into shares of common stock of  KKR & Co. Inc., and (iii) includes KKR’s ownership of the net assets of Global Atlantic. We  believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the  net assets of KKR excluding those net assets that are allocated to investors in KKR’s  investment funds and other noncontrolling interest holders. KKR's book value includes  the net impact of KKR's tax assets and liabilities as calculated under GAAP. Series C  Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock has been included in book value, because the  definition of adjusted shares used to calculate book value per adjusted share assumes  that all shares of Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, had, prior to its  redemption, been converted to shares of common stock of KKR & Co. Inc. To calculate  Global Atlantic book value and to make it more comparable with the corresponding  metric presented by other publicly traded companies in Global Atlantic’s industry,  Global Atlantic book value excludes (i) accumulated other comprehensive income and  (ii) accumulated change in fair value of reinsurance balances and related assets, net of  income tax. 

 




38 Non-GAAP	and	Segment	Measures	(cont’d) • Distributable	 Operating	 Earnings	 is a non-GAAP performance measure that KKR  believes is useful to stockholders as it provides a supplemental measure of our  operating performance without taking into account items that KKR does not believe  arise from or relate directly to KKR's operations. Distributable Operating Earnings  excludes: (i) equity-based compensation charges, (ii) amortization of acquired  intangibles, (iii) strategic corporate-related charges and (iv) non-recurring items, if any.  Strategic corporate-related charges arise from corporate actions and consist primarily  of (i) impairments, (ii) transaction costs from strategic acquisitions, and (iii) depreciation  on real estate that KKR owns and occupies. Inter-segment transactions are not  eliminated from segment results when management considers those transactions in  assessing the results of the respective segments. These transactions include (i)  management fees earned by KKR as the investment adviser for Global Atlantic insurance  companies and (ii) interest income and expense based on lending arrangements where  one or more KKR subsidiaries borrow from a Global Atlantic insurance subsidiary. Inter- segment transactions are recorded by each segment based on the definitive documents  that contain arms' length terms and comply with applicable regulatory requirements.  Distributable Operating Earnings represents operating earnings of KKR’s Asset  Management and Insurance segments. • Asset	Management	Segment	Operating	Earnings	is the segment profitability measure  used to make operating decisions and to assess the performance of the Asset  Management segment and is comprised of: (i) Fee Related Earnings, (ii) Realized  Performance Income, (iii) Realized Performance Income Compensation, (iv) Realized  Investment Income, and (v) Realized Investment Income Compensation. Asset  Management Segment Operating Earnings excludes the impact of: (i) unrealized gains  (losses) on investments, (ii) unrealized carried interest, and (iii) related unrealized  carried interest compensation (i.e. the carry pool). Management fees earned by KKR as  the adviser, manager or sponsor for its investment funds, vehicles and accounts,  including its Global Atlantic insurance companies, are included in Asset Management  Segment Operating Earnings.  • Insurance	 Segment	Operating	 Earnings	 is the segment profitability measure used to  make operating decisions and to assess the performance of the Insurance segment. This  measure is presented before income taxes and is comprised of: (i) Net Investment  Income, (ii) Net Cost of Insurance, (iii) General, Administrative, and Other Expenses, and  (iv) Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests. The non-operating  adjustments made to derive Insurance Segment Operating Earnings excludes the impact  of: (i) investment gains (losses) which include realized gains (losses) related to asset/ liability matching investments strategies and unrealized investment gains (losses) and  (ii) non-operating changes in policy liabilities and derivatives which includes (a) changes  in the fair value of market risk benefits and other policy liabilities measured at fair value  and related benefit payments, (b) fees attributed to guaranteed benefits, (c) derivatives  used to manage the risks associated with policy liabilities, and (d) losses at contract  issuance on payout annuities. Important	Information	−	Non-GAAP	and	Other	Measures	(cont’d) Insurance Segment Operating Earnings includes (i) realized gains and losses not related  to asset/liability matching investments strategies and (ii) the investment management  costs that are earned by KKR as the investment adviser of the Global Atlantic insurance  companies. • Fee	 Related	 Earnings	 (“FRE”)	 is a performance measure used to assess the Asset  Management segment’s generation of profits from revenues that are measured and  received on a recurring basis and are not dependent on future realization events. KKR  believes this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the  profitability of KKR’s fee generating asset management and capital markets businesses  and other recurring revenue streams. FRE equals (i) Management Fees, including fees  paid by the Insurance segment to the Asset Management segment and fees paid by  certain insurance co-investment vehicles, (ii) Transaction and Monitoring Fees, Net and  (iii) Fee Related Performance Revenues, less (x) Fee Related Compensation, and (y)  Other Operating Expenses. • Fee Related Performance Revenues refers to the realized portion of Incentive Fees  from certain AUM that has an indefinite term and for which there is no immediate  requirement to return invested capital to investors upon the realization of  investments. Fee related performance revenues consists of performance fees (i) to  be received from our investment funds, vehicles and accounts on a recurring basis,  and (ii) that are not dependent on a realization event involving investments held by  the investment fund, vehicle or account. • Fee Related Compensation refers to the compensation expense, excluding equity- based compensation, paid from (i) Management Fees, (ii) Transaction and  Monitoring Fees, Net, and (iii) Fee Related Performance Revenues. • Other Operating Expenses represents the sum of (i) occupancy and related charges  and (ii) other operating expenses. • Total	 Asset	 Management	 Segment	 Revenues	 is a performance measure that  represents the realized revenues of the Asset Management segment (which excludes  unrealized carried interest and unrealized net gains (losses) on investments) and is the  sum of (i) Management Fees, (ii) Transaction and Monitoring Fees, Net, (iii) Fee Related  Performance Revenues, (iv) Realized Performance Income, and (v) Realized Investment  Income. KKR believes that this performance measure is useful to stockholders as it  provides additional insight into the realized revenues generated by KKR's asset  management segment. 

 




39 Other	Terms	and	Capital	Metrics • Adjusted	 shares	 represents shares of common stock of KKR & Co. Inc. outstanding  under GAAP adjusted to include (i) for any reporting period prior to the redemption of  the Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred, adjusted shares included the number of  shares of common stock of KKR & Co. Inc. assumed to be issuable upon conversion of  the Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and (ii) certain securities  exchangeable into shares of common stock of KKR & Co. Inc. Weighted average  adjusted shares is used in the calculation of After-tax Distributable Earnings per  Adjusted Share, and Adjusted Shares is used in the calculation of Book Value per  Adjusted Share. • Assets	 Under	 Management	 (“AUM”)	 represent the assets managed, advised or  sponsored by KKR from which KKR is entitled to receive management fees or  performance income (currently or upon a future event), general partner capital, and  assets managed, advised or sponsored by our strategic BDC partnership and the hedge  fund and other managers in which KKR holds an ownership interest. We believe this  measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the capital raising  activities of KKR and its hedge fund and other managers and the overall activity in their  investment funds and other managed or sponsored capital. KKR calculates the amount  of AUM as of any date as the sum of: (i) the fair value of the investments of KKR's  investment funds and certain co-investment vehicles; (ii) uncalled capital commitments  from these funds, including uncalled capital commitments from which KKR is currently  not earning management fees or performance income; (iii) the asset value of the Global  Atlantic insurance companies; (iv) the par value of outstanding CLOs; (v) KKR's pro rata  portion of the AUM of hedge fund and other managers in which KKR holds an  ownership interest; (vi) all of the AUM of KKR's strategic BDC partnership; (vii) the  acquisition cost of invested assets of certain non-US real estate investment trusts and  (viii) the value of other assets managed or sponsored by KKR. The pro rata portion of  the AUM of hedge fund and other managers is calculated based on KKR’s percentage  ownership interest in such entities multiplied by such entity’s respective AUM. KKR's  definition of AUM (i) is not based on any definition of AUM that may be set forth in the  governing documents of the investment funds, vehicles, accounts or other entities  whose capital is included in this definition, (ii) includes assets for which KKR does not  act as an investment adviser, and (iii) is not calculated pursuant to any regulatory  definitions.  • Capital	 Invested	 is the aggregate amount of capital invested by (i) KKR’s investment  funds and Global Atlantic insurance companies, (ii) KKR's Principal Activities business  line as a co-investment, if any, alongside KKR’s investment funds, and (iii) KKR's Principal  Activities business line in connection with a syndication transaction conducted by KKR's  Capital Markets business line, if any. Capital invested is used as a measure of  investment activity at KKR during a given period. We believe this measure is useful to  stockholders as it provides a measure of capital deployment across KKR’s business lines. Important	Information	−	Non-GAAP	and	Other	Measures	(cont’d) Capital invested includes investments made using investment financing arrangements  like credit facilities, as applicable. Capital invested excludes (i) investments in certain  leveraged credit strategies, (ii) capital invested by KKR’s Principal Activities business line  that is not a co-investment alongside KKR’s investment funds, and (iii) capital invested  by KKR’s Principal Activities business line that is not invested in connection with a  syndication transaction by KKR’s Capital Markets business line. Capital syndicated by  KKR's Capital Markets business line to third parties other than KKR’s investment funds  or Principal Activities business line is not included in capital invested.   • Fee	Paying	AUM	 (“FPAUM”)	 represents only the AUM from which KKR is entitled to  receive management fees. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it  provides additional insight into the capital base upon which KKR earns management  fees. FPAUM is the sum of all of the individual fee bases that are used to calculate KKR's  and its hedge fund and BDC partnership management fees and differs from AUM in the  following respects: (i) assets and commitments from which KKR is not entitled to receive  a management fee are excluded (e.g., assets and commitments with respect to which it  is entitled to receive only performance income or is otherwise not currently entitled to  receive a management fee) and (ii) certain assets, primarily in its private equity funds,  are reflected based on capital commitments and invested capital as opposed to fair  value because fees are not impacted by changes in the fair value of underlying  investments. • Uncalled	 Commitments	 is the aggregate amount of unfunded capital commitments  that KKR’s investment funds and carry-paying co-investment vehicles have received  from partners to contribute capital to fund future investments and the amount of  uncalled commitments is not reduced by capital invested using borrowings under an  investment fund’s subscription facility until capital is called from our fund investors. We  believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the  amount of capital that is available to KKR’s investment funds and carry paying co- investment vehicles to make future investments. Uncalled commitments are not  reduced for investments completed using fund-level investment financing  arrangements or investments we have committed to make but remain unfunded at the  reporting date.
