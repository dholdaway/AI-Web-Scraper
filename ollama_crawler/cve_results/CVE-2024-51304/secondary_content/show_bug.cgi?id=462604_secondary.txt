I don't assume the machine ran out of memory here.

I have 8 Gig RAM and would expect a system crash if it ran out.

It is more compiler bug than libreoffice one.

Try to remove fexceptions from your cflags or trigger the crash once more if it is at least reprodudable.

Also the crash can be caused by faluty hw so try to run memtest on the box (at least lately my experience with ram is that 2 out of 8 new are faluty after a while).

No reaction from user for testing, can't reproduce myself, closing as worksforme.
