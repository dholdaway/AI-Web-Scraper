Since some days I've noticed that my authenticated session on the forums lasts very little time (often less than an hour).

This causes me to have to frequently go through login screens and, most important, to lose unread status on new posts.

Sessions used to last weeks.

Is this a wanted behaviour or is it just a fault of my browser (google-chrome beta) ? I don't experience this issue in other phpbb based forum I attend.

Thanks

Reproducible: Always

We have not changed any cookie settings on the forums recently so it's likely to be your browser and/or browser settings.

phpBB sets two cookies when you log in, phpbb2mysql_sid_s which is the session ID and is valid until the end of your browser session. The other phpbb2mysql_data_s is used to track if you have the "log me in automatically" ticked and expires one year after you last logged in.

You should be able to see these cookies by going to:
chrome://chrome/settings/cookies

Can you log in to the forums and see when that says the phpbb2mysql_data_s cookie should expire?

it should expire on July the 30th 2014 and, effectively, I was automatically logged in on the forums today.

My problem is that this doesn't happen every time.

It would be interesting to see if the cookie is set when it doesn't work and if it is set what the expiration date is.

But I'm thinking this is more likely to be a problem with your browser, either it isn't honouring the cookie expiration date or you have some setting enabled which clears cookies when you close the browser.

If you could find a way to reproduce the problem that would help with finding out where the problem is, i.e. does it happen after you've closed the browser?

It happened again.

I've got no "phpbb2mysql_sid_s" but just a "phpbb2mysql_sid" and is set to expire when the navigation session ends.

The _s cookies are set when you use https, are you using both http and https to connect to the forums?

I think I've used http only (old bookmarks + lazyness).

Now I've tried to switch to https and see what happens.

I know that mixing them can cause problems but either way the _data or _data_s cookies should still be there. What does it say in your cookie settings?

Settings -> Show advanced settings -> "Privacy" section -> Content settings -> 
"Cookies" section

I've got the advised option selected ("allow local save").

Closing this as there has not been any activity in a while, and it doesn't seem to be a widely spread problem (at this time at least).

Thanks for the report!
