Description

When you are reading the handbook for the first time, the guide isn't specific on which disk medium you should be picking.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:




When I was reading this guide for the first time the guide was very sketchy when you read part 1 chapter 2. I feel some kind of highlighted paragraph should explain in more detail that the guide is completely centered around the minimal cd. 

It is only listed at the top where you select part 1 chapter 2

"You can install Gentoo in many ways. This chapter explains how to install Gentoo using the minimal Installation CD although installation through the Installer LiveCD is possible as well."

On the actual chapter which people are more apt to read, I would recommend having mentioned that the entire guide is based off of the minimal installation.

We already mention that if you follow the networked handbook, we're assuming you're using the minimal CD, as evidenced in the download/burn/boot instrucions. We provide numerous warnings in the index/TOC pages and the actual handbook text as to which CD/install method you'll be using, and whether or not you'll be performing a networked or networkless install.
