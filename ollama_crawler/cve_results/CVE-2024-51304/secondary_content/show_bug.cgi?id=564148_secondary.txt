Looks like an intentional upstream change which is not

Looks like an intentional upstream change which is not a problem if you use pkgconfig to get include paths.

If you don't have a problem with in-tree ebuilds, I will close this as invalid/wontfix.

I use a cmake module to obtain path, I'll look to modify it if it is intentional from gstreamer upstream.

Oki, mea culpa

building from an empty directory without cmake cache, include path is now correct. Sorry for that.
