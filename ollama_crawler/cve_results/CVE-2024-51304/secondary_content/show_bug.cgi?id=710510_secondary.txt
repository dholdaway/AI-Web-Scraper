Description

/etc/X11/startDM.sh is installed without execute permission.  When the xdm service is started, this produces an error something like this:

/etc/init.d/xdm: line 180: /etc/X11/startDM.sh: Permission denied

sudo chmod +x /etc/X11/startDM.sh fixes this, but the ebuild should do this.

Reproducible: Always

I am unable to reproduce it, even with purging xinit package and emerging it again.

Can you reproduce it localle? I wonder if perhaps you did something locally that could make it that way, maybe with etc-update or dispatch-config?

Also spliting it into two lines does not change anything, as the doexe ebuild helper runs loop over "$@".

Feel free if you can reproduce it.
