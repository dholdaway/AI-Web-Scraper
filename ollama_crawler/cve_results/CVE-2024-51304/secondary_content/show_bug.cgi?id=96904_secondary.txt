Description


Pedro Palhoto





          2005-06-23 16:15:30 UTC
        

QSampler needs to be unmasked (in /etc/portage/package.unmask) and ~x86-ified   
(in /etc/portage/package.keywords), along with its dependencies,   
media-libs/libgig and media-libs/liblscp.    
    
 liblscp emerged without a hassle. libgig is the real problem. 
    
 The file is retrieved successfully from   
http://stud.fh-heilbronn.de/~cschoene/projects/libgig/libgig-2.0.0.tar.bz2 .   
Length: 62,603 Bytes.    
    
 But then, without any apparent reason:    
 
[code] 
!!! Couldn't download libgig-2.0.0.tar.bz2. Aborting. 
[/code] 
   
 And therefore, the emerge doesn't even compile.    
    
 I tried removing the file several times, downloaded manually, emerged with   
--oneshot, but no luck.    
  
[Original text from http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-351228.html]  

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.1 emerge -1 libgig (after unmasking and placing ~x86) 
OR 
1.2 emerge qsampler 
   
Actual Results:  
!!! Couldn't download libgig-2.0.0.tar.bz2. Aborting. 

Expected Results:  
The libgig emerge process should accept the downloaded file and move on to the   
compilation stage of the emerge process.

More detailed information, during emerge -1d libgig: 
    The file is already fully retrieved; nothing to do.

(In reply to comment #2)   
> Emerging libgig-2.0.1 (using Portage Overlay):   
> !!! no configure script found    
   
To correct this, I commented out the following line in the libgig-2.0.1 ebuild   
file I had in Portage Overlay:   
   
#S="${WORKDIR}/${PN}"   
  
===//===  
  
This still doesn't correct the actual problem for libgig-2.0.0, the most recent  
ebuild in the Portage tree.  
  
BTW, QSampler 0.1.0 emerged and works without a problem. I will try Overlaying 
to QSampler 0.1.1 soon.
