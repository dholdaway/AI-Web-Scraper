Description

I'm reporting this bug because the package in summary breaks when forcing --as-needed on through spec files (check out http://blog.flameeyes.eu/2008/11/14/problems-and-mitigation-strategies-for-as-needed for details).

Check the attached build log.

Thanks,
Diego

I'm not able to reproduce.
Can you please re-verify the status?
