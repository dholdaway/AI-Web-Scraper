I ran in to an issue where mysql was reporting that a table in a database was full. After investigating, I found that the innodb table space is limited on Gentoo to 128M in size. This table space is used FOR ALL TABLES using innodb. This seems extremely small to me.

/etc/mysql/my.cnf:
--
innodb_data_file_path = ibdata1:10M:autoextend:max:128M
--

I removed the :max:128M, restarted mysql and the problem went away. I would suggest removing this or increasing to a sane value. MySQL would be overkill for databases smaller than 128M in my opinion.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install mysql via portage.
2. create a table which uses innodb engine.
3. insert data into table until it is full.
4. profit?

Actual Results:  
table fills after innodb table space reaches 128M (/var/lib/mysql/ibdata1)

Expected Results:  
>128M limit on ALL innodb tables SYSTEM-WIDE.

Then increase it as needed for your particular use. Next time someone will file a bug that the default limit is too high. :)
