Installation of sys-devel/flex fixed the problem.
Is there a dependency in detex missing?

which ebuild are you using ? the one I have here has flex as a dep.

the ebuild from portage.
equery d dev-tex/detex says:

[ Searching for packages depending on dev-tex/detex... ]
app-text/texlive-2007-r3 (dev-tex/detex)

so no dependency to flex?

this checks for packages depending on detex, not what packages detex depends on :)

to check it, use for ex. portageq :

$ portageq metadata / installed dev-tex/detex-2.8-r1 DEPEND
sys-devel/flex

ok:
portageq metadata / installed dev-tex/detex-2.7 DEPEND
virtual/libc sys-devel/flex

so maybe something was wrong with the installation of flex and a (re)installation of flex fixed that.

closing as worksforme, flex should always install libfl.a
