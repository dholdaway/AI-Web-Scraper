Build Identifier: 

gentoolkit has depreciated the command 'etcat -v', but after 6 hours of
searching, I have found no alternative for 'etcat -v'.  The alternative either
non-obvious, and should be put in the depreciation note, or the alternative does
not exist.

(As a workaround, I'm now keeping a binary copy of etcat, and copying that to
all my machines so future "depreciation chaos" won't effect me as much)

Reproducible: Always

It's still installed in /usr/share/doc/gentoolkit-0.2.2/deprecated/etcat/etcat, but I really don't see what's your problem with equery:
