Description

After emerging something, i get these 2 lines:
 * IMPORTANT: 5 news items need reading for repository 'gentoo'.
 * Use eselect news to read news items.

Now 5 news items, and it is rarely increasing (probably when there is new news item added?).
However, when i issue the command: eselect news read new
it says: No news is good news.

Any idea what to do with the news items?

Do you read them as root or as a user?

I try to read the news with both normal user, and root. Same result: No news is good news.

Please post your `emerge --info'.

Do the items show up in "eselect news list"? As unread?

As I remember, eselect news <whatever> returned nothing or 0 result.

Update to this bugreport: I had several problems in my Gentoo for unknown reason. Since I reinstalled it from scratch, everything works better. Thus eselect news works aswell, and I can not reproduce the problem any more. Probably we should close this bugreport as unreproducable.

Closing. Feel free to reopen if the problem should resurface.
