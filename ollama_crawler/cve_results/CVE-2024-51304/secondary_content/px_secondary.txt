      DANBURY, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 25, 2018--Praxair, Inc.
      (NYSE:PX) today reported fourth-quarter net income of $33 million and
      diluted earnings per share of $0.11. These results include transaction
      costs of $14 million after-tax related to the proposed merger with Linde
      AG and a net income tax charge of $394 million related to the U.S. Tax
      Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Reform”). The net tax charge reflects
      the company’s best estimate of Tax Reform and may be adjusted in future
      periods as required. The impact of these charges was $1.41 of diluted
      earnings per share. Excluding these two items, adjusted net income was
      $441 million and diluted earnings per share was $1.52, up 9% and 8%,
      respectively versus prior year.
    

      Praxair’s sales in the fourth quarter were $2,953 million, 12% above the
      prior-year quarter. After adjusting for positive currency translation
      and cost pass-through, sales grew 8%, driven by price attainment and
      higher volumes across all geographic segments and end-markets.

 Inside Praxair Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 M & A - Other   Highlight

 M & A - Other   Highlight
Excluding currency impacts, SG&A increased $24 million driven by acquisitions, cost inflation and higher incentive compensation partially offset by benefits from cost reduction programs.
