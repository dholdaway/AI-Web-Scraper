Description

The NTP ebuild says:

"The way ntp sets and maintains your system time has changed.
Now you can use /etc/init.d/ntp-client to set your time at
boot while you can use /etc/init.d/ntpd to maintain your time
while your machine runs"

That seems to indicate that ntpd and ntp-client should both be started.  However, the wiki says:

"Make sure you are not running ntp-client"

http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Ntp#Server_2

I think the wiki is correct.

/etc/init.d/ntp-client doesn't keep anything running - it runs ntp-client, which sets the system time once and then exits, leaving the NTP ports free for ntpd (or a different NTP daemon) to take over.

Perhaps the wiki should be changed.

If I start ntp-client automatically at boot, it takes about 12 seconds and delays everything which starts after it such as shorewall and local.
