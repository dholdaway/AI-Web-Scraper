Description

I was trying to install mozilla-firefox-bin 2.0.0.1 after a fresh 2006.1 installation. When emerge was trying to install xdpyinfo, it failed with this error:

....
checking for a BSD-compatible install... /bin/install -c
checking for i686-pc-linux-gnu-pkg-config... no
checking for pkg-config... /usr/bin/pkg-config
checking pkg-config is at least version 0.9.0... yes
checking for XDPYINFO... configure: error: Package requirements (xext x11 xtst) were not met:

Package recordproto was not found in the pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing `recordproto.pc'
to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
Package 'recordproto', required by 'Xtst', not found

Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
installed software in a non-standard prefix.

Alternatively, you may set the environment variables XDPYINFO_CFLAGS
and XDPYINFO_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.
See the pkg-config man page for more details.


So I installed by hand recordproto and re-emerged xdpyinfo and everything went OK this time.

x11-libs/libXtst already depends x11-proto/recordproto (and xdpyinfo depends on x11-libs/libXtst).
