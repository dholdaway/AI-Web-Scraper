If GENTOO_MIRRORS is not set, it will default to http://distfiles.gentoo.org/ where the file is available http://distfiles.gentoo.org/distfiles/efibootmgr-0.5.4.tar.gz
That's the whole point of having Gentoo mirrors that when files get deleted from upstream, it will always fallback to the Gentoo mirrors (EXCEPT if user has set broken settings at make.conf for the mirrors)
As in, the whole point is to not have to file these useless bugs :-)

OK, point taken, sorry for the useless bug. Had I been following the handbook, GENTOO_MIRRORS would have been set before emerging grub and the file would have been found.

But just to satisfy my curiosity, when I tried with GENTOO_MIRRORS not set, the first and only source checked was the SRC_URI in the ebuild, not distfiles.gentoo.org. This matches the description in man ebuild (COMMANDS fetch).
