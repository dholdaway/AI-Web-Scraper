Description

OpenRC is not yet btrfs aware. It fails to mount another subvolume during boot. 

localmount | * Mounting local filesystems ...
localmount |mount: /dev/mapper/root is already mounted or /var/portage/tree busy
localmount | /dev/mapper/root is already mounted on /
localmount | * Some local filesystem failed to mount

A btrfs can have thousands of subvolumes. Even if they are different to lvm/zfs, they should be mountable during boot too.

I need more information on this. Specifically, what do I need to do to
mount subvolumes?

I just found out that specifying the subvolid for the default volume in fstab solves the issue.

sorry for the inconveniences.
