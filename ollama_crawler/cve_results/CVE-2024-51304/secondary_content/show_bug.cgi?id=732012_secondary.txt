IIRC proot before 5.2.0_alpha does not support clang

In bug 717914[1] we agreed that we should not add alpha version into portage tree, but, as you can see here[2], this is the last release available and proot development is not very active, so maybe we should reconsider

Probably fixed by commit b678ff1362a8416e109899b4794446c8380dbd5f (which bumps proot version to 5.3.0). At least i can successfully build it with clang.
