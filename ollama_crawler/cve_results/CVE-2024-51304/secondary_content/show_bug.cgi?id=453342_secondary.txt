Hi,

with update libreoffice to 4.0.X my system wants to install openldap, even with -ldap useflag.
Why?

Installing openldap breaks (downgrades) my net-libs/gnutls.

Bug or feature?

Reproducible: Always

While that is an effect of a temporary solution from bug 421463, I'd argue it's a bug in itself.

As for openldap, use 'minimal' useflag - you likely only need the lib.

You are talking about compiling a huge singular packages that depends on a comparatively tiny other package. I guess the answer to your question is obvious, or the OpenOffice team has made a very grave error, indeed.
