I have nvidia-settings-180.22 installed currently.  I did a sync a few days ago and noticed that every time I went to build any package, portage would complain that no digest existed for nvidia-settings-180.27.ebuild.

I checked the Manifest file and nothing existed for nvidia-settings-180.27.ebuild.  I edited the Manifest file and added it myself, only to be presented with another error about the ChangeLog file being the wrong size.

At this point I decided it would be best if I just deleted the whole nvidia-settings directory and resynced.  I deleted /usr/portage/metadata/timestamp.chk and ran emerge --sync again.

Now when I run emerge -uva world, it reports that I can update from 180.22 to 180.27.  However, when I tell it to build, it complains again that the ChangeLog is the wrong filesize.

# emerge -uva world

These are the packages that would be merged, in order:

Calculating dependencies... done!
[ebuild     U ] media-video/nvidia-settings-180.27 [180.22] 0 kB

Total: 1 package (1 upgrade), Size of downloads: 0 kB

Would you like to merge these packages? [Yes/No] 

>>> Verifying ebuild manifests

!!! Digest verification failed:
!!! /usr/portage/media-video/nvidia-settings/ChangeLog
!!! Reason: Filesize does not match recorded size
!!! Got: 9988
!!! Expected: 9905

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge --sync
2. emerge -uva nvidia-settings

I'm getting "Missing digest for '/usr/portage/media-video/nvidia-settings/nvidia-settings-180.27.ebuild"

Same error here. It's pretty straightforward, the Manifest was not updated by the dev to include either the ebuild or tarball for 180.27. Still that way in CVS: http://sources.gentoo.org/viewcvs.py/gentoo-x86/media-video/nvidia-settings/

A temporary (and very ugly) fix for this is to:
ebuild /usr/portage/media-video/nvidia-settings/nvidia-settings-180.27.ebuild digest
This will overwrite the Manifest file with the correct values. Of course the next time you emerge --sync the Manifest file will be overwritten and you'll be stuck again until they fix the problem.

This looks like it's fixed
