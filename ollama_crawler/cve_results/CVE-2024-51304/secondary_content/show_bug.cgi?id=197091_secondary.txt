Description

I've come across this "problem" while trying to run a Gentoo system image as a Xen VM on a Debian host (using a prebuilt xen kernel from debian). It appears that the debian initrd mounts /proc and /sys, but /sbin/rc wants to mount those itself in the sysinit stage (and dies if it can't, for whatever reason). It should check to see if they're already mounted before doing this.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Copy a Gentoo system to a Debian Xen host
2. Set it up to use the debian xen kernel/initrd
3. Try to boot it

Actual Results:  
Init fails and prompts for root password for maintainance.

Expected Results:  
rc should see that /proc and /sys are already mounted, and go on about its business.

you didnt post `emerge --info` like the bug report page said to, so i'm going to assume you're using baselayout-1 since this should already be fixed in baselayout-2
