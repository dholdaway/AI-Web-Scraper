Description

Trying all weekend to get a MariaDB-galera cluster node to join cluster to no avail. Extensive debug logging turns out that client node at some point relies on 'lsof'-command, supplied by sys-process/lsof. So maybe lsof could be an ebuild dependancy?

Cheers!

The sst-rsync USE flag already does this.
