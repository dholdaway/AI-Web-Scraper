I can't reproduce.

What browser are you using?

I get the correct certs.

Server certificate
subject=/C=US/ST=New Mexico/L=Albuquerque/O=GENTOO Foundation, Inc./CN=wiki.gentoo.org
issuer=/O=CAcert Inc./OU=http://www.CAcert.org/CN=CAcert Class 3 Root

If you are using a browser that does not support SNI, then you're SOL.

after restarting my system the cert warning is gone away so this seems to be a problem on my side of the connection.
