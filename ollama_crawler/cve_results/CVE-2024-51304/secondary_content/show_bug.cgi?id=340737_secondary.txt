See attached build log.  Don't know if this is a problem with media-libs/flac not creating the libtool file or with media-sound/pulseaudio expecting one.

Reproducible: Always

sudo emerge -pqv media-libs/flac
[ebuild   R   ] media-libs/flac-1.2.1-r3  USE="cxx ogg sse -3dnow (-altivec) -debug -static-libs"
