Description

Microsoft updated intermediate certificates so there are SSL errors connecting to MSN messenger accounts. Please consider creating a -r bump to properly supply the new certificates as mentioned in http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/MSNCertIssue

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Connect to an MSN account in Pidgin.
Actual Results:  
More often than not you'll have an SSL connection issue.

Expected Results:  
The connection is successful and the certificate chain can be validated.

"Pidgin 2.7.6 fixes the MSN certificate issue and enables multiple MSN logins."
Source: http://www.pidgin.im

Will be solved for us in the next version bump.

For the record I bumped the ebuild in my local overlay but the fix wouldn't work with GNUtls. Once disabled (I have no idea why that USE was in my package.use), pidgin linked against NSS and everything seems fine now.
