EXHIBIT 99.1Quanex Building Products Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Results
Another Record Quarter for EarningsMargin Expansion Across All Operating SegmentsRepaid $40 Million in Bank Debt in QuarterBalance Sheet and Liquidity Remain StrongRecord Year for Cash Provided by Operating Activities HOUSTON, Dec.  14, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Quanex Building Products Corporation (NYSE:NX) (“Quanex” or the “Company”) today announced its results for the three months and twelve months ended October 31, 2023.                  The Company reported the following selected financial results:    Three Months Ended October 31, Twelve Months Ended October 31,($ in millions, except per share data)  2023  2022  2023  2022 Net Sales  $295.5  $307.5  $1,130.6  $1,221.5 Gross Margin  $80.0  $67.5  $277.5  $268.5 Gross Margin %  27.1%  21.9%  24.5%  22.0% Net Income  $27.4  $24.7  $82.5  $88.3 Diluted EPS  $0.83  $0.75  $2.50  $2.66           Adjusted Net Income  $31.2  $25.0  $90.9  $88.9 Adjusted Diluted EPS  $0.95  $0.75  $2.75  $2.68 Adjusted EBITDA  $50.8  $38.7  $159.6  $152.5 Adjusted EBITDA Margin %  17.2%  12.6%  14.1%  12.5%           Cash Provided by Operating Activities  $44.5  $48.1  $147.1  $98.0 Free Cash Flow  $29.6  $34.5  $109.7  $64.8  (See Non-GAAP Terminology Definitions and Disclaimers section, Non-GAAP Financial Measure Disclosure table, Selected Segment Data table and reconciliation tables for additional information) George Wilson, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We reported another record quarter for earnings and our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong. Despite pressure on revenue due to market volume softness related to ongoing macroeconomic challenges, and some pricing pressure as raw material costs declined, we converted very well and realized margin expansion across all operating segments in both the fourth quarter and the full year. Our continued focus on controlling what we can control helped drive our improved results and we believe we are hitting our stride from an operational standpoint. Overall, we are proud of what we were able to accomplish in 2023. “Managing working capital and generating cash is a core focus of ours, which enabled us to pay down our bank debt by $40 million during the fourth quarter alone. In fact, we generated record free cash flow in 2023.” (See Non-GAAP Terminology Definitions and Disclaimers section and Free Cash Flow reconciliation table for additional information) Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2023 Results Summary Quanex reported net sales of $295.5 million during the three months ended October 31, 2023, which represents a decrease of 3.9% compared to $307.5 million for the same period of 2022. The Company reported net sales of $1.13 billion during the twelve months ended October 31, 2023, which represents a decrease of 7.4% compared to $1.22 billion for the same period of 2022. The decreases were primarily attributable to softer market demand and lower pricing in North America. Quanex reported net sales growth of 1.3% for the fourth quarter of 2023 and a decline of 2.9% in net sales for the full year in its North American Fenestration segment. Excluding the contribution from the LMI Custom Mixing assets the Company acquired on November 1, 2022, net sales in the North American Fenestration segment would have declined by 10.7% for the fourth quarter and 13.9% for the full year. In its North American Cabinet Components segment, Quanex reported a decline of 23.7% in net sales for the fourth quarter and a decline of 21.9% in net sales for the full year. Excluding foreign exchange impact, the Company realized a decrease in net sales of 3.7% for the fourth quarter and a decrease of 2.8% in net sales for the full year in its European Fenestration segment. (See Sales Analysis table for additional information) The increase in adjusted earnings for the three months and twelve months ended October 31, 2023 was largely attributable to effective cost control, real price increases, a decline in raw material costs and a decrease in income tax expense. As such, Quanex was able to realize margin expansion in the fourth quarter and full year in each of its operating segments and on a consolidated basis. Balance Sheet Update As of October 31, 2023, Quanex had total debt of $70.0 million ($18.5 million excluding real-estate leases that are considered “finance” leases under U.S. GAAP) and the Company’s leverage ratio of Net Debt to LTM Adjusted EBITDA decreased to 0.1x (Net Debt free excluding these real-estate leases). As of October 31, 2023, Quanex’s LTM Adjusted EBITDA was $159.6 million and LTM Net Income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, was $82.5 million. (See Non-GAAP Terminology Definitions and Disclaimers section, Net Debt Reconciliation table and Last Twelve Months Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation table for additional information) Outlook Mr. Wilson stated, “We enter fiscal 2024 with a somewhat cautious outlook for the first half due to the ongoing macroeconomic challenges combined with typical seasonality in our business, but we are optimistic that demand for our products will improve in the second half as consumer confidence is restored over time. However, consistent with the last two years, based on current macro indicators, recent conversations with our customers, limited transparency, and varying opinions on the outlook for 2024, we are taking a thoughtful approach to guidance for 2024. As such, we believe it would be premature to give guidance at this time and intend to re-visit guidance for 2024 when we report earnings for the first quarter. Our long-term view continues to be optimistic as the underlying fundamentals for the residential housing market remain positive.” Conference Call and Webcast Information The Company has also scheduled a conference call for Friday, December 15, 2023 at 11:00 a.m. ET (10:00 a.m. CT) to discuss the release.

Non-GAAP Terminology Definitions and Disclaimers Adjusted Net Income (defined as net income further adjusted to exclude purchase price accounting inventory step-ups, transaction costs, certain severance charges, gain/loss on the sale of certain fixed assets, restructuring charges, asset impairment charges, other net adjustments related to foreign currency transaction gain/loss and effective tax rates reflecting impacts of adjustments on a with and without basis) and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that Quanex believes provide a consistent basis for comparison between periods and more accurately reflects operational performance, as they are not influenced by certain income or expense items not affecting ongoing operations. EBITDA (defined as net income or loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and other, net) and Adjusted EBITDA (defined as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude purchase price accounting inventory step-ups, transaction costs, certain severance charges, gain/loss on the sale of certain fixed assets, restructuring charges and asset impairment charges) are non-GAAP financial measures that the Company uses to measure operational performance and assist with financial decision-making. Net Debt is defined as total debt (outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility plus financial lease obligations) less cash and cash equivalents. The leverage ratio of Net Debt to LTM Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that the Company believes is useful to investors and financial analysts in evaluating Quanex’s leverage. In addition, with certain limited adjustments, this leverage ratio is the basis for a key covenant in the Company’s credit agreement. Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure calculated using cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Quanex uses the Free Cash Flow metric to measure operational and cash management performance and assist with financial decision-making. Free Cash Flow is measured before application of certain contractual commitments (including capital lease obligations), and accordingly is not a true measure of the Company’s residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Quanex believes Free Cash Flow is useful to investors in understanding and evaluating the Company’s financial and cash management performance. Quanex believes that the presented non-GAAP measures provide a consistent basis for comparison between periods and will assist investors in understanding the Company’s financial performance when comparing results to other investment opportunities. The presented non-GAAP measures may not be the same as those used by other companies. Quanex does not intend for this information to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Forward Looking Statements Statements that use the words “estimated,” “expect,” “could,” “should,” “believe,” “will,” “might,” or similar words reflecting future expectations or beliefs are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: impacts from public health issues (including pandemics, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic) on the economy and the demand for Quanex’s products, the Company’s future operating results, future financial condition, future uses of cash and other expenditures, expenses and tax rates, expectations relating to Quanex’s industry, and the Company’s future growth, including any guidance discussed in this press release.
