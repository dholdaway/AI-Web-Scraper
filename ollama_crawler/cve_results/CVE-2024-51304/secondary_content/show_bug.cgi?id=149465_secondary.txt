Description

Firstly, I do not understand why we have a spawn-fcgi package when spawn-fcgi is also installed with lighttpd. Both provide init scripts. Is this duplication intentional? The lighttpd ebuild mentions that it now includes spawn-fcgi so I'm guessing that the intention was to eventually get rid of the spawn-fcgi package. However, I think that packaging spawn-fcgi separately makes sense if it can be used with Apache as well. I haven't tried that but I think it can, right? If so, it should not be installed with lighttpd.

Secondly, if it is to be packaged separately, it should not depend on PHP in any way at all. spawn-fcgi is capable of launching any FastCGI application, not just PHP-based ones. I also use it to run Rails applications and Trac.

I have a new init script but I'll file a separate bug for that.

Well really not everyone wants to install lighttpd to get spawn-fcgi :)

Hey hey, wait a minute. That's what I'm saying, it *should* be packaged separately so it should *not* be provided by both packages. You should address the PHP dependency issue at least.

Uhm? It already is packaged separately for people that don't use lighttpd. lighttpd upstream uses its own bundled one and the ebuild blocks net-www/spawn-fcgi, I really don't see what's your issue here.

I dunno, I just doesn't seem very Gentoo-like to duplicate something like this unnecessarily. =P If it were me, I'd just have lighttpd depend on spawn-fcgi through the fastcgi USE flag. It's up to you, of course, but if my new init script is used, please ensure it is added to both packages.
