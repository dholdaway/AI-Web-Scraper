Hi,

for a long time there is a memory allocation bug in recode which sometimes causes the recoded result to have trailing garbage at its end. There is a patch from Debian (which can be downloaded from http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=156635) which solves the problem. Is it possible to involve this patch into the portage tree?

Thanks,
Vladimir Trebicky.
