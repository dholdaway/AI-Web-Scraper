Hi,

you're getting this template-based bug because the package in the subject hit a "header present but cannot be compiled" during ./configure execution. If you check my blog post in the URL, this is going to be a problem when autoconf-2.64 will be used so you should pay attention and consider fixing the issue (or let upstream know about it at least).

Thank you for your consideration. Share and enjoy!

app-emulation/fuse-0.10.0.2-r1:20090130-053520.log:configure: WARNING: X11/extensions/XShm.h: present but cannot be compiled

I autoreconf'd this with 2.64 and still couldn't reproduce(?)

The headers seem in question XShm.h seems to have been replaced/renamed divided up in recent xorg?  http://www.mail-archive.com/xorg-devel@lists.x.org/msg01095.html

Can't reproduce -> please attach a build.log if you still see the issue with fuse-0.10.0.2-r3.

Thanks.
