Description

I've created an ebuild for netatalk 2.0.3 and i was told in the gentoo forums to
post it on bugzilla to contribute it. I haven't changed a lot, i've taken my
time to read throught the whole 2.0.1 ebuild and the makefiles, everything sees
fine to me the way it's set up. So i've only changed the name and i also added
sys-libs/db as dependency, that was forgotten in the 2.0.1 ebuild.

Netatalk 2.0.3 runns for over 2 weeks now and i moved all my data from the old
servers. So i copied around 300GB to netatalk 2.0.3. Afp works perfectly for me,
haven't played around with printing yet.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
2.
3.




Don't know if anything is needed, but i'm willing to provide information about
my systems and settup if necessary.
