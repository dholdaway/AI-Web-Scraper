configure: error: You need either libswresample
                                                   or libavresample.

!!! Please attach the following file when seeking support:
!!! /var/tmp/portage/media-tv/xbmc-12.2-r1/work/xbmc-12.2/config.log
 * ERROR: media-tv/xbmc-12.2-r1::gentoo failed (configure phase):
 *   econf failed

You probably need a minimum virtual/ffmpeg version higher tan now.

ok, but libav isn't listed as a possible dep in xbmc-12.2 ...

most likely it's been fixed in 13.0_p2, and the focus really is on moving forward in the xbmc world ...
