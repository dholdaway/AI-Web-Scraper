ark need the rar commandline tool to support rar files and the zip commandline tool to support zip.

Those tools shuld be in RDEPEND for ark

maybe it also is a good idea to add the following packages to RDEPEND as well:
app-arch/tar
app-arch/gzip
app-arch/bzip2

I'm sure I have missed some.

Atached patch vill add app-arch/rar and app-arch/zip to RDEPEND (if rar or zip is in USE).

What if I don't want rar and zip support?

you add USE-flags:

IUSE="zip rar"

RDEPEND="${RDEPEND}
zip? ( app-arch/zip )
rar? ( app-arch/rar )"

Yeah.  However, my point is that it seems complex to add a bunch of use flags for RDEPENDs that are easily satisfied by just emerging the actual application.  Now, if they were compile time DEPENDs I would understand, but it's a quick and easy fix to add {zip,rar,gzip,bzip2} support.  I'm not sure that the addition of use flags and RDEPENDs gains us much.

Gah... Just stick some elog info in postinst and be done with it. Adding deps that don't affect the result in any way is not what use flags are for.

I concur that adding these optional runtime dependencies plus defining extra local use flags, is a bit too much. While I don't mind adding einfo, I'd even say it's too unimportant for elog, isn't it?!
