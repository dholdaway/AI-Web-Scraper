I realize, since I go to kde-base/kde*3.4-meta packages that
- no more system sound were played (with "regular" packages, it worked)
- my PC was suddenly very slow to stop (trying to play logout system sound, artsd did not stop immediately, taking 1 minute or so) using "turn off computer" in KDE GUI.

All system sounds are in ogg format... and trying to play them using "artsplay' did... nothing. No error, no sound, simply nothing (MP3, WAV: OK).

After investigations. I think a package from kde-multimedia-3.4-meta is missing from build system that shold be named: "artsplugin-oggvorbis".

Try installing akode ebuild, that should fix.

This is not an x86 only problem!
I had the same problem on my amd64, KDE was extremely slow to log out.

Merging akode solved the problem!

For me, there is something missing somewhere, an ebuild dependency ? I choose
manually the kde packages to merge and KDE was configured AND installed with
.ogg files. If both the ogg files are present, the ogg files are used in system
sounds, and arts installed, I consider akode should be installed wirt arts...

I hope I am a little bit clear in my explanation.
