I suggest to rename dev-java/jython to dev-lang/jython for consistency with another implementation (dev-lang/python) of Python language.

It would be sufficient to rename 2.5 slot (and future newer slots).

I don't feel there's much benefit to be gained from this. What's the point?

We also have dev-java/jruby and dev-python/pypy in tree, so dev-java/jython looks consistent to me.

Majority of Ruby implementations are in dev-lang category (dev-lang/ruby, dev-lang/ruby-enterprise, dev-lang/rubinius). An exception (dev-java/jruby) should be treated as a bug.

dev-python/pypy should be renamed to dev-lang/pypy as it was discussed in #gentoo-python on 2012-06-03. (This bug is not for any discussion about PyPy.)

There is neither such a bug for jruby nor pypy currently. Are there other language implementations which you think should be changed?

Just going to close this. Feel free to raise this on a mailing list.
