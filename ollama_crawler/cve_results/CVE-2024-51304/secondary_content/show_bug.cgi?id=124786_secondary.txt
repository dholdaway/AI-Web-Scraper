As per the summary, when you set the fuse useflag it doesn't install it as a dep so ntfsprogs fails due to lacking fuse.

Probably because fuse is included in recent kernels.

Indeed. With sys-fs/fuse you just get the utils, not the modules with recent kernels (and that's correct).

Ah, my bad, I'll check my kernel configuration.
