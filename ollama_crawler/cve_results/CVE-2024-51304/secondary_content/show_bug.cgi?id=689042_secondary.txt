this seems like this age old boost::re_detail_107000::cpp_regex_traits issue. This is very likely an ABI issue (similar to wx and its dreadful reliance on GCC ABI) where boost and the revdep were built with different GCC versions. Could you try compiling boost 1.70 and the consuming package with the same GCC version?

Gnucash is built with gcc since the build fails with clang as the compiler, boost does build with clang. Rebuilt boost-1.70.0 using gcc as compiler and then gnucash-3.5 builds properly.

Rebuilding boost (and all bdeps several times) didn't work to solve this for me.

I don't know what was wrong and why, but gnucash was successfully compiled now :D
Sorry.

I've been building Gnucash against Boost 1.72 for sometime now. I've never been able to reproduce the issue, and the reporter seems to have fixed it as a matter of course.
