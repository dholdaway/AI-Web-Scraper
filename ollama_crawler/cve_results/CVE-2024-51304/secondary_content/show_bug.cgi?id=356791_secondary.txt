Description

Mirror gentoo.mirror.dkm.cz seems to be unreachable with IPv6, on any of these protocols:
icmp, http, ftp, rsync

The mirror is however marked as being IPv6 accessible: http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/mirrors2.xml

IPv6 address resolves OK:

$ host gentoo.mirror.dkm.cz
gentoo.mirror.dkm.cz is an alias for krtecek.dkm.cz.
krtecek.dkm.cz has address 86.49.49.49
krtecek.dkm.cz has IPv6 address 2001:470:1f0b:13d2::49

IPv4 accessibility is also ok.

Also, muni.cz is now IPv6 accessible (which is what emerge generally defaults to when other Czech mirrors fail) despite not being marked as such.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add http://gentoo.mirror.dkm.cz/pub/gentoo/ as your first mirror in /etc/make.conf
2. Ensure you have functional IPv6 connectivity.
3. Try to emerge something (or run emerge --sync) - it will take a very long time before timeouting.



Expected Results:  
Ran emerge operation, instead it timeouts.

Hello guys, 
I cannot see what the problem might be. The ipv6 is working OK. The only problem there was a filtered icmp (tracert/ping), but TCP services such as rsync/http/ftp were and are working fine. I can see them up from http://www.subnetonline.com/pages/ipv6-network-tools/online-ipv6-port-scanner.php and I can see traffic on ip 2001:470:1f0b:13d2::49 port 80 flowing without problems. Can you please doublecheck? 

Thanks,

Tomas

Hello,

first off, my apologies for posting this bug multiple times. After posting the bug, the URl was post_bug.cgi, which I didn't notice at first, so every time I refreshed the page, my browser posted the bug again.

On the bug note - I am using 6to4 connection and I read somewhere that some services tend to filter 6to4 traffic. Is it possible that this might be the case?
If not, which steps should I take to ensure that my connection is working properly (because now it seems it is)?

Try a known working service like http://ipv6.google.com. Look at the output from traceroute or mtr (more useful) to see if there is a routing issue.

I've also confirmed that the mirror is fine on ipv6.

http://ipv6.google.com works just fine for me (and any other IPv6 test I found on the Internet seems to be OK too).

Here is the result of "mtr gentoo.mirror.dkm.cz" from my router box:
