11:23 <+hkBst> 2008beta seems to contain sys-apps/pciutils-2.2.3-r? for amd64.
Any reason why it doesn't contain 2.2.10 or wasn't that stable yet? It adds the
-k flag to lspci to view which driver is actually being used.
11:52 <+armin76> hkBst: 2.2.10 wasn't in beta1 snapshot
11:53 <+armin76> the ebuild wasn't there, i mean
11:53 <+armin76> and it isn't either in beta2

It's actually the stable version for most arches.. might as well stable the rest?
