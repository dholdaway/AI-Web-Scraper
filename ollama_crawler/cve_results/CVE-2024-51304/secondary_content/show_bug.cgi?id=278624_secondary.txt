Occasionally, when skipping to the next song on my playlist, Audacious will segfault.  It seems to be random; I've seen it happen the first or second time I skip to the next song, and I've skipped through 50-75 songs without it happening (although Murphy dictates that that the latter case occurs when I've got it hooked up to GDB to capture a backtrace).

I've only been able to reproduce this while running Audacious the way I normally use it.  That is, I have my usual "all my songs" playlist loaded, with roughly 5000 songs.  I have the main window, the equalizer window, and the playlist window open.  The plylist window displays about 40 entries.  I have shuffle on.  I've tried to change a couple of these parameters (small playlist, not shuffle, not playing while skipping), but not had any luck reproducing the issue in that case.

I have captured a couple of backtraces when this happens; I'll attach them next, along with my "emerge --info" output.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Start audacious
2) Open the playlist window
3) Load a large playlist
4) Turn on shuffle
5) Start playing
6) Skip to the next track
7) Repeat 6 until the error occurs.

I believe this to be fixed in media-sound/audacious-2.1; this will be your new stable on any architecture except Sparc. Should you be on Sparc, please test 2.1 and if that fixes it; comment on bug #279238. Thank you.
