Description


David Roman





          2021-09-11 11:10:19 UTC
        

gentoo-kernel fails to apply the configuration. In the logs the next message appears: unpack kernel-x86_64-fedora.config.5.13.9: file format not recognized. Ignoring.

Other symptoms are that if I use savedconfig or confid.d directory to try to enable I2C_HID_ACPI the generated kernel have that setting disabled (and many others). In fact it seems it doesn't apply any configuration at all.

This happens with gentoo-kernel-5.13.15 and 5.13.14 (I didn't tested more)

Reproducible: Always

The message from unpack can be safely ignored. That just means unpack did not recognize it as a know archive format, which makes sense because it is a plain text file rather than an archive.

As well, I have verified that the fedora config is getting applied.

I don't know what a "confid.d" directory is.

savedconfig definitely works for me.

You should probably seek help in a Gentoo support channel.
