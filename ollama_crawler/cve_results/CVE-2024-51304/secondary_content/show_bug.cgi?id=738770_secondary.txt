Created attachment 656392 [details]
build.log.xz

build log and emerge --info (compressed because it exceeds attachment limit, use 'xzless' to read it)

fwiw, I saw this as well, but it felt to be caused by changes elsewhere in the stack, bceause 1.26.0 I'm pretty sure didn't fail before, but now 1.26.0 appeared affected the same in my testing too

Not hitting it anymore when building 1.26.4 or 1.26.6; maybe some temporary glitch in the system
