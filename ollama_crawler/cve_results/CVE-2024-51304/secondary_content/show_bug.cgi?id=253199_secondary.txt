Possibly the default branch format has changed and now when I issue a bzr init the following error occurs.

Needs at least Python2.5 or Python2.4 with the pysqlite2 module
bzr: ERROR: missing sqlite library

Compiling python with +sqlite fixes the problem.

I'm 99% sure that the default branch format has not changed in bzr since version 1.0 or so.  Searching for "sqlite" in the source of bzr returns no results. Perhaps you have an (old/broken) installation of bzr-svn installed, which does use SQLite?

No need, I fixed it in revision 191.  Even referenced this bug.
