I have a couple of issues to report concerning xchat-gnome-0.16.  The first is application and menu icons.  These menu icon does not appear.  I've had the issue previously with xchat-gnome. It seemed to have been resolved (with 0.15?) but has returned with 0.16.

The second issue has to do, I think, with the plugins.  I have a few python plugins that work fine with xchat and older versions of xchat-gnome.  However with  0.16 xchat starts with the following error appearing in the conversation window:

--
Python xchat_print called without a valid context.
 xchat_print called without a valid context.
 xchat_print called without a valid context.
 xchat_print called without a valid context.
 xchat_print called without a valid context.
 xchat_print called without a valid context.
 xchat_print called without a valid context. 
--

This may have been an API change, but if such a change occurred it is not in the release notes.  The plugins appear to function normally, however, and I assume the error is generated by the plugins calling xchat.prnt when it is loaded.  Is the behavior no longer allowed?

I'm closing this as the application icon has returned and I don't think anyone has an interest in fixing the second problem.
