evolution-2.32.2 fails to sync contacts with gmail because of libgdata-0.8.0. With libgdata-0.6.* evolution works well. Talking in #evolution chan, they said to me that libgdata-0.8.0 works well with evolution-3

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
Unable to open address book

This address book cannot be opened.  This either means that an incorrect URI was entered, or the server is unreachable.

Detailed error message: Cannot authenticate user: A required property of a <entry/gContact:website> element (@rel) was not present.


dev-libs/libgdata-0.6.4  USE="gnome -debug -doc"
mail-client/evolution-2.32.2  USE="crypt gstreamer ldap networkmanager python ssl (-clutter) -doc -kerberos"
