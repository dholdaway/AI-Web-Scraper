We can't really guess. What soundcard do you have? Which driver are you using
and is it from kernel or from alsa ebuilds (and which version)? Also, the
description of the problem is not really clear (for me at least).

I'm using the SoundBlaster Live! 24bit, with the kernel-compiled alsa. It just
makes noise whenever I press a key, or something moves on the screen, or I move
the mouse. I don't know how to explain it better.

Hmm, sound more like interference/IRQ issues. Did you try to move it to another
slot? Also, please post the output of 'cat /proc/interrupts'.

I'll try moving it to a different slot. By the way, I would just like to thank
you guys for being so quick to respond and always having an answer. Companies
should model customer support off you guys.

I tried using another PCI slot to no avail.

I seemed to have fixed it, and I was able to work with sound for a while, but
now when I want to listen to music or whatnot the program I'm using simply
repeats a second of the song over and over. This happens with every program.
Whenever I press a button, the program freezes. Any advice?

Sorry, I forgot to say what I did. I turned off SPDIF Out.

The problem seems to solve itself... I tried using Totem as root, but the same
thing happened. I was previously using Totem as admin (my user). Then I tried
another media player, xmms. It worked fine as root, but I couldn't get it to add
in admin. I rebooted, and everything worked. This is still a bug though, as
Totem doesn't function correctly.

If the problem remains with totem, open a bug for totem.
