Description

The command line options for agetty in /etc/inittab seem to be out of order.  I noticed this when trying to get a serial console working.

The man page for agetty says it should be "agetty port baud_rate,...  [term]".

In the inittab file the baud_rate is before the port. "/sbin/agetty 9600 ttyS0 vt100"

It should be "/sbin/agetty ttyS0 9600 vt100"

Reproducible: Always

both work fine.  from the agetty source:
    /* Accept "tty", "baudrate tty", and "tty baudrate". */

considering this is how many people have invoked it over many years, i'd rather not change something that is working fine
