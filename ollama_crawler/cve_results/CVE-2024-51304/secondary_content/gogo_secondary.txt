However, our Directors’ and Officers’ insurance does provide coverage for certain of these losses.



 Other - Other   Highlight
In some instances, we could reasonably use different accounting estimates, and in some instances actual results could differ significantly from our estimates.

 Revenue - Geography   Highlight

 Financial - Income   Highlight
We account for the valuation allowance on our deferred income tax assets in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”).
