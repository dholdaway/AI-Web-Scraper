Some clicks in chrome/chromium, make X session to crash. It is mostly related to clicks that open new windows, e.g. Chrome Store.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Chrome
2. Click 'New tab'
3. Click 'Chrome Store'
Actual Results:  
X session crashes.

Expected Results:  
No crash.

From .xsession-errors:

[24224:24224:0602/211312:ERROR:chrome_browser_main_x11.cc(62)] X IO error received (X server probably went away)
[24512:24512:0602/211312:ERROR:x11_util.cc(117)] X IO error received (X server probably went away)
[13149:13149:0602/211312:ERROR:x11_util.cc(117)] X IO error received (X server probably went away)
[16:16:0602/211312:ERROR:command_buffer_proxy_impl.cc(153)] Could not send GpuCommandBufferMsg_Initialize.

I have already tried with same error:
google-chrome-27.0.1453.93_p200836
google-chrome-28.0.1500.29_beta202781
chromium-27.0.1453.93

I disabled some startup apps. This is the full ~/.xsession-errors. First line corresponds to i3 window manager. The rest to chrome:

Eduardo, please obtain the stack trace of crashing X server (http://wiki.x.org/wiki/Development/Documentation/ServerDebugging).

Possibly related bug #458166 .

Also post emerge --info.

As I was rebuilding X with symbols, it was upgraded from:
x11-base/xorg-server-1.13.1
to
x11-base/xorg-server-1.13.4.

The crash has gone. :-o
