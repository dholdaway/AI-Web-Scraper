 Inside Samsara Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Expense   Highlight
For example, our business and results of operations could be affected by global macroeconomic trends and events such as inflationary pressure, interest rate increases and declines in consumer confidence, widespread disruptions of supply chains and freight and shipping channels, increased prices for many goods and services (including fluctuating fuel costs), labor shortages, delayed or reduced spending on IT products, and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets, as well as other conditions arising from international conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, geopolitical tensions involving China, and the conflict in Israel and Gaza, uncertainty around the outcome of political elections, and the emergence of pandemics and epidemics.



 Other - Other   Highlight
If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
We also have foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses and foreign currency transaction gains and losses.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
We expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future to support our growth and because of additional costs associated with legal, accounting, compliance, insurance, investor relations, and other areas associated with being a public company.
