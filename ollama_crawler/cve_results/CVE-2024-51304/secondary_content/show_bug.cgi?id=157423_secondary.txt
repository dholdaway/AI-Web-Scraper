Description

On several occasions, I have posted bug reports after having searched the database for keywords I thought would be in other bugs of the same issue, only to have the bug marked as a duplicate soon after posting.

One such bug is bug #175319, which I posted shortly after bug #157292, of which it was marked a duplicate. I did search both the quicksearch and the advanced search and found no listing of bug #157292, so I proceeded with submission.

Some time later, I noticed bug #157299, which also did not appear in any search results and was probably created in a similar manner to my bug #157319

I am puzzled at this. I suppose a lot of duplicate bugs are created because of this. Whether it is merely a user error or an actual bug in the search engine, it should be addressed in some way.

Searching for 'ALL dhcpcd mask' gives:

The search I ran before submitting bug #157319 was 'ALL dhcpcd' which only returned 1 bug, something about keyword removals.  The same search now returns 129 results. Interesting...
