EXHIBIT 99.1EARNINGS   RELEASEFor Immediate ReleaseAnalyst Inquiries:                                                      Media Inquiries:Mike Eliason                                                           Laurie Dippold  (317) 249-4559                                                            (317) 468-3900mike.eliason@openlane.com                                           laurie.dippold@openlane.com    OPENLANE, Inc. Reports 2023 Financial ResultsCarmel, IN, February 20, 2024 — OPENLANE, Inc. (NYSE: KAR), today reported its fourth quarter and annual financial results for the period ended December 31, 2023. "Our business made significant progress in 2023, and we are very pleased to deliver results that exceeded our guidance for the year," said Peter Kelly, CEO of OPENLANE. "We are beginning to see the positive impacts of our strategic investments in innovation and technology, our brand simplification work, as well as our continued diligence around costs. Our solid execution in the fourth quarter and throughout 2023 delivered volume growth, revenue growth and margin expansion, results that I believe position OPENLANE for future growth and success."2023 Financial Highlights•Total revenue of $1,645 million, an increase of 8%•Loss from continuing operations of $155 million, including a $251 million non-cash impairment•Adjusted EBITDA of $272 million, an increase of 18%, with Marketplace contributing approximately 40%•Marketplace volumes increased 3% and 10% in the fourth quarter•$237 million of cash flow from operating activities2024 GuidanceAnnualGuidanceIncome from continuing operations (in millions)$74 - $88Adjusted EBITDA (in millions)$285 - $305Income from continuing operations per share - diluted *$0.20 - $0.30Operating adjusted net income from continuing operations per share - diluted$0.77 - $0.87* The company uses the two-class method of calculating income from continuing operations per diluted share. Under the two-class method, income from continuing operations is adjusted for dividends and undistributed earnings (losses) to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, and the weighted average diluted shares do not assume conversion of the preferred shares to common shares.Earnings guidance does not contemplate future items such as business development activities, strategic developments (such as restructurings, spin-offs or dispositions of assets or investments), contingent purchase price adjustments, significant expenses related to litigation, tax adjustments and changes in applicable laws and regulations (including significant accounting and tax matters) and intangible impairments. The timing and amounts of these items are highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a potential size that could have a substantial impact on the company’s reported results for any given period. Prospective quantification of these items is generally not practicable. Operating adjusted net income from continuing operations per share excludes amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets, as well as one-time charges, net of taxes. See reconciliations of the company's guidance included below.The following information was filed by Kar Auction Services, Inc. (KAR) on Tuesday, February 20, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.
