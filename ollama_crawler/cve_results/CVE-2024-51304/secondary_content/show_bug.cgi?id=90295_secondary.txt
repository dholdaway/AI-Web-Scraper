Description

Since I can ever rememeber running k3b outside of KDE desktop results in the configure dialogue being significantly higher than the available screen hieght.

This makes it all but unusable since I either cant resize it or cant displace it depending on where it falls. 

Since k3b is popular with non KDE users as well could reasonably safe defaults be used where, what I assume is a kde parameter is not detected?
 Screen size? Font height?


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.start xfce4
2.run k3b
3.try configure k3b

Actual Results:  
The dlg comes up with either the top or the Accept / Cancel buttons off the 
screen.


I observe this on 1024x768.

Can't reproduce this behaviour on fluxbox.


xfce herd: Can you?

Thanks Brad. Can't fine a bug report upstream either. Looks like a local problem.
