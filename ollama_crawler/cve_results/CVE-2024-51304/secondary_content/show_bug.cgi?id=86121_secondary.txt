Description

I get this block error if I do emerge -puvD world

These are the packages that I would merge, in order:

Calculating world dependencies ...done!
[blocks B     ] >=net-www/apache-1.3.33-r2 (is blocking net-www/mod_ssl-2.8.21)

Total size of downloads: 0 kB

There is problem in mod_ssl-2.8.21.ebuild in DEPEND, where the line !>=net-www/apache-1.3.33-r2 blocks apache-2.X.X instalation (I have both apache-1 and apache-2 installed). Can anyone update DEPEND string of mod_ssl-2.8.21.ebuild  to probably

&& (!>=net-www/apache-1.3.33-r2 <net-www/apache-2) or somethink like this?

After emerge sync now it's OK.

Reopening because of Bug 89325.

Apache herd, please clarify this. I believe that net-www/mod_ssl-2.8.22 requires ~arch apache-1 versions now (Bug 86052). If this is the case, it would probably be useful to clarify what Apache version you need to use with whatever mod_ssl version and note this _clearly_ in ChangeLog as well. This whole apache refresh stuff is is a real mess... :-(

stable apache (1.3.33-r1) requires mod_ssl-2.8.22 which is stable as well
testing apache (1.3.33-r2) requires mod_ssl-2.8.22-r1 which is testing as well

i can't reproduce this, please reopen if it still exists after syncing

Benedict, this bug is about 2.8.21 (also see your comment http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86052#c12). That one states now states DEPEND="=net-www/apache-1.3.32*" so the bug is now fixed. 

Anyway:

2.8.22-r1 is in ~arch for virtually everything and inherits apache-module, so should work correctly with new apache-1. 

2.8.22 is only stable on x86. I just emerged sync to verify. And states DEPEND="=net-www/apache1.3.33*" I really fail to recognize how will this work with apache-1.3.33-r2 since both -r1 and r2 apache ebuild state 2.8.22 only, not 2.8.22-r1)

ChangeLog says:

 09 Apr 2005; Benedikt Boehm <hollow@gentoo.org> mod_ssl-2.8.21.ebuild,
  mod_ssl-2.8.22.ebuild, +mod_ssl-2.8.22-r1.ebuild:
  fixed dependency issues: moved 2.8.22 to 2.8.22-r1, fixed deps in 2.8.21
  and moved 2.8.21 to 2.8.22 to support 1.3.33-r1, see bug #86052

You see, not a single word about 1.3.33-r2. This is anything, but clear. The users have to be immensely confused about what is going on here. There is a lot of people in the forums pissed off about what

Leaving this closed as the actual bug _is_ now fixed, but I just had to comment. :-(

> 2.8.22-r1 is in ~arch for virtually everything and inherits apache-module, so should work correctly with new apache-1.

right, wrt bug #4315, it is currently not possible to specify AND dependencies, so we have to use '=net-www/apache-1*', though this shouldn't cause any problems as long as you don't mix ARCH and ~ARCH

> 2.8.22 is only stable on x86. I just emerged sync to verify. And states DEPEND="=net-www/apache1.3.33*" I really fail to recognize how will this work with apache-1.3.33-r2 since both -r1 and r2 apache ebuild state 2.8.22 only, not 2.8.22-r1)

the current 1.3.33-r2 ebuild has 'ssl? ( =net-www/mod_ssl-2.8.22-r1 )' in PDEPEND, 1.3.33-r1 has 'ssl? ( =net-www/mod_ssl-2.8.22-r1 )', so portage should choose the right mod_ssl package for your apache version if your keyword settings are correct.

correction:

[...] 1.3.33-r1 has 'ssl? ( =net-www/mod_ssl-2.8.22 )' [...]

OK, thanks very much. Hope this helps other people who have problems to sort out this one. Just wondering how long will this apache refresh related mess continue. *Sigh*
