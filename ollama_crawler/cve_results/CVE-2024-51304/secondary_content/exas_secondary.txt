 Inside Exact Sciences Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
A change in the assumptions made for probability of success, projected fiscal year of payment, and present-value factor could have a material impact on the estimated fair value.



 M & A - Other   Highlight
As a result, the actual results may differ from the assumptions and judgments used to determine fair value of the assets acquired, which could result in material impairment charges in the future.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Finally, should we later determine the judgments underlying estimated collections change, our financial results could be negatively impacted in future quarters.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
The decrease in facility and support services was due to fewer costs incurred on commercial related information technology projects.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
We have recorded a valuation against our deferred tax assets based on our history of losses and current uncertainty as to timing of future taxable income.
