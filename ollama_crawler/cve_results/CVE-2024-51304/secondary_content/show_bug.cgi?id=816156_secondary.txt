Hm. I can't reproduce, compiles fine for me.

I cannot see any error output from the compiler in the log. It just looks fine until emerge suddelny reports an error. Could this be something on the CI machine interrupting the build?

There was an error (search for FAILED:), but there's no useful log I can see from it. If I were to guess it's probably related to new llvm/clang:13 libraries being present even though intel-graphics-compiler should be using clang:11 (other packages seemingly broke because of that like dev-lang/ispc despite set to use 12) but I haven't tried to reproduce.

Gave it a try, but yeah -- can't reproduce either. Either it's something already side-fixed (might be given a few quickfix to llvm stack) -- or it needs more precise ordering/USE to reproduce.

Guess could just ignore it this time around and see if it comes back.

Yes, I also tend to close in this case. Let's see, if that happens again.
