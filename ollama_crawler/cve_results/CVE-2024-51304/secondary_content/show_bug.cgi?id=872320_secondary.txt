Issue: dev-ruby/ruby-gio2-3.4.3 fails tests (lto).
Discovered on: amd64 (internal ref: lto_tinderbox)

NOTE:
This machine uses lto with CFLAGS=-flto -Werror=odr -Werror=lto-type-mismatch -Werror=strict-aliasing

Here is a bit of explanation:

-Werror=lto-type-mismatch:
User to find possible runtime issues in packages. It likely means the package is unsafe to build & use with LTO.
For projects using the same identifier but with different types across different files, they must be fixed to be consistent across the codebase.

-Werror=odr:
Used to find possible runtime issues in packages. These bugs are a problem anyway but may be even worse when combined with LTO. C++ code must comply with the One Definition Rule (ODR) - see https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/definition#One_Definition_Rule.

-Werror=strict-aliasing:
Used to find possible runtime issues in packages. These bugs are a problem anyway but may be even worse when combined with LTO.

Workarounds:
- If upstream is friendly and still active, file a bug upstream. For emulators, codecs, games, or multimedia packages, it may be worth just applying a workaround instead, as upstreams sometimes aren't receptive to these bugs (VALID FOR ALL).
- Use the new 'filter-lto' from flag-o-matic.eclass as it's likely to be unsafe with LTO (VALID FOR lto-type-mismatch - odr).
- Fix it yourself if interested, of course (VALID FOR ALL).
- Append-flags -fno-strict-aliasing (VALID FOR strict-aliasing).
- Use memcpy() but a union is sometimes suitable too (VALID FOR strict-aliasing).
- -fstrict-aliasing is implied by -O2, so this must be addressed in some form (VALID FOR strict-aliasing).

Could be related to https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18062. 

Does this happen with ruby31 or even better, ruby32?

Tried building ruby-gio2 4.1.2 (with ruby31). Tests passed fine:



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
91 tests, 121 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 pendings, 0 omissions, 0 notifications
100% passed
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
118.33 tests/s, 157.34 assertions/s
>>> Completed testing dev-ruby/ruby-gio2-4.1.2


This includes LTO for ruby31 itself too.
