I installed eclipse-sdk-3.0.1 first, and afterwards I tried eclipse-sdk-3.0.2,
but both gave me the same error message on startup. I will include the error log
as an attachment.
The relevant error is the last one, I think, which is the following:
!ENTRY org.eclipse.osgi May 18, 2005 12:44:48.941
!MESSAGE Startup error
!STACK 1
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Bundle
initial@reference:file:/usr/lib/eclipse-3/plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime_3.0.2/

        at org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.main(Main.java:688)

Does anyone have an idea what could be wrong or what I could try to fix it?
Thanks for any hints.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. start eclipse by typing eclipse-3 in a terminal (or any other starting method)
2. wait for crash (exception) (about 2 or 3 seconds maybe)

Actual Results:  
an exception breaks the startup process.

Expected Results:  
startup properly

Does this also happen with the eclipse builds from eclipse.org?

I think I already tried that some time ago and it didn't work then.
But to be sure, I just tried it again with version 3.0.2 from eclipse.org and I
get exactly the same errors in the error log.

I'm not sure if the problem could have anything to do with my jre:
sun-j2sdk-1.4.2 (it's the version from source, installed through emerge)

But the jre/j2sdk didn't made any problems yet. Eclipse 2.1.3 works fine (using
the same jre).

I got the same error. I run /home on nfs mount and tought that was the problem.
I changed to nfs version 3 to enable file locking, but that didn't help.
I tried blackdown vm and sun vm but no difference.

I have reiserfs 3.6 partitions for /, /usr and /home.

I have no eclipse/nfs interaction (only some portage dirs are nfs-mounted) but 
it works just fine here.  Sorry...

If you have tried different versions of eclipse then running with the parameter
-clean can help by removing old cruft from $HOME/.eclipse

You could also try totall removing the $HOME/.eclipse directory and see if that
helps.

I recently tried it again. And it suddenly started without any problems (and it
seems to work perfectly).
I don't know exactly what it caused to work (I didn't even reemerge it).

There are several things I did recently:

- updated system (I also changed to the 2005.0 profile)
- switched from KDE to Gnome
- switched from source based sun j2sdk 1.4.2 to the blackdown-jdk 1.4.2.02
