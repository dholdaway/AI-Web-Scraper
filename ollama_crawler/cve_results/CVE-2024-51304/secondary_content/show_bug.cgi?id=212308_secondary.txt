What version of app-arch/rpm are you using? Also please post whole emerge --info just in case

the issue was last seen on the 4.4.6 ebuilds.  if you can d/l any of those RPMs and `rpm -q` works on the .rpm file (using rpm-4.x ebuilds), then feel free to close the report.  this issue was pointed out to me by someone else.

Closing this bug since I can't reproduce at all with rpm-4.4.6-r7 and not enough info is available
