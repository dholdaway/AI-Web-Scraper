When looking at my ~xsession-errors log file this warning appears for mail-notification :

** (mail-notification:2813): WARNING **: rufus-azrael@pop.numericable.fr : impossible de démarrer l'authentification SASL : SASL(-4): no mechanism available: No worthy mechs found

Reproducible: Always

OK, so it checked if it could use SASL and then gracefully failed and used a different authentication method.

For what it is worth, if I start mail-notification as my usual user in a terminal I get these messages in the termainal.  If I start it in a root window, I don't get these messages.  There must be something that root has access to that my usual user does not.  I'm hoping that getting this fixed will keep mail-notification from failing to work after it has been active for awhile.
