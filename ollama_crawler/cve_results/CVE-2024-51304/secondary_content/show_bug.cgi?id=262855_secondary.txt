Description

Booting into GDM from a fresh reboot and, after I've logged into GDM, it takes an enormous amount of time to log out of GDM and get back to the login prompt.  I followed the Gnome-Light installation under the Gentoo manual and have had several problems with my Gentoo build.  I've fixed all but this one.  This one being it takes too long to log in/out of GDM.  Too long as in about 3+ minutes.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Reboot System and when GDM starts to load
2. or, after GDM has finally loaded, log in and then log out
Actual Results:  
Either option will take a while before you get a login prompt to show up, a long time as in 3+ minutes


Expected Results:  
It should take only a reasonable amount of time to load - less than 30 seconds

This may help determin my problem...

which version of gdm and gnome-session are you using ? Also you might want to attach ~/.xsession-errors, look for error message in you syslog or in /var/log/gdm/ and also attach emerge --info.

Looks like I've got a few problems, but one of the major ones seems to be with my video card driver.  I don't get it.  I've got an ATI Radeon video card.

I tried something different....

I took the following steps

CODE: nano -w /etc/portage/package.keywords (created this file)
x11-libs/libdrm

CODE: nano -w /etc/X11/xorg.conf (changed the driver from "fglrx" to "radeon"
Identifier     "Card0"
Driver         "radeon"
VendorName     "ATI Technologies Inc"
BoradName      "RV280 [Radeon 9200 PRO]
BusID          "PCI:1:0:0"

CODE: emerge -uav libdrm

GDM still loads very slowly.......

So I did the following.......
CODE: nano -w /etc/X11/xorg.conf (changed the driver from "radeon" to "vesa")
Identifier     "Card0"
Driver         "vesa"
VendorName     "ATI Technologies Inc"
BoradName      "RV280 [Radeon 9200 PRO]
BusID          "PCI:1:0:0"

FINALLY, GDM loads quickly....
I know this doesn't actually fix my problem, but for now it is a work around.
I think there is something wrong with the ATI/Radeon driver.... Maybe someone here can offer some advice.  Thanks!

Found the problem with this issue, but I'm not experienced enough to fix it.

I've been speaking with Walt in several emails.  He says the ATI drivers haven't been worked on since Sept 2008 and that it isn't compatible with the latest Gentoo kernel.

Ultimatly, a bug should be filed against 8.501.  To get around this issue, I did add a line to my package.keyword file, but this did not fix the problem.  We need to complie a new ATI driver that is compatible with the latest Gentoo kernel.

Walt says, "Sept 2008 was the last time anyone looked at it, and the linux kernel changes faster than that."

"The Changelog shows a lot of attention being paid to 8.542, including
the fix for one of the errors we see with 8.501, so I'd suggest adding
a line for ati-drivers to your /etc/portage/package.keyword file so
you can build the ~x86 versions, which are more likely to build."

"Of course a bug should be filed against 8.501, but I suspect that the
~x86 versions will be stable before the bug report gets any attention."

Someone please let me know if this driver gets fixed.  Thanks!

I wasn't ever able to get this working.  I'm positive it was due to a lack of up-to-date ATI drivers for that version of the Gentoo kernel; which at the time, was the latest version of the kernel.  I basically gave up on getting the problem fixed and moved on to something else.  The vesa drivers seemed to work ok for anyone else attempting this.  Perhaps in a newer kernel, the ATI drivers may work, but I haven't tried it.  It's a lot of work just to find out it's not going to work.

The computer I was using when I got this error was a laptop.  Since then, I've determined Gentoo is best suited for a server environment and not necessarily for a workstation/laptop.  If I want a workstation build, I'll just have to use another distro.  Gentoo is very secure and stable when doing what it does best.  so to me, it works best as a server.

At some point I'll probably test it again on a VM, but not on my laptop until these types of problems get worked out.

Good luck!
