Motor Carrier Size and WeightWelcome to Motor Carrier Size and Weight



Motor Carrier Size and Weight is new to the Office of Maintenance. Senate Bill 2000 appropriated the move of Motor Carrier Compliance July 1st, 2011 from the Florida Department of Transportation to the Department of Highway Safety and the Florida
            Highway Patrol. The weigh stations and their operations will remain under FDOT. Motor Carrier Size and Weight is staffed by regulatory weight inspectors. MCSAW assists FDOT in fulfilling its mission of providing a safe transportation system
            by performing commercial vehicle size and weight enforcement. The primary purpose of the MCSAW weight enforcement program is to protect Florida's highway system and bridges from damage from overweight vehicles. Vehicles are weighed at its
            20 fixed weigh station locations and mobile enforcement with portable scales statewide. Over 20 million vehicles are weighed annually.In Partnership WithFlorida Department of Highway Safety and Motor VehiclesFlorida Department of AgricultureFlorida Highway PatrolFederal Motor Carrier Safety AdministrationFlorida Trucking AssociationU.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration
