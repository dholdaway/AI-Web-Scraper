Ok, I didn't sync my portage tree for a few days and only searched in bugzilla for the new version. Sorry for that.

In my proposed ebuild, I removed the eclasses and the function src_compile(), since they aren't necessary and I changed the description a little bit, so it mentions Exim.
pfqueue can handle the Exim mail queue, too.
