The wrong hash was still the same. After deletion, the file was always downloaded/saved badly. The difference was one letter in the file. I don't know why it was wrong on my disk. If you want to compare, this is the file that was generated on my disk http://dpaste.com/2M6TCQ6

Solution:
1. Backup and delete /usr/portage
2. emerge-webrsync
3. emerge --sync
