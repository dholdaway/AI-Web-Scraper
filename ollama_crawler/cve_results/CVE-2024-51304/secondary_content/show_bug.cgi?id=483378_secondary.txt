emerge --info

I upgraded linux-headers-3.7 to version 3.9 and all my configured bridges using module* iproute2 complained to start: "module not found".

*) i.e. modules_br1="iproute2"

Downgrading to linux-headers-3.7 and issue is gone.

does iproute2-3.9.0 or iproute2-3.11.0 work ?

While using kernel 3.12.x I was using linux-headers-3.12 and iproute2-3.12.0 which worked perfectly.

Since switch to kernel 3.13.x, I am using linux-headers-3.13 and iproute2-3.12.0 which works perfectly, too.

I am not sure anymore which version of iproute2 solved my issue, since it's too long ago.

On the other head, I suggest to use matching iproute2 and linux-headers version to the kernel versions.
