Description

Hello. I just emerged 2.0.54-r5. (using the new httpd.conf) 
 
I added APACHE2_OPTS="-D SSL" to /etc/conf.d/apache2, and restarted apache.  
 
http://localhost works fine, but not https://localhost. I get broken 
connection in konqueror. 
 
While trying to sort out the problem i added: 
LoadModule ssl_module    modules/mod_ssl.so 
right after the <IfDefine SSL>.. <IfDefine> in 40_mod_ssl.conf, and restarted 
apache. 
 
It then said: 
 * Restarting apache2... 
[Sat Jun 04 14:05:06 2005] [warn] module ssl_module is already loaded, 
skipping   
 
I can now connect to https://localhost 
Strange eh? 
 
The config files wern't touched apart from this. 
 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add APACHE2_OPTS="-D SSL" to /etc/conf.d/apache2    
2. Start apache2, discover that connecting to https://localhost doesn't work    
3. Add  LoadModule ssl_module    modules/mod_ssl.so to 40_mod_ssl.conf (RIGHT  
after  <IfDefine SSL>.. <IfDefine> 
4. Restart apache, and get the warning: [warn] module ssl_module is already 
loaded, skipping 
5. Discover that connecting to https://localhost now works fine

Expected Results:
