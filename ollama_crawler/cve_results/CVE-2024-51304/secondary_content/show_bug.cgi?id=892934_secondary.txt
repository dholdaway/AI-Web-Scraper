I have my ssh public key in guru overlay, but it turns out that pushing commits to dev branch requires my GPG signing key's fingerprint.

I just created a ECC ED25519 gpg key with a signing subkey.

The fingerprint is 8C371809644FB2F1C23630D3BA4925D9470A4BDA

Is this enough?

You need to sign commits but we don't verify which key they were signed with, or store key fingerprints at the moment.  That said, thanks for giving it to us, it'll be easier to find it should we ever need it.

Okay.
