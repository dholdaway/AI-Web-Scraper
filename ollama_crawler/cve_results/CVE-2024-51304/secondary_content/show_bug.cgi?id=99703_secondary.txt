Description


Stig Mogensen





          2005-07-20 10:47:03 UTC
        

I upgraded to the new stable baselayout-1.1.13 from the previous stable version.
Ran etc-update as requested, and now I can't boot. Whenever a script is starting
up, say alsasound, bootmisc, or clock, I get the errors;

Command not found2
Command not found6
Command not found8
Command not found11
Command not found13
Command not found18
Command not found38
Command not found40 

This is happens also, if I run
/etc/init.d/alsasoun stop
and
/etc.initd./alsasound stop

or any other bootscript.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. It happens on boot - every time
2. It happens on shutdown - every time
3. It happens on /etc/init.d/<bootscript> start and /etc/init.d/<bootscript> stop

sounds like maybe an error in one of your config files

if you run `depscan.sh` do you get the error ?

Yes.....depscan.sh fills up my screen with "Command not found2, Command not
found6, ..." and so on.

Edit /sbin/runscript.sh, add an ' -x' to the end of the first line
(#!/bin/bash), and then start/stop something that fails, and attach the output here.

Did that. I don't think it did much good though. Here's what happened;

/etc/init.d/ntpd stop
: invalid option
Usage: /bin/bash [GNU long option] [option]...
       /bin/bash [GNU long option] [scriptfile]
GNU long options:

and so it continues, with a list of options.

Same error. But more fatal.....nothing in Gentoo works, with an andded '-x' in
depscan.sh

so edit depscan.sh and put this on the 2nd line:
set -x
