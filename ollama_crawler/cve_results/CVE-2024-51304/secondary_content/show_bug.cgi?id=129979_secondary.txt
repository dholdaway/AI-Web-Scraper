I noticed (thanks to nightmorph) that there is missing information. We'll ask the user about it and update the patch accordingly before commiting.

Do not commit yet, please. The user has been using <grub-0.96. Maybe using a new version of grub solves the issue as well.

It's been a while, if there was a bug, it was probably already fixed upstream. Closing. Feel free to reopen if you still think that it's needed.
