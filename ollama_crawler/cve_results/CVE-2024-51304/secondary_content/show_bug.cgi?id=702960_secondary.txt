Looks like you should rebuild dev-lang/R.

Unsure what kde proj is supposed to do here.

After rebuild dev-lang/R it installed without any error.
Maybe it is missing a rebuild in another ebuild dependency?

The preseved-libs feature should have handled it.  If you meet this bug again in the future, feel free to reopen it.
