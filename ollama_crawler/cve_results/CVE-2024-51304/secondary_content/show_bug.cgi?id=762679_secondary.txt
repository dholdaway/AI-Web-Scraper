"size" is provided by sys-devel/binutils which is part of the system set.

sys-devel/binutils-config has the native-symlink IUSE

*shrug* Which is enabled by default. Also "size" is only used at the end of the install phase to output some statistics, so it will make no difference for the installed package if the command isn't found.

I don't think that this is worth the effort of patching the build system. Please report upstream if you care enough.

My task here is to report something that has not been noted before. If you think that it is invalid is fine for me.

However, if we do changes like introduce sys-devel/binutils-config[-native-symlinks] it is a nonsense go to upstream and say: "hey, in gentoo we dropped size, so please fix that". The response will be: you are on your own.

So, my personal thought is: if we introduce these changes we should support that and not just say "go to upstream"

By that logic, if fixing it upstream makes no sense, then fixing it downstream doesn't make sense either. In any case, there's no breakage but only a warning (and we could even delete the size command from the Makefile entirely without causing problems).

Leaving this bug open, because I see that the Makefile in the upstream repo has a SIZE variable now: https://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/qemacs/qemacs/Makefile?r1=1.98&r2=1.99
Which means that it will be trivial to suppress the warning, e.g. by passing SIZE=true to emake.

BTW, toolchain-funcs.eclass doesn't have a tc-getSIZE() and tc-getPROG() is not documented.
