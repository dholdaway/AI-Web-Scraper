I have ascertained that such a bump will require @ minimum UglifyJS and possibly the wrapper package yuglify.  It's not clear at this point whether it /they ought be RDEPS to Djblets itself or to django-pipeline, between the two I'd say django-pipeline which carries the uglifyjs python module.  The missing exe file uglifyjs calls node which is delivered by net-libs/nodejs. There are yet more prospective deps required also absent from portage, though nodejs is in portage.  I have verified by my own testing, cross checked with chris@camisa.org AND @ #django.

euscan now reports Djblets latest @ -0.8.5. and it also has a sec bug requiring a 0.8 version.  The new deps are not pythonic but rather javascript, therefore they are outside my realm.  The ebuilds in neurogeek's overlay pf this and other deps make for curious reading.   To install them, he wrote his own eclass!

I don't have the time / need to handle this package in a approriate manner (no longer using reviewboard), so I walk off on this package. I'll update metadata.xml accordingly.
