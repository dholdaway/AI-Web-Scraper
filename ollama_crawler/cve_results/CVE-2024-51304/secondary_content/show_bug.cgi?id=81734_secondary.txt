Which version of libmore are you using?
Also, please provide the output of `emerge --info`
and `ldd /usr/bin/mbconv`.

libmoe-1.5.6 doesn't even compile on my machine :(
I've just marked 1.5.8 stable on x86, and as 1.5.8 doesn't show 
the problem you reported, I close this bug as WORKSFORME.
Please reopen this bug if 1.5.8 doesn't work as expected.
