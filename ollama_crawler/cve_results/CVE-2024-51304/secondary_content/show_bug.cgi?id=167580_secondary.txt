$ zynaddsubfx
zynaddsubfx: error while loading shared libraries: libresmgr.so.0.9.8: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Yes ... I did re-emerge it. It compiles and links fine. For what it's worth, the USE flags were "alsa jack oss". 

BTW, there is a package called "resmgr" but it's masked because of a security issue. Could zynaddsubfx be looking for "resmgr"??

$ emerge -pv resmgr

These are the packages that would be merged, in order:

Calculating dependencies -
!!! All ebuilds that could satisfy "resmgr" have been masked.
!!! One of the following masked packages is required to complete your request:
- sys-apps/resmgr-1.0 (masked by: package.mask)
# Stefan Cornelius <dercorny@gentoo.org> (27 May 2006)
# Masked because of security bug #131866

Never mind ... looks like only one machine of three is broken. Close it as "unable to reproduce" or "worksforme".
