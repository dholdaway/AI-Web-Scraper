While emerging dev-lang/erlang-14.2.1, it failed to locate shared zlib in the configuration phase.

I guess the following lines should be included in the src_prepare() or src_configure() to reproduce the configure script.


cd "${S}"
./otp_build autoconf

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge =dev-lang/erlang-14.2.1
Actual Results:  
configure: error: cannot find any shared zlib

...

 * ERROR: dev-lang/erlang-14.2.1 failed (configure phase):
 *   econf failed

I emerged dev-lang/erlang-14.2.2 successfully, does that still yield in the problem you reported for 14.2.1 for you?

I tried to emerge dev-lang/erlang-14.2.2, but it failed with the same reason.
It could also be emerged with the same solution.

14.2.3 has an empty zlib argument for as far as I can see (in configure) so I think if this ever was an issue, it should be obsolete now.
