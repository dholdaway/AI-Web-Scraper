Description

When I run the "date" command on the terminal, it shows the correct date, time and time zone (ADT). However in gnome 40, the time at the top of the screen is in the wrong time zone (UTC-0). I tried to fix this in gnome-control-center, but when I click the anywhere on time-zone map, it shows the correct time zone for that location for a split-second, then switches it to UTC-0 (anywhere I click on the map).

I should mention that I've installed gnome-base/gnome-light, not the full gnome-base/gnome

interestingly, it works when I run gnome-control-center as root (with sudo), but it isn't applied to my normal user. So it is probably something to do with permissions

Missing emerge --info, primarily don't know if this is systemd (localed) or openrc (openrc-settingsd)

Sorry. It's openrc.

the problem was bad permissions on /etc/timezone. doing "sudo ls -l /etc/timezone" returned "-rw------- 1 root root 16 Sep 15 14:16 /etc/timezone", so I just used chmod to give myself read permissions.

I don't know why my /etc/timezone had weird permissions, but I think this was a system-specific issue.
