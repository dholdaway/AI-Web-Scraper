When a file is downloaded, the download manager is unable to open the file - and unable to open the containing folder.
In both cases this is shown in the console when trying: 
Error: Couldn't open file 'file://[PATH TO FILE'

USE flags are: "dbus java startup-notification xulrunner" (I tried adding gnome use-flag aswell - as suggested elsewhere. But that didn't make any difference)

I'm running XFCE as desktop environment.

I tried linking /usr/bin/Thunar to /usr/bin/nautilus as suggested elsewhere - but that didnt make any difference.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download file using firefox 3.0.8
2. Try to open the file using the download manager

emerge --info please

Have you tried backing up ~/.mozilla/ and confirming the issue?

I tried removing .mozilla
When clicking "Open containing folder" I then askes me for an application (I
choose /usr/bin/thunar here).
That now seems to work.

Now I wonder how that got broken in the first place - and how it should be
properly fixed?

Deleting users .mozilla is NOT the right option.

Ok, here's what I did to fix it.

1. start firefox
2. Edit -> Preferences -> Applications
3. Find Content-Type: "file"
4. Remove (the broken in my case?) application "thunar"
5. Replace with another application (in my case /usr/bin/Thunar)

Maybe at some point firefox needs a full path to the application - where as it didn't before?

This is an OLD installation - going back to atleast firefox 2.0.0.7.
But, I guess it might be worth mentioning somewhere - if other people are having problems with "Open containing folder"?

But did you also try adding the gnome USE-flag to xulrunner?

No, I didn't try that.
Sadly since i fixed it (post #3) I cannot reproduce this bug...
