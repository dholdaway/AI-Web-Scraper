/bin/bash: warning: setlocale: LC_ALL: cannot change locale (et_EE.UTF-8 UTF-8)

export ceased

Try fixing whatever causes your system to output these first. Doesn't seem like an issue with tagsoup ebuilds.

Can say we agree it's not related to the tagsoup ebuild.
For what it's worth, I managed to emerge the other package which has a similar trouble.
I don't expect to sort the export ceased issue as such, but the package emerged before I made changes to locale settings.  Once locale settings were changed, the package.env went missing from the package cited as missing when re-emerging it.  Despite changing locale settings back to what they were, it won't revert & re-emerge.

I can retry this since I have a tarball of the system before making any changes which can re-establish.  I shall tinker a little more but pretty sure don't know enough to pin it properly.
So this will apply to the other three.
