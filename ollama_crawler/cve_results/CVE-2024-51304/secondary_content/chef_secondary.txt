On a pro-rated basis, comparing 13-week to 13-week basis, net sales increased 29.3%.•GAAP net income was $16.0 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $1.2 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2022.•Adjusted net income per share1 was $0.47 for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $0.46 for the fourth quarter of 2022.•Adjusted EBITDA1 was $59.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $50.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2022.“Business activity coming out of September strengthened into the fourth quarter as seasonal customer demand and volume trends progressed through November and December to close-out 2023. Price inflation continued to moderate, and our Chefs’ Warehouse Teams across our North American and International Markets delivered strong organic growth and margin improvement”, said Christopher Pappas, Chairman and Chief Executive of the Company. “As we move into 2024, I would like to thank all our CW teammates for the dedication and passion they have for our mission - to discover and deliver the finest specialty foods, fresh produce, and center-of-plate proteins that inspire the culinary creativity and feed the success of our customer and supplier partners, as we strive for excellence and impeccable service.”Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2023 ResultsNet sales on a reported basis, 13 weeks compared to 14 weeks, increased 20.1% to $950.5 million from $791.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The incremental 53rd week of the fiscal year ended December 30, 2022 negatively impacted the year-on-year growth by approximately 9.2%. The growth in net sales was the result of an increase in organic sales of approximately 11.3% as well as the contribution of sales from acquisitions, which added approximately 18.0% to sales growth for the quarter, partially offset by the impact of the 53rd week. Organic case count increased approximately 11.3% in the Company’s specialty category with unique customers and placement increases at 12.4% and 6.5% respectively, compared to the prior year quarter. Organic pounds sold in the Company’s center-of-the-plate category increased approximately 8.4% compared to the prior year quarter.

Gross profit margins increased approximately 38 basis points to 24.1%.

 Inside Chefs' Warehouse, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
A sudden and unexpected change in consumer preferences or change in overall economic conditions could result in a significant change to these adjustments that could require a corresponding charge to earnings.



 Revenue - Product   Highlight
In addition, product cost inflation may negatively impact consumer discretionary spending decisions within our customers’ establishments, which could adversely impact our sales.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
In particular, product cost inflation and deflation impacts our results of operations and, depending on the amount of inflation or deflation, such impact may be material.

 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
As of December 29, 2023 and December 30, 2022, we had valuation allowances of $2.1 million and $1.6 million, respectively, relating to certain net operating losses that may not be realizable in the future based on taxable income forecasts and certain state net operating loss limitations.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Prolonged periods of product cost inflation may have a negative impact on our profit margins and results of operations to the extent we are unable to pass on all or a portion of such product cost increases to our customers.
