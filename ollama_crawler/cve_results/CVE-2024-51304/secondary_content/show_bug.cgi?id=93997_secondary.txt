Description

When you run kaffeine for the first time (after emerging it, version 0.6-r1), 
it does a little sanity check, and reports that the kaffeine_part was not 
installed correctly. 
 
If you click next, you can get a few more details, it says 
kaffeine_part.desktop not found. 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge kaffeine version 0.6-r1 
2. run kaffeine, which will load the first-start wizard. 
3. First start wizard reports the problem. 
 
Actual Results:  
Not having the kpart installed correctly will probably reduce functionality.   
The file kaffeine_part.desktop is copied 
to /usr/share/services/kaffeine_part.desktop, which might be correct on other 
distros, but isn't correct for gentoo. 

Expected Results:  
The file should have been installed 
here: /usr/kde/3.4/share/services/kaffeine_part.desktop  
  

if you copy the file manually as root: 
cp /usr/share/services/kaffeine_part.desktop /usr/kde/3.4/share/services/kaffeine_part.desktop 
 
and then delete kaffeine's first-run data: 
rm -R ~/.kde/share/apps/kaffeine 
 
When you run kaffeine again, the problem has been fixed. Its just a little 
problem with the ebuild.

That shouldn't be a problem, as /usr prefix is always checked while it's in 
$KDEDIRS. 
 
Please post your emerge info and the output of "echo $KDEDIRS" ?

bash-2.05b$ echo $KDEDIRS 
/usr 
 
However, I don't think that was the problem anymore, because I found that even  
though the startup wizard said everything was A-Ok, kaffeine still wasn't 
behaving.   
  
I've found that the config file ~/.kde/share/config/kaffeinerc had left the 
entry: 
 
[Player Part] 
Last Service Desktop Name= 
  
Changing that to: 
 
[Player Part] 
Last Service Desktop Name=kaffeine_part 
 
has fixed the problem. I don't know why the entry was left empty like that, 
when I ran kaffeine as the root user the proper entry was created. I think what 
happened is that blank entry caused it to look for '.desktop' which didn't 
exist anywhere.

So this seems to be ok as for new users works fine.
