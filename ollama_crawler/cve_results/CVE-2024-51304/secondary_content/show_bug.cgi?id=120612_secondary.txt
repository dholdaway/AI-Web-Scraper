Might have just been a one time thing. Looks fine to me.

jforman@sixthstreet ~/gentoo $ cat rpt.rsync1.uk.gentoo.org
IP: rsync1.uk.gentoo.org
Checked at (UTC)   Timestamp
================================================
     22:10:58   Sat, 28 Jan 2006 21:51:01 +0000
jforman@sixthstreet ~/gentoo $ hostx rsync1.uk.gentoo.org
rsync1.uk.gentoo.org    A       62.197.40.130


Also keep an eye on
