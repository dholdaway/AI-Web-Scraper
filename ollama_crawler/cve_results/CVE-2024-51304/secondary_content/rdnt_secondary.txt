 Inside Radnet, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
The Securities and Exchange Commission defines critical accounting estimates as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.



 Other - Other   Highlight
We assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Revenue under capitation arrangements is recognized in the period in which we are obligated to provide services to plan enrollees under contracts with various health plans.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Similar to the prior year, growth in procedure volumes precipitated increases in salary expenses to meet additional professional staffing needs and we increased salaries as we seek to retain our skilled work force in the current tight labor market.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
We operate in a capital intensive, high fixed-cost industry that requires significant amounts of capital to fund operations.
