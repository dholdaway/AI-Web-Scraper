Description

While emerging gcc-4.0.0beta-20050409 or gcc-3.4.3.20050110-r2 the merge stops when trying to link to libunwind. This lib is available in ~ia64 but I think gcc should complain if libunwind is not installed before launching the merge.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:

Actual Results:  
gcc-4.0.0beta-20050409 or gcc-3.4.3.20050110-r2 can not compile properly if
libunwind is not installed.

gcc-3.4.3.20050110-r2 works just fine for me on ia64 w/out libunwind installed ...

Could you paste your binutils, glibc, libstdc++ version please ?

sys-devel/binutils-2.16.90.0.1
sys-libs/glibc-2.3.4.20041102-r1

libstd is not compiled yet and I gonna upgrade glibc after libstdc++ is installed.

gcc-4 and gcc-3.4.3.20050110-r2 compiled but switching to gcc-3.4.3 doesn't work cleanly. I got the error :

 * Switching to ia64-unknown-linux-gnu-3.4.3-20050110 compiler...
cp: `//lib/../lib64/': specified destination directory does not exist
Try `cp --help' for more information.
cp: `//lib/../lib64/': specified destination directory does not exist
Try `cp --help' for more information.                                     [ ok ]

libunwind was necessary to achieve compilation of those packages.

This bug has been pending for a long time and I have no more boxes to reproduce this. What shall we do ?
