Description

          2014-11-08 19:34:28 UTC
        

ownclods desktop client got an update yesterday, so I bumped the ebuild.

since 1.7 adds nautilus integration, we should consider a "nautilus" use-flag, and ignore /usr/share/nautilus-python/extensions/syncstate.py with a patch on CMakeLists.txt#157 or shell_integration/CMakeLists.txt

I am also not able to get any emblem in nautilus. The syncstatus.py-script reaches Line 129 but no icon is shown. If I replace 'emblem' by another string, e.g. "dropbox-uptodate" or "rabbitvcs-normal" its working. I.e. nautilus can't find the correct icon-location for "ownCloud_*"

I also tried to use the attached patch to fix this, but I had no luck.

Can anyone confirm this?

Reproducible: Always

I really don't know why, but It's working since today ... I've done nothing :/

One of the announcement messages mentioned that owncloud-client needed to be started before nautilus, maybe you got this behaviour and logging out/in "solved" it?

Anyway, yes the 1.7.0 will probably have a nautilus use-flag, at least to pull nautilus-python in (as the binding is python). This will have to wait until next week though as I am away for a few days
