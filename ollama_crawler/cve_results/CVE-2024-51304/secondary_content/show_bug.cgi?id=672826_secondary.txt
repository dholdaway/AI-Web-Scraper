I would like to request to add code formatting on wiki for articles like playonlinux (https://wiki.gentoo.org/index.php?title=Playonlinux&diff=752047&oldid=752020) to share informations about syntaxes, etc..

You should look at the CodeBox template which already has this support

Why can't we use something like:

```LANG
CODE
```

It seems to make it easier to provide codeblocks in articles + there is a plugin to mediawiki which adds this functionality afaik.
