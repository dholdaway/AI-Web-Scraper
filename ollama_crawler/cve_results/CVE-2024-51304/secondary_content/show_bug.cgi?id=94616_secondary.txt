was trying to get an updated gzip ebuild i committed last nite but 
after a sync it was nowhere to be found :(

$ rm -f timestamp
$ rsync -q rsync://65.19.163.230/gentoo-portage/metadata/timestamp .
$ cat timestamp
Tue May 31 00:08:26 UTC 2005
$ date --utc
Tue May 31 12:59:31 UTC 2005

using rsync.gentoo.org as my mirror

Rsync mirrors use timestamp.chk, which seems to be only a 1/2 hour behind.

# cat timestamp.chk 
Tue, 31 May 2005 13:02:01 +0000

[pjp@pc2 pts/14]~/.admin
# date -uR
Tue, 31 May 2005 13:49:45 +0000

regardless, the timestamp file reflects the age of the tree ... the server was
missing gzip-1.3.5-r7.ebuild among many others

just checked again and it looks like it's fixed itself ... the timestamp is now
reporting 12:37:07
