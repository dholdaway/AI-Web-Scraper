Some packages are providing the USE-flag «static» currently. But why not adding
it globally. An example eclass providing such a USE-flag would look like the
following:
==== snip =====
if use static
do
   CFLAGS="${CFLAGS} -static"
   CXXFLAGS="${CXXFLAGS -static"
done
IUSE="${IUSE} static"
=== snap =====

That's all.

$ euse -i static
global use flags (searching: static)
************************************************************

[-    ] static - !!do not set this during bootstrap!! Causes binaries to be
statically linked instead of dynamically

local use flags (searching: static)
************************************************************
no matching entries found

Hmm. Don't actually know what are you suggesting then, packages would choose to
inherit the eclass or not, which does not differ in any way from the current
situation. Besides, some packages are known to break when compiled statically.

Closing WORKSFORME, if you disagree, then explain in more detail, please.
