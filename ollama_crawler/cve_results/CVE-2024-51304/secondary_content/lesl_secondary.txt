Exhibit 99.1
 
Leslie’s, Inc. Announces Fourth Quarter & Fiscal 2023 Financial Results; 
Provides Fiscal 2024 Outlook
 
•Sales of $432.4 million in the fourth quarter and $1,451.2 million in Fiscal 2023
•Net income of $16.5 million in the fourth quarter and $27.2 million in Fiscal 2023
•Adjusted EBITDA of $59.5 million in the fourth quarter and $168.1 million in Fiscal 2023
•Diluted earnings per share of $0.09 in the fourth quarter and $0.15 in Fiscal 2023
•Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.14 in the fourth quarter and $0.28 in Fiscal 2023
 
PHOENIX, November 28, 2023 – Leslie’s, Inc. (“Leslie’s”, “we”, “our” or “its”; NASDAQ: LESL), the largest and most trusted direct-to-consumer brand in the U.S. pool and spa care industry, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and Fiscal 2023. 
 
Mike Egeck, Chief Executive Officer said, “Following three years of unprecedented growth, the pool industry and Leslie’s faced multiple transitory headwinds in 2023 that impacted our financial results through the fiscal fourth quarter. Despite these impacts, we continued to deliver exceptional service to our customers. In 2023, brand awareness, in stock service levels and corresponding net promoter scores were at all-time highs. In addition, our Pool Perks® loyalty program grew, customer lifetime value increased and we continued to gain market share, all of which are a testament to the focus and execution of our team members.”
 
Mr. Egeck continued, “Looking forward, the fundamental advantages of the after-market pool-care industry remain intact, as do our competitive advantages. Leslie’s remains the largest specialty retailer in the industry with unmatched capabilities and clear long-term growth opportunities, which along with our focus on executing against our strategic initiatives, position us to drive financial performance and create shareholder value as industry conditions normalize.” 
Fourth Quarter Highlights
•Sales decreased 9.1% to $432.4 million compared to $475.6 million in the prior year period. Comparable sales decreased 11.0% compared to the prior year period. Non-comparable sales including acquisitions and new stores contributed $8.8 million in sales for the period.
•Gross profit decreased 26.3% to $160.2 million from $217.2 million in the prior year period. Gross margin was 37.0% compared to 45.7% in the prior year period.  The decrease in gross profit was driven by the full quarter impact of decreased retail chemical pricing actions taken in June 2023, adjustments associated with year-end physical inventory count results, expensing of capitalized distribution costs associated with the reduction of inventory, lower product rebates, and occupancy deleverage associated with the decrease in comparable sales.
•Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) decreased 9.3% to $121.6 million from $134.1 million in the prior year period, driven by lower sales, expense management actions and lower

 Inside Leslie's, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Revenue - Product   Highlight
The key non-GAAP measures and other operating measures we use are comparable sales, comparable sales growth, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (loss), and Adjusted earnings per share.



 Financial - Expense   Highlight
The decrease in other expenses was primarily related to a $9.2 million non-cash loss on debt extinguishment related to the refinancing of the Term Loan and repayment of our senior unsecured notes during fiscal 2021, a decrease in interest expense of $4.2 million in fiscal 2022 due to the repayment of our senior unsecured notes with the proceeds of our IPO and $2.0 million of follow-on offering costs incurred in fiscal 2021.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest (including amortization of debt issuance costs), taxes, depreciation and amortization, management fees, equity-based compensation expense, loss (gain) on debt extinguishment, loss (gain) on asset and contract dispositions, executive transition costs, severance, costs related to equity offerings, strategic project costs, merger and acquisition costs, and other non-recurring, non-cash or discrete items.

 M & A - Other   Highlight
Based on our growth plans, we believe our cash and cash equivalents position, net cash provided by operating activities and borrowing availability under our Revolving Credit Facility will be adequate to finance our working capital requirements, planned capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, and debt service over the next 12 months.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
Adjusted net income (loss) is defined as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude management fees, equity-based compensation expense, loss (gain) on debt extinguishment, loss (gain) on asset and contract dispositions, executive transition costs, severance, costs related to equity offerings, strategic project costs, merger and acquisition costs, and other non-recurring, non-cash, or discrete items.
