Thanks for your report.

I cannot reproduce this here though, which versions of automake do you have installed?

Perhaps the real question should be "which version of automake-wrapper do you have installed ?".

IIRC, recently in the eclass and/or in the wrapper chages were made that were supposed to help with similar problems.

So 1.11.6 is the *only* automake version you have installed?

I now also tried with automake-wrapper 7 (had 8 previously), same result:
Still, I cannot reproduce the problem. Neither on ~amd64 nor on amd64

Maybe there is something borked in your system?
Can anybody else confirm the problem?

Well, I just synced portage and the issue went away

Ok, thanks for the feedback and great that it works for you now whatever that was ;-)

Closing.
