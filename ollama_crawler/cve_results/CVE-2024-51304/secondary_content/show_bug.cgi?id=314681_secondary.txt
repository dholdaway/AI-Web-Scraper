Description

After upgrading to kernel 2.6.33 I tried to start vmware-server, which didn't work.  Running 'emerge --one-short vmware-modules' was suggested, but that didn't help.
Running 'vmware-config.pl' also fails.

Problems occurred with vmware-server-1.0.8.126538. After upgrading to 
vmware-server-2.0.2.203138, there was no change in problems encountered

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1./etc/init.d/vmware-server start -- doesn't work
2. emerge -1 vmware-modules --- worked fine
3.vmware-config.pl -- complains that vmware isn't stopped even though there's no vmware running.

Actual Results:  
###  /etc/init.d/vmware start ###
 *   VMware Server is installed, but it has not been (correctly) configured
 *   for the running kernel.
 *   Please ensure that the modules have been compiled for this kernel:
 *   emerge --oneshot vmware-modules
 *   Also ensure VMware Server has been configured:
 *   /opt/vmware/server/bin/vmware-config.pl.
 * VMware is not properly configured! See above.
 * ERROR: vmware failed to start

### vmware-config.pl ###
root@osage relson # /opt/vmware/server/bin/vmware-config.pl
Making sure services for VMware Server are stopped.

 * WARNING: vmware is already stopped
Unable to stop services for VMware Server

Execution aborted.

Maybe it would be helpfull to add this info (--skip-stop-start) to einfo, avoiding confusing users?
