“Our strong 2023 results demonstrate that Freshpet has reached an inflection point: The significant investments we have made to create scale and extend our first mover advantage have begun to generate improved profitability and significant operating cash flow. That is the promise of the Fresh Future plan we announced last year, and it is working," commented Billy Cyr, Freshpet's Chief Executive Officer. "In 2024, we intend to continue making strong margin improvement and demonstrate continued capital discipline, while sustaining the net sales growth that Freshpet has become known for —further driving profitability and creating significant shareholder value. We believe the future of pet food is fresh and Freshpet is well positioned to drive growth and deliver the profitability one would expect from our leadership position."
 
Fourth Quarter 2023 
 
Net sales increased 29.9% to $215.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $165.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by volume gains of 25%.
 
Gross profit was $74.6 million, or 34.6% as a percentage of net sales, for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $45.7 million, or 27.6% as a percentage of net sales, for the prior year period. The increase in reported gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to improved leverage on plant expenses and reduced quality costs, partially offset by depreciation expense associated with the Company's capacity expansion and cost related to the disposal of equipment. For the fourth quarter of 2023, Adjusted Gross Profit was $88.5 million, or 41.1% as a percentage of net sales, compared to $54.8 million, or 33.0% as a percentage of net sales, in the prior year period. Adjusted Gross Profit is a non-GAAP financial measure defined under "Non-GAAP Measures" and is reconciled to gross profit in the financial tables that accompany this release. 
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) were $59.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $47.8 million for the prior year period. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A decreased to 27.7% for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to 28.8% for the prior year period. The decrease of 110 basis points in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was mainly a result of reduced logistics cost as a percentage of net sales, decreased cost related to the ERP implementation, and increased leverage on depreciation and share-based compensation as the business scales, partially offset by increased media spend and variable compensation accrual. Adjusted SG&A for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $57.2 million, or 26.6% as a percentage of net sales, compared to $37.2 million, or 22.4% as a percentage of net sales, for the prior year period. Adjusted SG&A is a non-GAAP financial measure defined under "Non-GAAP Measures" and is reconciled to SG&A in the financial tables that accompany this release.
 
Net income was $15.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to net loss of $2.9 million for the prior year period. The improvement in net income was due to contribution from higher sales, increased gross margin, and reduced logistics costs as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by increased SG&A including increased media spend of $10.4 million.
 
1 Adjusted EBITDA, as well as certain other measures in this release, is a non-GAAP financial measure. See "Non-GAAP Measures" for how we define these measures and the financial tables that accompany this release for reconciliations of these measures to the closest comparable U.S. GAAP measures.
