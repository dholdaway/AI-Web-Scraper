(NASDAQ: EYPT), a company committed to developing and commercializing therapeutics to improve the lives of patients with serious retinal diseases, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, and highlighted recent corporate developments.
“2023 was an exceptional year of execution and results for EyePoint Pharmaceuticals. The highlights include positive data from our Phase 2 DAVIO 2 trial of EYP-1901 in wet AMD, the continued advancement of our ongoing Phase 2 trials in NPDR and DME and the strengthening of our balance sheet with a $230 million oversubscribed financing in December along with the sale of rights to YUTIQ® for $82.5 million plus future royalties last May,” said Jay Duker, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of EyePoint Pharmaceuticals. “The DAVIO 2 clinical trial for EYP-1901 achieved all primary and secondary endpoints, highlighting its potential to become a paradigm-altering maintenance treatment for patients with wet AMD. We look forward to discussing our Phase 3 plans with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at a planned end of Phase 2 meeting this April and initiating the first pivotal trial in the second half of this year.”
Dr. Duker continued, “We anticipate topline data for the Phase 2 PAVIA clinical trial of EYP-1901 in moderately severe-to-severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) in the second quarter of 2024. We are excited about the potential of EYP-1901 in NPDR, a chronic disease where over 90% of patients currently receive no course of treatment until they develop sight-threatening complications. 2024

 Inside Eyepoint Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Revenue - Product   Highlight
The preparation of these financial statements requires that we make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.



 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Reimbursement of costs — We may provide research and development services and incur maintenance costs of licensed patents under collaboration arrangements to assist in advancing the development of licensed products.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
This increase was driven by revenue recognized as the combined performance obligations under the Alimera license and supply agreement are fulfilled.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
We act primarily as a principal in these transactions and, accordingly, reimbursement amounts received are classified as a component of revenue to be recognized consistent with the revenue recognition policy summarized above.
