Bartolacci, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated: “We had a strong finish to fiscal 2023 as demonstrated by our fourth quarter results.  I am pleased to report that the Company generated higher sales on a consolidated basis, and adjusted EBITDA growth in all three of our business segments, compared to a year ago.“In our Industrial Technologies segment, we reported another quarter of solid growth in operating results on the strength of our energy storage solutions.  Fiscal 2023 sales for this segment exceeded the $500 million target that we set at the beginning of the fiscal year, resulting in growth exceeding 50% over last year’s sales of $335.5 million.  Interest in our solutions remains high as we continue to work with auto manufacturers and battery producers in their development of dry battery electrode (DBE) solutions.“The Memorialization segment also performed well again in the fiscal 2023 fourth quarter, completing a very good year.  Despite the continued decline in U.S. deaths (reflecting lower COVID-related deaths), the segment’s sales remained relatively stable compared to a year ago.  In addition, adjusted EBITDA for the segment increased for the quarter and fiscal year reflecting improved price realization and continued emphasis on productivity improvements.“Finally, recent cost reduction actions taken by SGK Brand Solutions resulted in improved operating performance for the segment in the fiscal 2023 fourth quarter.  Although European market conditions continued to challenge the business, we reported higher adjusted EBITDA and improved margins during the recent quarter.The following information was filed by Matthews International Corp (MATW) on Friday, November 17, 2023 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.
