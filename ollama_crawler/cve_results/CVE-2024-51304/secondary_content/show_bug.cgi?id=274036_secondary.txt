Despite bug 269629 indicating this has been removed from the Portage mirrors I am still getting package tarball downloads failing due to this being in the rotation. dig shows NXDOMAIN:

 $ dig mirrors.sec.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de any

; <<>> DiG 9.6.0-P1 <<>> mirrors.sec.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de any
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:

;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0

;; QUESTION SECTION:
;mirrors.sec.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de.	IN ANY

;; Query time: 27 msec

;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 56

I don't have this in my rsync list so this is only a problem for tarballs, and I wouldn't even know about it except there seems to be a bad or missing tarball for XML-NamespaceSupport-1.10.

I'd like to confirm that. mirrors.sec.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de is still in the list and failing for me too.

Jose and Vadim: can you tell me how you're setting your list of mirrors? The mirror is not in mirror lists, so I'm not sure why you are seeing this being used to download distfiles.

I use paludis, so this is set in my /etc/paludis/mirrors.conf:

# mirrors.conf
# This file created by portage2paludis.bash
*  http://gentoo.osuosl.org//distfiles http://distro.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/distributions/gentoo//distfiles

I don't see mirrors.sec.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de here. Do you get this error for a specific package?

I haven't seen this happen in a while. The package I mentioned in the original report is where I saw this. 

I have never had this mirror explicitly set in either my current Paludis setup or my prior Portage setup, the listed mirrors are the only mirrors I have had configured since I started using Gentoo in early 2005.

Closing this for now, then. Please reopen if you see the problem again.
