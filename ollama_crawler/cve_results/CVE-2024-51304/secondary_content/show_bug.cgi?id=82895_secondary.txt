I think it could be useful for there to be an feature that can be set within the FEATURES flag to make the /var/tmp/portage dir a ramdisk.  When an emerge starts it could check for this flag, if there, mount /var/tmp/portage as a ramdisk/tmpfs and then contiune with the install.  
I am compiling openmotif right now in a ramdisk and it seems to be going a lot faster than usual.  I'll post a comparative time after it's finished compiling.  I think this could be a useful feature for those with a good chunk of ram.

mount -t tmpfs -o size=1G none /var/tmp/portage

You could even add it to /etc/fstab...
