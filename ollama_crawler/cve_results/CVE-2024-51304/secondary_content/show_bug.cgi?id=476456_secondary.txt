Description


José Fournier (RETIRED)






          2013-07-10 21:28:00 UTC
        

As a new developer devoted to translation (since July 4, 2013) I created an account at wiki.gentoo.org in order to translate pages into French. I also set up my wiki developer profile on LDAP following the instructions of this page : https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Gentoo_Wiki:Developer_Central/Getting_started.
At the moment I can edit pages on the wiki, but I cannot see the "Translate this page" link on translatable pages (I mean those with a language bar at the top).

To be accurate, I need to say that I had an account on the wiki prior to my becoming a developer and also acted as a first translator, translating the help page and some templates as required by the site.Then, I added myself to the "Gentoo_wiki: translation_account_request".  All this has been accomplished on June 11, 2013.
Recently Alex Legler merged my old account (non gentoo dev) with my new one but the problem remains.

My apologies Alex. I didn't want to put any pressure on you. It is just misunderstanding from me. Seeing an  already translated page I mistakenly thought the job was done.

Thanks. I will let you *explicitly* know when you can translate pages.
