(NYSE: OUT) today reported results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.“We were pleased to finish the year with our fourth quarter revenues at the higher end of guidance as a result of strength in our local business and automated sales channels, which offset the headwind created by the media strikes.” said Jeremy Male, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of OUTFRONT Media. “While it is still early in 2024, our business is accelerating and we expect that OUTFRONT, and the entire out-of-home industry, will benefit from a strong media market this year.”Three Months Ended December 31,Twelve Months Ended December 31,$ in Millions, except per share amounts2023202220232022Revenues$501.2 $494.7 $1,820.6 $1,772.1 Organic revenues501.2 494.7 1,805.4 1,757.9 Operating income (loss)111.0 105.0 (258.4)287.7 Adjusted OIBDA151.7 153.7 451.0 472.4 Net income (loss) before allocation to non-controlling interests60.7 59.5 (429.7)149.1 Net income (loss)160.4 59.2 (430.4)147.9 Net income (loss) per share1,2,3$0.35 $0.34 ($2.66)$0.84 Funds From Operations (FFO)199.3 103.0 130.0 325.2 Adjusted FFO (AFFO)1108.1 96.1 270.6 311.3 Shares outstanding3173.3 172.7 164.9 161.8 Notes: See exhibits for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures; 1) References to "Net income (loss)", "Net income (loss) per share", “FFO” and “AFFO” mean "Net income (loss) attributable to OUTFRONT Media Inc.", "Net income (loss) attributable to OUTFRONT Media Inc. per common share", “FFO attributable to OUTFRONT Media Inc.” and “AFFO attributable to OUTFRONT Media Inc.,” respectively; 2) References to “per share” means per common share for diluted earnings per weighted average share; 3) Diluted weighted average shares outstanding.Fourth Quarter 2023 ResultsConsolidatedReported revenues of $501.2 million increased $6.5 million, or 1.3%, for the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to the same prior-year period.  Organic revenues of $501.2 million increased $6.5 million, or 1.3%. Reported billboard revenues of $389.1 million increased $11.6 million, or 3.1%, due to higher average revenue per display (yield) compared to the same prior-year period, driven by the impact of programmatic and direct sale advertising platforms on digital billboard revenues, the impact of new and lost billboards in the period, including acquisitions, and higher proceeds from condemnations. Organic billboard revenues of $389.1 million increased $11.6 million, or 3.1%.Reported transit and other revenues of $112.1 million decreased $5.1 million, or 4.4%, due primarily to a decrease in average revenue per display (yield) compared to the same prior-year period, partially offset by the 1The following information was filed by Outfront Media Inc.

 Inside Outfront Media Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for information about adoption of new accounting standards and recent accounting pronouncements.



 Other - Other   Highlight
As a result of the current market-wide supply shortages and logistics disruptions, we have experienced delays and price increases with respect to certain of our digital displays, which may continue throughout 2024, and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
A qualitative test assesses macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance and other relevant entity specific events, as well as events affecting a reporting unit.

 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
There can be no assurance that these estimates and assumptions will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future, and a downward revision of these estimates and/or assumptions would decrease our cash flows, which could result in additional impairment charges in the future.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Though the Company cannot reasonably estimate the full impact of the current heightened levels of inflation on our business, financial condition and results of operations at this time, a portion of these increases may be partially offset by increases in advertising rates on our displays and cost efficiencies.
