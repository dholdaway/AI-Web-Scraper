qtgui build log

I noticed the following errors when rebuilding world with gcc 6.2.0 (from the hardened overlay). The packages that exhibit this are: qtgui-5.7.0, qtopengl-5.7.0, qtprintsupport-5.7.0, qtwidgets-5.7.0.

All aforementioned packages fail during the compile phase with:

avx512.cpp:51:4: error: #error "Feature not supported"
 #  error "Feature not supported"
    ^~~~~
avx512.cpp: In function ‘int main(int, char**)’:
avx512.cpp:61:42: warning: AVX512F vector return without AVX512F enabled changes the ABI [-Wpsabi]
     i = _mm512_maskz_loadu_epi32(0, argv);
                                          ^
gmake: *** [Makefile:163: avx512.o] Error 1
avx512f disabled.

My CFLAGS is set to "-march=skylake -O2 -pipe". According to GCC manual, march=skylake doesn't enable AVX512.

I'm attaching qtgui build log and emerge --info.

The errors earlier in the log are a normal part of Qt's configuration process.

The final error is more concerning as the gles2 check failed but you have that USE flag enabled.

It seems it must have been a mesa issue (I'm using live mesa). The problem does no longer manifest with current mesa builds. Please close this as invalid.

Nope, my bad. I thought qtnetwork was affected too but I've just tried qtprintsupport and I still get the same...

Now it's gone. So I supposed it could have been a mesa issue.

I'm sorry for the noise generated, please close.
