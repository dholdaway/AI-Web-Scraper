Description

I was using app-emulation/virtualbox-1.5.0 to run Windows XP. Windows XP was running fast as hell. Faster with Virtualbox than with anything else (VMWare, qemu+kvm).

Yesterday I did sync my system and updated virtualbox to 1.5.2.
This version is very slow, I can see each frame while the BIOS screen is fading.
Also windows XP runs very slow, sounds gets distorted.

I wanted to get back to 1.5.0, but this version was removed from portage.

I also checked that this performance difference wasn't due to some system change. I did so by checking out virtualbox-1.5.0-r1 from a older portage snapshot and then emerging it from a local overlay.
Virtualbox-1.5.0 ran with extremely high performance like I was expecting.

I'm running Virtualbox-1.5.0 with AMD-SVM virtualization extension support. I tried disabling this on 1.5.2 but it was also slow.
So.. I can confirm this is a 1.5.2 version issue.

I don't know if there is someone experiencing similar vbox behavior, if so, I think having version 1.5.0 on portage would be nice.

Portage 2.1.3.16 (default-linux/amd64/2007.0, gcc-4.1.2, glibc-2.6.1-r0, 2.6.22-gentoo-r9 x86_64)

Might want to see if someone has reported similar issues to http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Bugtracker and then report your issue upstream and post the url back here.

I can't reproduce this anymore.

Reinstalling guest additions on guest OS fixes it.

Virtualbox-1.5.2 is at full speed. Thanks!
