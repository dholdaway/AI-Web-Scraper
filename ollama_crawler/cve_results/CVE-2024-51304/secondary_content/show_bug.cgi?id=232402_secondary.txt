When I was in the middle of emerge -uD world,it stopped at "xulrunner".Before that,it emerged Python-2.5.2-r5.Then I tried to fix it with python-updater,but in vain. Python-updater added "beryl-settings-bindings" to the list,but this package was already excluded from portage.It makes no sense that python-updater needs it to update. 
See below :

Try:

Add x11-misc/beryl-settings-bindings to /etc/portage/package.unmask
Then emerge -C x11-misc/beryl-settings-bindings
Then remove from package.unmask

Continue as you were.

This message meant that x11-misc/beryl-settings-bindings-0.2.1 was masked by inexistence (this message was fixed in newer versions of Portage). You should have used `python-updater -i`.
