installing dev-libs/nss-3.13.1 will render bugs.gentoo.org completely unusable in Chromium, and certificate can't be added to trust.   Downgrading back to dev-libs/nss-3.12.11-r1  resolves the issue.. Highly recommend that Gentoo change the CA issuer to resolve this problem and regain trust from it's user base..  Although downgrading dev-libs/nss might fix the issue, it still isn't a nice work around to use outdated SSL information. Please Fix

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.install dev-libs/nss-3.13.1
2.try visiting https://bugs.gentoo.org
3.Revoked Certificate, no option to continue anyway.


Expected Results:  
A working bugs.gentoo.org at least with the option to "continue anyway" like before.

I should note that this is while using Chromium 17.0.928.0 (Developer Build 108408 Linux) which is from floppym's 9999 ebuild. I have been notified that nss-3.13.1 doesn't break bugs.gentoo.org in stable chromium releases, however this should be addressed as the site has had an invalid certificate for way too long now.

Not sure how this happened, but after re-emerging chromium-9999 and clearing the chromium cache from the "under the hood" settings, the problem has gone away.. Seems that now the warning is also gone that use to exist for the certificate. I will close this bug now :)
