Please set this in your kernel:

CONFIG_SND_PCM_OSS:
To enable OSS digital audio (PCM) emulation (/dev/dsp*), say Y
here and read <file:Documentation/sound/alsa/OSS-Emulation.txt>.
Many programs still use the OSS API, so say Y.

Location: -> Device Drivers -> Sound card support (SOUND [=y]) -> Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (SND [=y])

Yes, k4guitune is using OSS instead of ALSA.   And I'm reclutant in adding linux-info.eclass based config check for CONFIG_SND_PCM_OSS because far as I know you might as well be compiling alsa-drivers outside of kernel itself which would just return false positive.

So... Feel free to close this as WORKSFORME after enabling OSS in kernel and testing it works.

Yes, it works!
Enabling OSS-emulation in the ALSA-section of the kernel did the job.
(Enabling the old depreceated oss in the kernel was the wrong way I did before...)
