Description

          2014-11-09 22:44:10 UTC
        

When dash is used as the system shell, mod_wsgi fails to build with errors similar to that of apache in
https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=526178

Reproducible: Always

So I guess the same thing goes here, I guess, that you have to re-emerge apr.

Reinstalling dev-libs/apr-1.5.0-r2 indeed solved the problem. /usr/share/build-1/libtool now explicitely depends on /bin/bash. Maybe apr should be bumped to dev-libs/apr-1.5.0-r3?

I don't think this is still relevant.
