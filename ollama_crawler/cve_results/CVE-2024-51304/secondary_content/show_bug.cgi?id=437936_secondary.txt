No idea what has broke automounting again for usb devices like MP4, now, I am asked for root password to be able to mount it (!)

Sadly, I won't be able to test it this weekend, I hopefully will try it in the next days.

$ emerge -Opv gvfs udisks:2 polkit udev

These are the packages that would be merged, in order:

[ebuild   R   ~] gnome-base/gvfs-1.12.3-r1  USE="bluetooth cdda fuse gnome-keyring http udev udisks -afp -archive -avahi -bluray -doc -gdu -gphoto2 -ios -samba" 1,332 kB
[ebuild   R   ~] sys-fs/udisks-2.0.0  USE="crypt gptfdisk introspection -debug -systemd" 0 kB
[ebuild   R   ~] sys-auth/polkit-0.107-r1  USE="gtk introspection nls pam -examples -kde (-selinux) -systemd" 1,351 kB
[ebuild   R   ~] sys-fs/udev-189  USE="acl gudev hwdb keymap openrc -doc -introspection (-selinux) -static-libs" 1,341 kB


Reproducible: Always

It would do that if it doesn't recognize the drive as removable media but instead as a static (internal) disk of the machine.

If you encounter this again, you can check the `udisksctl dump` output if it's marked as "Removable: true" or not.

The problem is that this looks to appear disappear on every udisks/udev bump, will try to remember it I encounter it again ;)
