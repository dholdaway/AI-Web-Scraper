Description

Some of the 'subsidiary' libsdl ebuilds (the ones shown in the summary) generate .la files which depend on svgalib if built when the svga use flag is enabled, but don't have svga? dependency lines in their ebuilds. Hence, when the svga use flag is disabled and svgalib is removed from the system any packages that require these sdl libraries will fail to compile because the /usr/lib/libsd-*.la file will still have an -lsvga library line.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have the sdl libraries built when the svga use flag is active
2.Disable the svga use flag and unmerge svgalib
3.Run emerge -uDv --newuse, then revdep-rebuild. Tuxtype for sure (maybe others?) will fail during linking with '-lvga' not found errors.




I doubt this is an important bug, as the fix is simply to recompile the sdl-* libraries and it probably impacts very few users. It's just something I ran into while removing svgalib from my system,  which is encouraged by bug http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=195632. I'm filing it as an FYI for others with the same issue. Feel free to close this out.

yep, good for finding in bugzilla but changing use flags does sometimes need manual labor.
