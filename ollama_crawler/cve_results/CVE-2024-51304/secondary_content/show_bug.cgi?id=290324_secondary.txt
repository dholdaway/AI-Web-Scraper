Description

Rebuilt system to Gentoo Multilib AMD64, also upgrade to gnome-2.26 at same time. When system starts and I log into Gnome (xdm/gdm) I see the proper background come up then disappear to be replaced with only the base colour.
This same for all accounts including root and a test account I created to check it. I have searched gconf to no avail and cannot change it in "Change Desktop Background" I have had to change the colour as it is rather lurid under most of the choices for wallpaper.

Reproducible: Always




I should have had a background image come up for my wallpaper.

I think it is probably some setting somewhere that needs fixing, but have had no success in finding it.  The forums have nothing on it as well, plus have checked the Gnome forums and the OpenDesktop forums also.

I have been on this bug for a week now with no success at all in finding anything even similar enough to it to have a starting point.

sounds like your system has a bigger problem

Yeah, I turned 'Tracker' off, it shouldn't be there.
Also, nothing wrong with these drives, double checked when you sent this message.

Another thing, is that going to cause the problem I posted? Remember, this problem is for all users, root included, do you want the .xsession-errors from root as well?

          2009-10-27 17:50:02 UTC
        

xsession-errors should be almost the same for all users. If it's not a disk problem, then maybe it's a jpeg or shared-mime-info issue ? did you recently updated one of these packages and not applied changes required by them ?

As stated, I rebuilt the os for AMD64-multilib, from scratch, and during that the gnome was upgraded in the tree to 2.26. All updates were carried through with etc-update & '-5'.  The background I'm using is one the gnome stock.

Also all image types are being parsed in the other programs like the browser and image viewers.  It still comes up for a second, then is replaced with the blanket colour.  As in how Gnome starts, then restarts some stuff after the panels come up.

I have spent the last three days rebuilding my system again, same packages as before.  I saved the 'world' file, used thew minimal install, stage three, then rebuilt from the world file using '# emerge -auv --noreplace $(cat world)'.

Now this is, as far as I know, exactly the same as I had, however, when finished (5 mins ago) everything that wasn't working is now, including having the backgrounds work again.

I have marked this bug as "Resolved:WORKSFORME"

Thank you for your time, it is much appreciated!
