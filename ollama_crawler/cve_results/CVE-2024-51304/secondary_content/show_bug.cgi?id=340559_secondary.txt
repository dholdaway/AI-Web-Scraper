Description

Some sections of the application's manual page seem to exhibit poor grammar.

Examples:

---
"The program oneko creates a cute cat chasing around your mouse cursor."

"If the cat catchup the ``mouse'', start sleeping."

"Make cat into 'tora-neko'.  'Tora-neko' means cat wite tiger-like stripe."
---

Overall, the manual page needs some touching-up.
