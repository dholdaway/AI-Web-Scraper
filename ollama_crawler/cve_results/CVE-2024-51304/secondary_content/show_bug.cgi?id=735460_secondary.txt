Description

recent Portage spits out things like:

 * QA Notice: Unresolved soname dependencies:
 * 
 *      /gentoo/prefix64l/bin/ed: libc.so.1
 * 

we should provide a package or some other hack that, based on the platform, mods  a vdb entry, such that Portage knows these libs are provided by something (e.g. the fake package) and stops complaining about it

We should hand-pick the list of libs to provide (and not blindly register all) such that we would indeed get useful results from this QA check about badly depending on host-provided libs.

Second thought, might want to do this during bootstrap time, because doing it from Portage might be difficult, downside is we cannot update the list in that case.

Given the complexity to "just" fix this, I've applied

in portage.git which silences the check
