According to https://fedorahosted.org/sssd/ticket/1121
Starting from sssd already support heimdal krb.

ebuild should change to virtual/krb5

    virtual/krb5
    || (
        >=app-crypt/mit-krb5-1.9.1
        >=app-crypt/heimdal-1.5[-ssl]
    )

Reproducible: Always

Cannot get it build with the patch.

Something is missing...

It shouldn't need to depend on both virtual/krb5 and its RDEPENDs.

Can't build at all.
It is a up stream issue...

What should we do?

Tag it as won't fix?

If it is an upstream issue, check if there is a bug for it. If not, and you can test the thing, it might be better to create a ticket and see how upstream wants it?
