While the macroeconomic environment remains challenging, we have identified and begun to implement several key initiatives to improve execution. Looking ahead, 2024 will be a year of strengthening our foundation for future growth,” said BK Kalra, President and CEO, Genpact. “As Genpact’s new CEO, my top priority is to sharpen our focus and drive increased speed and accountability throughout the organization to reach our full potential.”Key Financial Highlights – Full Year 2023•Total revenue was $4.48 billion, up 2% year-over-year (3% on a constant currency basis).1,2•Revenue from Data-Tech-AI services was $1.99 billion, up 2% year-over-year, both on an as reported and constant currency basis,1,2 representing 45% of total revenue.•Revenue from Digital Operations services was $2.48 billion, up 3% year-over-year (4% on a constant currency basis),1 representing 55% of total revenue. •Net income was $631 million, up 79% year-over-year, including a non-recurring tax benefit of $170 million related to an intercompany transfer of intellectual property, with a corresponding margin of 14.1%.•Income from operations was $631 million, up 26% year-over-year, with a corresponding margin of 14.1%. •Adjusted income from operations was $763 million, up 6% year-over-year, with a corresponding margin of 17.0%.5,6•Diluted earnings per share was $3.41, up 81% year-over-year, including a non-recurring tax benefit of $170 million related to an intercompany transfer of intellectual property. Adjusted diluted earnings per share4,5 was $2.98, up 9% year-over-year. •New bookings were approximately $4.9 billion, up 26% year-over-year.71 Revenue growth on a constant currency basis is a non-GAAP measure and is calculated by restating current-period activity using the prior fiscal period’s foreign currency exchange rates adjusted for hedging gains/losses in such period.2 Total revenue and revenue from Data-Tech-AI services for the full year 2023 and full year 2022 include $0.5 million and $12 million of revenue, respectively, associated with a business classified as held for sale.3 Both on an as reported and constant currency basis.4 Adjusted diluted earnings per share is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of GAAP diluted earnings per share to adjusted diluted earnings per share is attached to this release. During the quarter ended December 31, 2023, we completed an intercompany transfer of certain intellectual property rights from non-US to US wholly-owned subsidiaries, which resulted in a non-recurring tax benefit of $170 million. Net income and diluted earnings per share for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023 included this benefit. This benefit is excluded from adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023.5 Income from operations and diluted earnings per share for the full year 2022 included a $39 million restructuring charge related to lease impairment charges and employee severance charges, as well as a $33 million impairment charge and a $25 million loss on the sale of a business previously classified as held for sale. These items were excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share for the full year 2022.6 Adjusted income from operations and adjusted income from operations margin are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of each of GAAP income from operations and GAAP net income to adjusted income from operations and GAAP income from operations margin and GAAP net income margin to adjusted income from operations margin are attached to this release. Adjusted income from operations margin for the full year 2022 and full year 2023 was derived by adjusting total revenue to exclude $12 million and $0.5 million of revenue, respectively, associated with a business previously classified as held for sale.7 New bookings, an operating measure, represents the total contract value of new contracts and certain renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts.Regular renewals of contracts with no change in scope are not counted as new bookings.The following information was filed by Genpact Ltd (G) on Thursday, February 8, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.

 Inside Genpact Ltd's 10-K Annual Report:


 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
While some of our contracts provide for limited sharing of the risk of inflation and fluctuations in currency exchange rates, we bear a substantial portion of this risk, and therefore our operating results could be negatively affected by adverse changes in wage inflation rates and foreign currency exchange rates.



 Other - Other   Highlight
An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements or require a higher degree of judgment than others in their application.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
Nevertheless, despite these steps, we expect general increases in wage levels in the future, which could adversely affect our margins.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Although these estimates are based upon management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results could differ from these estimates.

 M & A - Other   Highlight
In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances assumed in connection with business combinations are initially estimated as of the acquisition date, and we reevaluate these items quarterly with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date).
