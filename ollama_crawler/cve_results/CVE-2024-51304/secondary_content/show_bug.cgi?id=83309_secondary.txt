Description

          2005-02-25 07:55:27 UTC
        

When emerging php w/ USE="readline", configure fails to find readline even though it is on the system. Package merges correctly without USE="readline".

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. USE="readline" emerge php
Actual Results:  
checking for readline in -lreadline... no
configure: error: readline library not found

!!! ERROR: dev-php/php-5.0.3 failed.
!!! Function econf, Line 485, Exitcode 0
!!! econf failed
!!! If you need support, post the topmost build error, NOT this status message.


Expected Results:  
Correctly found and used readline.

See config.log attached.

Works for me with dev-php/php-5.0.3-r1. Please reopen if you still experience this issue.
