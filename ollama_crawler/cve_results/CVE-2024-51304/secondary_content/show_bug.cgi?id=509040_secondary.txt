Description

After trying to install app-crypt/truecrypt following the instructions given by portage, I cannot execute the last command

curl 'http://git.gnupg.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=scute.git;a=blob_plain;f=src/pkcs11.h;hb=38bdba0bb1ab93950489c645938c93ed577f9139' > /usr/portage/distfiles/truecrypt-7.1a-pkcs11.h

because the web host cannot be accessed. I also tried to access it via a proxy but still couldn't access it which makes me believe that the web address changed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. echo "app-crypt/truecrypt ~amd64" >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keyword
2. emerge app-crypt/truecrypt
3. Download Truecrypt .tar.gz tarball from http://www.truecrypt.org/downloads2 website as requested by ebuild
4. curl 'http://git.gnupg.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=scute.git;a=blob_plain;f=src/pkcs11.h;hb=38bdba0bb1ab93950489c645938c93ed577f9139' > /usr/portage/distfiles/truecrypt-7.1a-pkcs11.h as requested by ebuild
Actual Results:  
curl 'http://git.gnupg.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=scute.git;a=blob_plain;f=src/pkcs11.h;hb=38bdba0bb1ab93950489c645938c93ed577f9139' > /usr/portage/distfiles/truecrypt-7.1a-pkcs11.h

>> http://git.gnupg.org cannot be accessed either from curl or any web browser

Expected Results:  
File should have been generated without issues.

Works fine here. Try again.

Now it works. Sorry for the problem.
Probably git.gnupg.org was down. Strange because gnupg.org was online and I could ping git.gnupg.org.

Anyway now it works and I successfully installed truecrypt.
Marking this as solved (although it could even be deleted).

Thank you very much Jeroen.
