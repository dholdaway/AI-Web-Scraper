Description

I got stuck slightly having /usr on lvm as this was unmounted before bcmxcp_usb was called to kill power.

$ ldd /lib/nut/bcmxcp_usb
libusb-0.1.so.4 => /usr/lib/libusb-0.1.so.4 (0x00002addf3530000)
libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x00002addf3638000)
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00002addf3413000)

(not a big concern for me - I'm going to try to move to a hibernate on powerfail.)

This fix to libusb should have been committed already?
