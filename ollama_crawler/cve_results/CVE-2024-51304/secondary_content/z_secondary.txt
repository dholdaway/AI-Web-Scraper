Exhibit 99.1 Contacts:InvestorsBrad Berningir@zillowgroup.comMediaChrissy Roebuckpress@zillow.comZillow Group Reports Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2022 Financial ResultsSEATTLE — Feb. 15, 2023 — Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: Z and ZG), which is transforming the way people buy, sell, rent and finance homes, today announced its consolidated financial results for the three months ended and year ended Dec. 31, 2022.Complete financial results and outlook for the first quarter of 2023 can be found in the shareholder letter on the Investor Relations section of Zillow Group’s website at https://investors.zillowgroup.com/investors/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx.“While navigating a slow and difficult housing market in 2022, we kept our eyes on the future — our vision of building the housing super app,” said Zillow co-founder and CEO Rich Barton. “Our consolidated Q4 financial results outperformed our expectations, and we’ve been rapidly shipping products aligned with our five growth pillars. We’re building momentum that will help us scale as we serve customers and the industry with an easier, more seamless way to transact in real estate.”  Recent highlights include:•Zillow Group’s fourth-quarter results exceeded the company’s outlook at a consolidated level for both revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. •Consolidated Q4 revenue was $435 million, and full-year 2022 revenue from continuing operations was $2.0 billion.◦IMT segment revenue was above the high end of the company’s outlook range, declining 14% year over year to $417 million. ▪Driven by the relative strength at the top of the company’s funnel, Premier Agent revenue outperformed the company’s expectations and the industry total transaction dollar decline of 31%, decreasing 20% year over year to $283 million for Q4. ▪Rentals revenue increased 13% year over year to $68 million as the company continued to see strong traffic and growth in multifamily properties.◦Mortgages segment revenue was $18 million for Q4, near the midpoint of the company’s outlook range.•On a GAAP basis, consolidated net loss was $72 million for Q4 and $101 million for 2022. Consolidated net loss from continuing operations was $72 million for Q4 and $88 million for 2022. Segment income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes for the IMT, Homes and Mortgages segments was $(22) million, $(13) million and $(51) million in Q4, and $160 million, $(93) million and $(167) million for full-year 2022, respectively.  IMT segment income from continuing operations before income taxes margin contracted to 9% from 29% in 2021.•Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $73 million for Q4 and $514 million for full-year 2022. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations by segment was $113 million, $(8) million and $(32) million for the IMT, Homes and Mortgages segments in Q4, and $672 million, $(66) million and $(92) million for full-year 2022, respectively.  The Q4 consolidated results were primarily driven by higher-than-anticipated margins in the company’s IMT segment as revenue outperformed the company’s expectations.  The 2022 results were driven primarily by IMT segment Adjusted EBITDA margin contracting to 37% from 45% in 2021 as the company continued to invest during a weaker macroeconomic environment. The following information was filed by Zillow Group, Inc. (Z) on Wednesday, February 15, 2023 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.

 Inside Zillow Group, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
The increase in IMT segment gross profit was driven by an improvement in gross margin from 87% to 89%, primarily associated with increased revenue, discussed above.



 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
Unforeseen events, changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in estimates of future cash flows could adversely affect the fair value of our assets and could result in an impairment charge.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses consist of advertising costs and other sales expenses related to promotional and marketing activities, headcount-related expenses, including salaries, commissions, benefits, bonuses and share-based compensation expense for sales, sales support, customer support, including the customer connections team, marketing and public relations employees, depreciation expense and amortization of certain intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions, including trade names and trademarks and customer relationships.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
The decrease in technology and development expenses in the Homes segment was primarily attributable to a $55 million decrease in headcount-related costs, including share-based compensation expense, which was primarily driven by the wind down of Zillow Offers and the reduction in indirect costs related to the Homes segment.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
The decrease in total revenue was primarily attributable to the following: Mortgages segment revenue decreased by $127 million to $119 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $246 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, driven primarily by a decrease in revenue generated by Zillow Home Loans, as total loan origination volumes decreased 62% primarily resulting from a decrease in demand for refinance mortgages attributable to the rising and volatile interest rate environment.
