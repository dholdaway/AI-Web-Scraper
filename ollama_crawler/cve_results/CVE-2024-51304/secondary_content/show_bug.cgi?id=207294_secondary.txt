The summary says it all. Tab completion fails on flac files. To test:

$ touch foo.flac
$ ls foo<TAB> # completes
CTRL-C
$ mplayer foo<TAB> # does not complete

I'm not sure exactly how bash completion is defined, so I'll give someone with more knowledge a chance to address this first. Otherwise, I'll try to figure it out and fix it whenever I get a chance.

Okay, nevermind. This is fixed in 20060301 with a patch. Is there any reason that version is still not stable?
