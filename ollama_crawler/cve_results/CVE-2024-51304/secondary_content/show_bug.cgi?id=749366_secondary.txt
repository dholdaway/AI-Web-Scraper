attempting to create a new Debian lxc container using "buster" or "bullseye" results in an abort due to an incorrect or out of date keyring.

This may be related to the SKS server hack...

Few things to try: 
You can try to import the new PGP keys they use to sign those those releases. For buster, they seem to be available here:
https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2019/04/msg00008.html

cd /tmp
wget https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys/archive-key-10.asc https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys/archive-key-10-security.asc
gpg --import archive-key-10.asc
gpg --import archive-key-10-security.asc
lxc-create -n deb -t debian -- -r buster

Also "lxc-create -n deb -t download -- -r buster" may work better for you too. 

(I'm currently not around my lxc machine)
