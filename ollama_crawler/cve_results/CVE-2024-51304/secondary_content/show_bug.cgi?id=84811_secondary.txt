Description

I just installed gentoo - and emerged gnome a few days ago (because the arts sound was terrible under kde) - but i have noticed one little quirk - which i'm sure you'll be able to fix quickly.
In the gnome menu Applications->Desktop Preferences->Advanced->Preferred Application - I have mozilla firefox selected.  Which is fine as that is my installed browser - but for the first few days my links wouldn't work (click on a link in thunderbird and nothing opened).  I noticed today that it has the wrong "executable" name mozilla-firebird (when was it called that)?  Anyway a one line edit and it works correctly for me - but i thought you might be able to change the default?

Thanks for all your work

Martin

Developer relations is not the proper location for ebuild problems.

I don't think this is anything mozilla@ can fix.

This works fine for me with:

gnome-base/control-center-2.10.0
www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.0.2-r1

reporter: has this problem been resolved in the later versions for you?  ( I
also cannot reproduce )

Thanks!

Well I did resolve my problem by changing the "executable" name in Gnome to
firefox instead of mozilla-firefox.  It just seems like some script was off.  I
haven't reinstalled gnome or gentoo - so I haven't had the chance to see if it
is still there.

Shall we just call it fixed?
