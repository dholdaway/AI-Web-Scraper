x11-base/xorg-server-1.9.2 is marked as stable on amd64 and the latest nvidia-drivers caueses a block with COMMON="<x11-base/xorg-server-1.8.99

!!! One or more updates have been skipped due to a dependency conflict:

x11-base/xorg-server:0

  (x11-base/xorg-server-1.9.2, ebuild scheduled for merge) conflicts with
    <x11-base/xorg-server-1.8.99 required by (x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers-195.36.31, installed)


!!! The following update(s) have been skipped due to unsatisfied dependencies
!!! triggered by backtracking:

x11-drivers/xf86-input-synaptics:0



Reproducible: Always
