Description

Currently ntp-client init script does not depend on wicd, resulting on failure.

I fixed the issue by inserting "after wicd" line to ntp-client init script.

(I am reporting this bug, because I believe there is a more clean, general way to solve it)

Reproducible: Always

I also have this problem. However, there might be situations where you get your internet connection without wicd. Changing Summary.

we're not going to spread cruft around the system.  either wicd provides net or it doesnt, no other package should care.  ntp is not special at all in this regard.

Personally, I'd suggest net-misc/openntpd which doesn't have this problem with wicd.

Alternatively, as with bug 289577, if someone provides a working solution with baselayout-1 AND -2, I will consider. Note: NetworkManager doesn't provide net either...

Does it provide an ntp client too? I guess for most laptop-users out there the problem is that ntp-client tries to set the system clock before there is an internet connection.

Yup, I only use the client it provides on my laptops.

No one found the solutions? 
I have just installed ntp in my laptop for using ntp-client and when my pc started ntp exit with problem.

The problem born because ntp-client try to set clock when connect ( with wifi or wired ) not established.

I tried edit ntp-client init script with "after wicd" in depend()  function, but this not have effect. 

How I resolve this problems? 

My wicd version : 1.7.0
My ntp version: 4.2.4_p7-r1

thanks for help and sorry for my english

Following Jeremy in comment #3, I now use net-misc/openntpd which has no problem if you are offline from time to time. You can try that.

We'll not change this (similar to bug 289577).
E-mail me if you are still interested in this change and have a convincing solution.
