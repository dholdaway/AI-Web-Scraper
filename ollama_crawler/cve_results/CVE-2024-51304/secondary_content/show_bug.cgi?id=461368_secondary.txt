Description

It appears that the configure check for poppler >=0.20.0 doesn't work:
checking for poppler... yes
checking if Catalog::optContent exists... yes
checking if BaseStream constructor needs 2 arguments... yes
checking if we have Poppler >= 0.20.0... no
checking for podofo... disabled

Probably it's fixed in upstream git but I couldn't find the patch in trac.

Reproducible: Always

config.log would likely be useful, but if the error was 'no matching function for call to 'SplashOutputDev::startDoc(XRef*)'', that's a 0.20, not 0.22 change.

That's right, and because the test for poppler >=20 failed, the code for <20 was used. Yesterday the config test failed several times but I cannot reproduce it any more - perhaps due to distcc. Closing - Thanks!
