It’s a testament to our market leading position, quality of our products, and the high level of Nikola fleet success. We are making the most of our head start and capitalizing on our first-mover advantage.”Launch of the Hydrogen Fuel Cell Electric Truck and Hydrogen Refueling EcosystemIn Q4 2023, we demonstrated our ability to produce, manufacture, and deliver the hydrogen fuel cell electric truck.

Fleets are operating the trucks daily, fueling at our first modular refueling site in Ontario, Calif. and our partner FirstElement Fuel’s station in Oakland, Calif.Looking forward to 2024, we are focused on optimizing revenue and costs in our business, as we seek to scale hydrogen fuel cell electric truck production, secure additional modular refueling sites and deploy modular fuelers to support fleets and bring the battery-electric product back to the marketplace.Hydrogen Fuel Cell Electric TruckIn Q4 2023, we delivered what we believe is the first production hydrogen fuel cell electric truck available in North America. We produced 42, delivering 35 of those to dealers and reserved seven for continued testing and fleet demos. Every truck delivered to dealers is spoken for by an end user, some of which are already utilizing the trucks in operations daily.

 Inside Nikola Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Expense   Highlight
The credit market and financial services industry have in the past, and may in the future, experience periods of upheaval that could impact the availability and cost of equity and debt financing.



 Financial - Debt   Highlight
The terms of debt securities or other debt financing agreements could impose significant restrictions on our operations and may require us to pledge certain assets.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Due to cumulative losses, we maintain a valuation allowance against U.S. and state deferred tax assets.

 Financial - Shares   Highlight
Equity in net loss of affiliates consists of our net portion of gains and losses from equity method investments, primarily Nikola Iveco Europe GmbH through the date of divestiture on June 29, 2023.

 Other - Other   Highlight
If capital is not available to us when, and in the amounts needed, we could be required to delay, scale back, or abandon some or all of our operations and development programs, which would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
