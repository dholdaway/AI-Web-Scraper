Description

When trying vmware-workstation, I discovered that script /etc/init.d/vmware does not start properly (vmnetwork does not start) with --as-needed, in version =1.0.0.23-r1 (from vmware overlay).

It works as expected by executing: LDFLAGS="" emerge -1 vmware-modules
So I suggest to filter that LDFLAG inside ebuild to avoid breakage (despite this is from vmware overlay, it could be applied too to =app-emulation/vmware-modules-1.0.0.23 from main portage tree).

Reproducible: Always

I'm afraid I'm not near my testing machine, but I'm pretty certain that this builds and runs correctly.  Can you please include the output from "emerge --info" and also provide the output of dmesg after attempting to modprobe vmnet...

Can't reproduce now recompiling with --as-needed LDFLAG, maybe the problem was other.. sorry for making noise, but I really though it was this issue :(

No probs, I'm going to remark this as WORKSFORME.  Do feel free to reopen this if you manage to recreate it...  5:)
