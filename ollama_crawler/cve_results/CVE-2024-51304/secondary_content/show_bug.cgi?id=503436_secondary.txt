I have a folder in my bookmarks bar. 

While I'm trying to synchronize my bookmarks with my google account it does not export the that folder. 

I don't know if it is a regression, it just happened right now during the switch to another pc.

Err. It is a regression because in the past the sync includes also the directories. I just don't know since which version it does not work as expected.

I really don't see the point of this question.

I don't see a point of replying to it and not answering the question.

I'd like to distinguish between a bug on the client side and possible hiccups on the server side.
