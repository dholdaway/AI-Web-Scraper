 Inside Theravance Biopharma, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
We indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences, subject to certain limits.



 Other - Other   Highlight
However, as the sublease market continues to evolve, it is possible that we will need to adjust our assumptions and record an impairment charge (non-cash) in a future period.

Such statements are based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
External-related expenses increased by $5.0 million and was primarily attributed to professional and financial advisory services and intellectual property protection services, such as the Hatch Waxman litigation, and the increase in SG&A allocated overhead expenses was driven by the reduction in our research activities which resulted in a larger absorption of such expenses by SG&A.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
The contingent liabilities related to sale of future royalties and the debt amortization are based on current estimates of the amount and timing of future royalty payments, including the potential for any future funding milestones.
