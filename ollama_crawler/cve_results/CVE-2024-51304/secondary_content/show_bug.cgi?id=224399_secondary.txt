All of my volumes are setup with LVM2/EVMS.  After a new install, I found that my /dev/mapper/decrypthome was not being automatically mounted because the evms initscript was being run after the dmcrypt one on boot.

Reproducible: Always

We do.
Users can add this to /etc/conf.d/dmcrypt
rc_after="evms"

OR this to /etc/rc.conf
rc_dmcrypt_after="evms"
