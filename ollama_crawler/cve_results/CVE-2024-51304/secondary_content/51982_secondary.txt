Fixes this build failure, which I believe was caused by 47722e8.

git checkout 7-1-stable
cd activerecord && bundle exec rake db:postgresql:rebuild postgresql:test

/rails/activerecord/test/cases/dirty_test.rb:975:in `<class:DirtyTest>': undefined method `supports_identity_columns?' for DirtyTest:Class (NoMethodError)
  if current_adapter?(:PostgreSQLAdapter) && supports_identity_columns?
                                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Did you mean?  supports_nulls_not_distinct?
	from /rails/activerecord/test/cases/dirty_test.rb:11:in `<top (required)>'
	from <internal:/usr/local/lib/ruby/site_ruby/3.2.0/rubygems/core_ext/kernel_require.rb>:37:in `require'
	from <internal:/usr/local/lib/ruby/site_ruby/3.2.0/rubygems/core_ext/kernel_require.rb>:37:in `require'
	from /usr/local/bundle/gems/rake-13.2.1/lib/rake/rake_test_loader.rb:21:in `block in <main>'
	from /usr/local/bundle/gems/rake-13.2.1/lib/rake/rake_test_loader.rb:6:in `select'
	from /usr/local/bundle/gems/rake-13.2.1/lib/rake/rake_test_loader.rb:6:in `<main>'

I can't explain why this only fails in 7-1-stable, maybe @yahonda or @fatkodima knows?

















    Sorry, something went wrong.

 supports_identity_columns? 





It's defined on main/7-2-stable here, appears to not be defined in the same place on 7-1-stable
