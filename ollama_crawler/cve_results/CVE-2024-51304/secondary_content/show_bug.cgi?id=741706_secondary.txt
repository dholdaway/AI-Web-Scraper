app-emulation/faudio should be utilizing MULTILIB_COMPAT in all of its versions since it is -* for most arches.

Setting MULTILIB_COMPAT=( abi_x86_32 abi_x86_64 ) would align best with this package and not add new metadata as new ABIs are declared.

See multilib-build.eclass for more details on what this does
