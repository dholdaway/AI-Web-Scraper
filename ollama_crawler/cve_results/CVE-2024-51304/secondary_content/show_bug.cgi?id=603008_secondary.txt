Created attachment 456590 [details]
utftest1.txt

st crashes when trying to display REVERSED HAND WITH MIDDLE FINGER
EXTENDED. I have attached "utftest1.txt". Just do "cat utftest1.txt" to
crash your terminal.

It happens if I change "font" in default savedconfig to following:

    static char font[] = "Fira Mono:pixelsize=13";

If I install media-fonts/unifont-9.0.04 WITHOUT changing font in st or without even recompiling it, it does not crash any more. Why?

Perhaps it's caused by the width or height of the character?

could not be confirmed on the upstream mailing list. Have you been able to reproduce it, jer?
Amadeusz, please retest with current versions in the tree and report.

I no longer use st on Gentoo. Let's consider it non reproducible.
