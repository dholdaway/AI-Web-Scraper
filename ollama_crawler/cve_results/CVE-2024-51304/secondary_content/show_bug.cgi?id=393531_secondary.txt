Another problem with midori r300, this time it compiles but fails to start because it looks for libwebkitgtk-1.0.so.0

Reproducible: Always

PS: Webkit-1.6.1-r301 (which is the available version) provides libwebkitgtk-3.0.so.0

works fine here with just webkit-gtk:3 installed.

try this:

emerge -C midori webkit-gtk
emerge webkit-gtk:3 midori
revdep-rebuild

Can you name a reason why I should try to unmerge webkit? Rebuilding it takes about an hour or more and I don't see why this would help. None of what you said helps.

ldd midori reports all relevant so's at version 1.0, and manually pointing midori to the "correct" 3.0'er ones results in an error from GTK, complaining that

GTK+ 2.x symbols detected. Using GTK 2.x and GTK+3 in the same process is not supported.

Here is emerge info in case that you care

(Sorry if the "None of what you said helps" came across wrongly. I just meant to say that unmerging midori and reemerging it does not help - I had already tried that several times. Neither did revdep-rebuild.)

midori links properly to the new library, so I suspect your webkit-gtk is broken, and it might relink to system copy instead of the one it's building so unemerging it beforehand is necessary to cover that possibility

also output of `which midori` and `lddtree $(which midori)` attached would be helpful to ensure it's not locally built copy in eg. /usr/Local/bin and lddtree output to see what is linked to what

Shame on me, there was a local version overriding portage's midori in my $PATH ! I figured out minutes before you posted, I would have invalidated the bug myself and hoped it into oblivion elsewise. Apologies for that nonsense - I wonder how long I've been using an old local version...
