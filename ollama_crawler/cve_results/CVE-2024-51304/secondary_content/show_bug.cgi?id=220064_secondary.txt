Description

I have this error on running an update:

===
$ sudo emerge --update --deep --newuse world 
!!! The following installed packages are masked:
- dev-util/jam-2.5-r3 (masked by: package.mask)
/usr/portage/profiles/package.mask:
# Ryan Hill <dirtyepic@gentoo.org> (16 Mar 2008)
# Mask for removal on 16 Apr 2008
# upstream unresponsive, replaced by dev-util/ftjam
# Bug #173703

For more information, see the MASKED PACKAGES section in the emerge
man page or refer to the Gentoo Handbook.


emerge: there are no ebuilds to satisfy "virtual/baselayout".
(dependency required by "net-misc/bridge-utils-1.0.6-r3" [installed])
===

I take it the first error message is irrelevant, I am on arch ~ppc64.
Strangely, bridge-utils is installed at the latest version, so I cannot see why
emerge can't just ignore this problem and move on...

I have bridge-utils in my
package.keywords file, so I must be running a ~ppc64 version. also of note is
that other architectures are on bridge-utils version 1.2, whereas this one is
on 1.0.6-r3

addendum: reposted from #215752 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install a ppc64 system
2. add bridge-utils to /etc/portage/package.keywords and install with emerge
3. update world with emerge

Actual Results:  
fails due to missing dependency

Expected Results:  
ignore missing dependency, because the package is already up-to-date.

virtual/baselayout has been removed from the tree entirely. Any issue with an overlay or does a simple sync help, maybe?

I'll try another sync on monday when I get access to the machine. I can't quite see from the bridge-utils ebuild how the two are related.

1.0.6-r3 has been removed from the tree for a few weeks as well.

there is no ~ppc64 version of this ebuild any longer it seems... the 1.2 version does compile fine, not sure I want to stick with it if it's not in testing though.
