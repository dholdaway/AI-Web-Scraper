I after upgrading to spamassassin-3.1.0 I started getting errors in my logs about it not being able to load the Mail-SPF-Query module when I enabled SPF support.  After installing it it seems to have gone away.

The plugin is commented out in 3.1.0 config (/etc/mail/spamassassin/init.pre); the dependency on Mail-SPF-Query is there with USE=spf in >=3.1.0-r1.

if spamassassin 3.1.3 have had SPF use flag and the needed depend for Mail-SPF-Query and a simple sed line that enabled spf plugin in v310.pre it
would make sense for me atleast

seems that this is olso some way what will happend in later versions of spamassassin ebuilds
