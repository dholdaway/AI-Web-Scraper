When emerging a package masked by ~arch keyword, emerge states simply that it's masked. Maybe it would be less ambigous if it stated "marked unstable" or something that is less similar to hard-masked. Just a suggestion ;)

It says exactly why it's masked (either missing keyword or package.mask). Read the message more carefully.
