Description

https://blogs.gentoo.org/ago/2020/07/04/gentoo-tinderbox/

Issue: dev-libs/concurrencykit-0.7.1-r1 fails tests (hang) (HARDENED-SYSTEM).
Discovered on: amd64 (internal ref: hardened_tinderbox)

NOTE:
(HARDENED-SYSTEM) in the summary means that the bug was found on a machine that runs an hardened profile with -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3 and -D_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS (https://www.gentoo.org/support/news-items/2023-01-01-hardening-fortify-assertions.html) but this bug MAY or MAY NOT BE related to the changes related to hardened.
I had to kill the process.

Closing here. Since this issue only ouccurs on your system, I am unable to do anything. Upstream also has no clue, what goes wrong. Neither upstream nor I am able to reproduce this. I recommend, that you mask this package for you USE="test" on your build box.
