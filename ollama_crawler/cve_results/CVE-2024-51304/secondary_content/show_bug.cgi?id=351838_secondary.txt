Trying to do the daily updates (including virtual/blas) I get a digest verification error.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge -av virtual/blas

Actual Results:  

* Digest verification failed:
 * /usr/portage/virtual/blas/blas-1.0.ebuild
 * Reason: Filesize does not match recorded size
 * Got: 582
 * Expected: 579
... done!

Please re-sync your tree and try again. I can't reproduce this. If it still fails, please reopen this bug.
Thanks.
