Advantage Solutions exceeded 2023 financial guidance with solid fourth-quarter performance and expects continued growth in 2024
•2023 consolidated revenues were $4.2 billion, a year-over-year increase of 4.3%, and operating income was $76.2 million. Excluding foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures, revenues increased 6.8%, and Adjusted EBITDA declined 1.7% to $424.3 million but finished ahead of previous guidance.
•Solid performance in the fourth quarter resulted in operating income of $46.2 million and a 2% year-over-year increase in Adjusted EBITDA, which increased by 4.4% excluding foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures. Margin increased 40 basis points to 10.6%.
•Management continued to execute its transformation plan, including the deconsolidation of its European joint venture, the divestiture of its foodservice businesses, and collaborations with Genpact and TCS to outsource certain administrative functions.
•Disciplined capital allocation with debt and share repurchases of $168.2 million and $6.4 million, respectively in 2023.
•Management announced 2024 guidance with expectations for low single-digit growth in consolidated revenues and Adjusted EBITDA.
 
IRVINE, Calif., February 29, 2024 – Advantage Solutions Inc. (NASDAQ: ADV) (“Advantage,” “Advantage Solutions,” the “company,” “we” or “our”), a leading provider of sales and marketing services to consumer goods manufacturers and retailers, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal full year ended December 31, 2023. The results continue to reflect a trendline of improving financial performance and progress executing its transformation strategy.
 
“Our ongoing efforts to strengthen our culture, simplify our operations, improve our financial discipline and enhance our processes as a unified company resulted in a solid fourth-quarter performance,” said Advantage Solutions CEO Dave Peacock. “I am incredibly proud of our team’s success as we delivered full-year revenue growth and Adjusted EBITDA results ahead of expectations. We are committed to continuing to evolve our position in the marketplace and deliver long-term, profitable growth by enhancing our service level with clients and customers.”
 
The company also continues to evaluate its service offerings, consistent with its stated strategy, to ensure more focus on its mission of converting shoppers into buyers for consumer goods companies and retailers. To that end, Advantage Solutions completed additional actions to advance its transformation. Those include: 
 
•Divesture of foodservice businesses: The company divested its foodservice businesses, most notably Waypoint, to Prospect Hill Growth Partners LP on Jan. 31, 2024. As part of the sale, the foodservice businesses were combined with KeyImpact Sales & Systems Inc. to form Acxion Foodservice. The resulting firm creates an innovative go-to-market model to offer clients next-generation services powered by analytics. Advantage received total proceeds of approximately $100 million in mostly cash and an ongoing 7.5% stake in the combined entity. 
 
•Deconsolidation of the European joint venture: Advantage Solutions reduced its stake in Advantage Smollan Limited, a joint venture with the Smollan Group in Europe, from a majority stake under 60% to a minority position of 49.6% in exchange for cash and other considerations. The transaction restructures the European operation by reducing back-office complexities and expenses and simplifies the company’s overall financial reporting. 
 
•Administrative and technology agreements: Advantage Solutions entered into an agreement with Genpact to build an innovative, proprietary digital solution designed to streamline and automate processes behind Advantage BPO and administrative services. Additionally, the company announced a collaboration with Tata Consultancy Services to provide certain IT services.
