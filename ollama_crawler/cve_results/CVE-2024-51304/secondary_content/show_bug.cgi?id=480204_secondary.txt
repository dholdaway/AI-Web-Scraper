I am updating some old box. Everything went ok, until I tryied update udev-197 to udev-200 (or newer).

warning: failed to load external entity "http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/manpages/docbook.xsl"
compilation error: file ./man/custom-man.xsl line 27 element import
xsl:import : unable to load http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/manpages/docbook.xsl

(BTW 
 - why it is dowloading anything in middle of compilation and not at the fetch phase?
- wget http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/manpages/docbook.xsl has no problems download the file
)

Looks like a local problem with installed docbooks. Try reinstalling them, like:

# emerge -C app-text/docbook-xml-dtd app-text/docbook-xsl-stylesheets
# emerge -1 app-text/docbook-xml-dtd:4.2 app-text/docbook-xml-dtd:4.3
# emerge -1 app-text/docbook-xsl-stylesheets

Futhermore this is fixed in >=sys-fs/udev-206 anyway, because they now ship pregenerated manpages and don't regenerate them needlessly
