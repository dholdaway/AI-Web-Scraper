Exhibit 99.1For Immediate ReleaseORIGIN BANCORP, INC. REPORTS EARNINGS FOR FOURTH QUARTER AND 2022 FULL YEARRUSTON, Louisiana (January 25, 2023) - Origin Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq: OBNK) (“Origin” or the “Company”), the holding company for Origin Bank (the “Bank”), today announced net income of $29.5 million, or $0.95 diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, compared to net income of $16.2 million, or $0.57 diluted earnings per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, and compared to net income of $28.3 million, or $1.20 diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2021. Adjusted net income(1) for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, was $30.4 million, or $0.99 adjusted diluted earnings per share(1). Adjusted pre-tax, pre-provision ("adjusted PTPP")(1) earnings was $42.1 million. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $87.7 million, reflecting diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2022, of $3.28 representing a decrease of $1.32, or 28.7%, from diluted earnings per share of $4.60 for the year ended December 31, 2021.“As I look back on the past quarter and 2022 as a whole, I’m very pleased with where we are as a company and how we are operating from a position of strength,” said Drake Mills, chairman, president, and CEO of Origin Bancorp, Inc. “We showed positive financial results for the quarter and the year, bolstered our Texas franchise with the partnership with BTH,  attracted high-quality bankers across our footprint, and significantly grew our loan portfolio while maintaining our conservative credit culture.”(1) Adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted PTPP earnings are non-GAAP financial measures, please see the last few pages of this document for a reconciliation of these alternative financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures. Financial Highlights•The fully tax-equivalent net interest margin (“NIM”) was 3.81% for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, reflecting a 13 basis point increase from the linked quarter and a 75 basis point increase from the quarter ended December 31, 2021. The fully tax-equivalent NIM, adjusted(1), which excludes the net purchase accounting accretion from the net interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, was 3.73%, reflecting a 12 basis point increase from the linked quarter.•Net interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, was $84.7 million, reflecting a $6.2 million, or 7.9% increase, compared to the linked quarter, and a $30.6 million, or 56.4% increase, compared to the prior year quarter.•The Company's annualized returns on average assets and average equity were 1.23% and 12.80%, respectively, for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, compared to 0.70% and 6.86%, respectively, for the linked quarter. •Excluding mortgage warehouse lines of credit, total LHFI were $6.81 billion, reflecting an increase of $383.0 million, or 6.0%, compared to September 30, 2022.•Provision for credit losses was a net expense of $4.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, compared to a net expense of $16.9 million for the linked quarter. The decrease was primarily due to the merger with BTH, which required a Day 1 Current Expected Credit Loss ("CECL") loan provision of $14.9 million during the linked quarter.•The allowance for loan credit losses ("ALCL") to total LHFI, adjusted (2) was 1.28% at December 31, 2022, compared to 1.29% at September 30, 2022. •Total nonperforming LHFI to total LHFI was 0.14% at December 31, 2022, compared to 0.20% at September 30, 2022, and 0.48% at December 31, 2021. The ALCL to nonperforming LHFI was 876.87% at December 31, 2022, compared to 594.11% and 259.35% at the linked quarter and prior year quarter ends, respectively.1The following information was filed by Origin Bancorp, Inc.

 Inside Origin Bancorp, Inc. Attn Chase Anderson's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
The provision for credit losses is charged against earnings in order to maintain our allowance for credit losses, which reflects management's best estimate of life of loan credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio at the balance sheet date, investment security credit losses and our reserve for off-balance sheet lending commitments, which reflects management's best estimate of losses inherent in our legally binding lending-related commitments.



 Financial - Income   Highlight
Interest income earned on commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans contributed $26.4 million and $23.4 million, respectively, of the $68.6 million total increase in interest income earned on LHFI when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Liquidity and Capital Resources Management oversees our liquidity position to ensure adequate cash and liquid assets are available to support our operations and satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demand for loan funding and deposit withdrawals.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
The $5.9 million decrease in limited partnership investment income during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, was primarily due to a net $5.7 million valuation increase in the limited partnership funds during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a net $256,000 valuation decrease recorded during the year ended December 31, 2022.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
The $6.2 million decrease in mortgage banking revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, was primarily due to a $9.8 million decrease in gain on sale of loans sold including MSR origination, primarily due to a 44.9% reduction in origination volume, a 51.2% reduction in sales volume and a 13.5% reduction in sales margin experienced during the year ended December 31, 2022, as well as a $2.0 million impairment on the held for sale GNMA MSR portfolio.
