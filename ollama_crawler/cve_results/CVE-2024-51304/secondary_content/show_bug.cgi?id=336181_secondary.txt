Description

I am using net-mail/fdm-1.5 on ia64 since quite some time, hence I think ~ia64 is appropriate for it. Please note that net-mail/fdm-1.6 did not work for me, hence I do not recommend keywording it.

Reproducible: Always

Sorry, i have no chance to debug problems on ia64. But I've fixed a 'does not repect LDFLAGS' issue on the 1.6 ebuild, maybe this fixes your issue.

What does it mean it doesn't work for you?

-it doesn't compile?
-it segfaults when running
-etc...?

I'd have to try again.
I just have the 1.6 ebuild lying around here, have it masked, and know that I tried to update to 1.6 one or two times and switched back to 1.5 soon after.
It compiled fine, but had some runtime failures.

I do not use fdm anymore, but switched to fetchmail.
