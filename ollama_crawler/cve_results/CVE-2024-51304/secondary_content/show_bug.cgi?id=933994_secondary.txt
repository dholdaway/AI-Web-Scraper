Description


Georgi





          2024-06-10 09:44:09 UTC
        

When the newly introduced nbd is enabled on app-emulation/libvirt-10.0.3-r1 it breaks with the following message:

```
Run-time dependency libiscsi found: NO (tried pkgconfig and cmake)
Run-time dependency libnbd found: NO (tried pkgconfig and cmake)
```

Manually emerging libiscsi and libnbd results in successful compilation.


Reproducible: Always

Note I've mistyped the version in my above comment, it's 10.3.0-r1.

Please share the build.log, emerge --info, and meson-log.txt.

I apologize for not gathering this information right away, I was in a hurry, now I'm unable to reproduce it. If it pop's up again I'll reopen the issue.
