 Inside Axos Financial, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Failure by our Company or Bank to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.



 Other - Other   Highlight
However, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions that could have a material effect on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and our results of operations for the reporting periods.

 Other - Other   Highlight
This guidance allowed an entity to add back to regulatory capital 100% of the impact of the day one CECL transition adjustment and 25% of the subsequent increases to the allowance for credit losses through June 30, 2022.

 Other - Other   Highlight
The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses for its held-for-investment loan and net investment in leases portfolio as well as lending commitments, excluding loans measured at fair value in accordance with applicable accounting standards, which represents management’s estimate of the expected lifetime credit losses on the loans and net investment in leases.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Adjustment of scenario weighting away from the baseline scenario to the adverse scenario should increase the allowance for credit losses on the Company’s held-for-investment loan and net investment in leases portfolio, all else remaining equal.
