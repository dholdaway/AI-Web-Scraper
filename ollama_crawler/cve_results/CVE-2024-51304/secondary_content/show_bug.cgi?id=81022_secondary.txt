Description

I've got a system that's dual-booted Gentoo 2004.3 and Fedora Core 3. I loaded Fedora first, and created its partitions during the install. When I boot Gentoo, I get the following message when I try to "fsck" the Fedora-built ext3 partitions:

DreamSong root # fsck /dev/hda3
fsck 1.35 (28-Feb-2004)
e2fsck 1.35 (28-Feb-2004)
fsck.ext2: Filesystem has unsupported feature(s) (/)
e2fsck: Get a newer version of e2fsck!
DreamSong root # 

I haven't booted up the Fedora side recently to see what version of e2fsprogs it has. Nor have I checked Portage to see if a later one is available there. The Fedora partitions seem to mount OK, though I'm reluctant to touch them now. I do need to edit the Fedora-side "grub.conf" occasionally, though, since I did the Fedora install first and that's where the GRUB bootloader came from. :)

hmm, it looks like 1.36 prob wont do it either ... i'm just guessing, but it's probably this patch that does it:
e2fsprogs-enable-resize.patch:
+#if 1
+   param.s_feature_compat |= EXT2_FEATURE_COMPAT_RESIZE_INODE;
+#endif

if this is the case, then we wont be adding this kind of stuff to our ebuild ... it would have to come from upstream (e2fsprogs.sf.net)

The new e2fsprog-1.36 does work for me regarding running e2fsck on partitions shared with Fedora Core 3 in my multiboot system. No need to patch it for that anymore.

Yep ... 1.36 did the trick here as well. So ... is there a "fixed in next release" category? :)

BTW, the only reason I'm dual-booted with FC3 is that the place where I work "encourages" RHCE certification.
