A bit more information.  In order to even get this far with those two packages, I had to copy two .la files from /usr/lib64 to /usr, otherwise the compile was looking for them.  They are: libatspi.la and libatk.la .

There should be no such *.la files for years now. Not sure what's up with your system there.
