such as '-*' and "-amd64 keyword" should be mentioned in the MASKED PACKAGES section.  some is described in the keywords (~x86) paragraphs, but it isn't complete.

there's no point in mentioning -* really since it really doesnt do anything

KEYWORDS="-* x86" is the samething as KEYWORDS="x86"

emerge man page has about a 10 line section on KEYWORDS already.
