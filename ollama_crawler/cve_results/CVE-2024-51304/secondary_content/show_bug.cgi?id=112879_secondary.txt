Description


Garrett Cooper





          2005-11-17 22:24:01 UTC
        

Alsa claims that the device doesn't exist (through programs such as xmms,
mplayer, etc) even though using native oss applications or plugins allows sound
to be output to the device under test.

Also, running mplayer periodically without configuring alsa allows for sound
output as well as cat'ing to /dev/dsp (as regular user or root).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:




sprsd gcooper # lspci | grep -i cry && uname -a
0000:02:09.0 Multimedia audio controller: Cirrus Logic CS 4614/22/24
[CrystalClear SoundFusion Audio Accelerator] (rev 01)
Linux sprsd 2.6.12.5 #2 SMP Sun Nov 13 16:48:58 PST 2005 i686 Intel(R)
Pentium(R) 4 CPU 2.40GHz GenuineIntel GNU/Linux
