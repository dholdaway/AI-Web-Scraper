Description


Nico Schlömer





          2008-03-03 15:22:03 UTC
        

The file

/usr/share/kde4/services/desktop.desktop

is missing at the kde 4.0.1 (and i guess also 4.0.0) install which results, for example, in my pager not working as expected (such as not getting a response when hitting 'Configure Desktops...').

Creating an empty file at the above location fixed it for me.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start kde, have a pager ready
2. right click on the pager
3. click on "Configure Desktops..."

... and watch how nothing happens

Works for me, with kde-base/kwin-4.0.2 installed...

ingmar@lime ~ $ paludis -o /usr/kde/4.0/share/kde4/services/desktop.desktop
* /usr/kde/4.0/share/kde4/services/desktop.desktop
    kde-base/kwin-4.0.2::installed
        /usr/kde/4.0/share/kde4/services/desktop.desktop
