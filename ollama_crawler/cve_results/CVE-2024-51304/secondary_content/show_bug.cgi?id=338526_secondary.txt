Since kdevelop has moved to git repositories , old svn repository doesn't work anymore , thus i provided a new one for helping those guys like me , doing KDE devels.

Reproducible: Always

Those ebuids are taken from kde overlay and they were there for ages. No need to cherry-pick ebuilds from there and attach them at bugzilla.
