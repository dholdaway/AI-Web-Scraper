Description

The comment in the ebuild and the checks in configure.ac suggest that ares and threads cannot both be enabled, but the REQUIRED_USE additionally forces one of them to be on.  If I change "^^ ( ares threads )" to "ares? ( !threads )" curl will successfully build with neither flag set.

The ebuild should either allow USE="-ares -threads" or the comments should be changed to correspond with the code.

Reproducible: Always
