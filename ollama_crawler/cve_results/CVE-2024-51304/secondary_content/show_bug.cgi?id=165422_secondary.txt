Description


Diego Elio Pettenò (RETIRED)






          2007-02-05 10:18:28 UTC
        

Compiling with recent GCC versions fails:

dataview.cpp: In member function ‘QString DataView::__writeTaskInfo(FlightTask*)’:
dataview.cpp:110: warning: format not a string literal and no format arguments
dataview.cpp: In member function ‘void DataView::setFlightData()’:
dataview.cpp:264: error: cast from ‘Flight*’ to ‘int’ loses precision

and this is a serious failure: even if older version of GCC compiled the code, it wouldn't have worked as intended.

I've changed the marking to -amd64 for this reason.

HTH,
Diego
