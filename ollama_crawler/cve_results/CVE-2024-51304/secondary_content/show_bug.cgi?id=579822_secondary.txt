I recently migrated to systemd using the plasma5 systemd profile. After remerging world, cups turned out not to have the systemd use flag set (I did not have systemd as a global flag). I think it should be, so that the global flag is unnecessary and this is covered by the profile.

profiles/targets/systemd/make.defaults already has systemd as a global use flag set by profile.   Check your local files in /etc/portage/ as you probably are overriding that.

Maybe cups isn't in your world. Was it actually rebuilt with the world remerge?

Checked, no override found.

It is (now?).

In any case, I unset the make.conf use flag and tried to re-emerge and the problem did not pop up again. I'm closing as WORKSFORME. Sorry for the noise.
