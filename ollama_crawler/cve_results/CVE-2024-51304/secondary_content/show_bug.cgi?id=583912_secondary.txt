Qupzilla works absolutely fine, as long as you have these exact flags in your /etc/portage/make.conf:

qt5 gstreamer -qt4

But if you don't happen to have any keywords, or you have the "multimedia" keyword, then QtWebKit will build against the "wrong" library and be unable to play back YouTube videos.

It doesn't pull in or suggest all the GStreamer plugins and libraries that you need in order to actually watch anything. Also, without very specific USE flags indicating otherwise, it defaults to Qt4 instead of Qt5, even if you have Qt5 installed. The application works better with Qt5, so I think it would make more sense for Qt4 to be used as a fallback if you don't have Qt5. Instead of the way it is now.

I'm not sure if this would be considered a bug, and I apologize if it's not considered one, but someone told me to report it because it causes a lot of confusion and headache for anyone trying to emerge QupZilla who doesn't know exactly what they're doing with QtWebKit and GStreamer. I detailed my experiences here:

http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/gentoo-87/qupzilla-1-8-9-won%27t-playback-youtube-videos-even-with-all-the-gstreamer-plugins-installed-4175580381/

So I've already got this resolved for myself. I'm just basically here asking if there's anything you guys can do to make this easier for other people that might run into the same problems later.

I don't think there's anything we can/should do here in the short term. Ideally we should stabilize qupzilla-2.x as soon as possible (after qt 5.6.x is stabilized) since it doesn't suffer from either "problems" (it is qt5 only and uses qtwebengine/ffmpeg instead of qtwebkit/gstreamer).

Any other "solutions" that come to mind right now involve changes to USE flags and/or dependencies, which would require a revision bump and waiting 30 days to stabilize. Also note that the description of USE=gstreamer for qtwebkit clearly says that it "enables HTML5 audio/video support". It's even enabled by default in qtwebkit-4.8.x
