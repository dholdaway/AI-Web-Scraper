Description


Carsten Lohrke (RETIRED)






          2004-01-13 06:06:32 UTC
        

1. part 8 - "Apache and Squirrelmail Webmail" isn't really desktop stuff and should find a better place.

2. There should be a sentence or two about how to configure /etc/hosts properly.
To quote caleb: "It's not ignorant, but KDE does require a properly configured /etc/hosts to function happily. The back end uses a lot of sockets for communication, and if KDE can't figure out who "localhost" is then it slows things down immensely."

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
2.
3.

3. Part 2 Installing XFree86 discusses nvidia cards, but doesn't mention opengl-update. Then there is the "Direct Rendering Howto" discussing XFree/drm. I think this stuff should be merged to a X guide.

Could at least point two find its way into some doc? There are dozens of threads in forums.g.o, asking "why is my KDE so slow".

In what way is the description in the installation instructions flawed?

Afaik the Gentoo Installation Instructions contain the correct information about setting up /etc/hosts. If this isn't the case, please reopen.

But don't reopen this if you want to say "please add this information in this or that guide as well", I'm not going to duplicate documentation, otherwise future updates would just give me more and more headaches.

Sorry Sven, I lost track of this bug once again. :(

Yes, it may be a bit of duplication, but why should users know, that they have to setup /etc/hosts properly to give kde a speed boost? I thought about a single sentence (and maybe a second one for the ide/dma/hdparm issue), mentioning this and linking to the correct documentation part.

There are many posts in the forums that can be resolved if people read the documentation truely. I might be tempted to convert this bug to "Add a Troubleshooting section in the KDE configuration guide" in which this is covered, but I don't want any duplication throughout the documentation itself so that people who follow the instructions closely don't get the feeling that they're reading things in stereo :)

>I might be tempted to convert this bug to "Add a Troubleshooting section in the KDE configuration guide"

This is exactly what I thought about. Your goal to keep the documentation as clear as possible is a valuable one of course.
