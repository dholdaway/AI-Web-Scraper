In toolchain.eclass it informs the user to revdep-rebuild --library <old gcc
libstdc++.so >  However, revdep-rebuild doens't have a --library parameter
anymore, it uses --soname.

Er, FuzzyRay has informed me that in 0.2.1 it will be --library, and --soname
will be kept for backwards compatability.  Maybe put in both...not sure what the
best choice is here.

I think the easiest way to resolve this is for me to patch revdep-rebuild in 
stable to accept --library as well as --soname.

gentoolkit-0.2.0-r3 now in the tree. revdep-rebuild will now process --library
