Lets imagine an ebuild where besides the information about package web page we
have a link to freshmeat web page for this package.
eg: FRESHMEAT_URL="http://freshmeat.net/projects/porthole/"
It would greatly improve portage coolnes, and many portage specific utilities
could take advantage of it ( just use your imagination here ).


Reproducible: Always

metadata.xml can already support this. You just need to convince devs that 
it's worth doing, which should be done on the gentoo-dev@gentoo.org mailing 
list.
