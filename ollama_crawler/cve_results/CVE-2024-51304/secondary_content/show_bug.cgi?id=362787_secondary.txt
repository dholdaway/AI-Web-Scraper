Description

          2011-04-09 22:56:42 UTC
        

The above error means something went wrong on at least one phase of compilation before that part. Examining the logs, I noticed the following:

checking whether we are using the GNU C compiler...
configure: error: in `/var/tmp/portage/sys-devel/gcc-4.5.2/work/build/fixincludes':
configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
See `config.log' for more details.
(...)
configure: error: in `/var/tmp/portage/sys-devel/gcc-4.5.2/work/build/i686-pc-linux-gnu/libmudflap':
configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
See `config.log' for more details.
(...)

  Entering those directories and looking at the respective config.log (config-fixincludes.log and config-libmudflap.log attached) in each, I verified the error was about unresolved symbol for at least 'clock_gettime' and 'clock_getres'. I've read there is a flag you issue for the compiler that is needed (-lrt) in order to have these symbols accessible.

  As a dummy attempt, I tried just reproducing the config.log's command line, and for my surprise, both failed programs now succeeded. The first line that has changed on the config.log was this:

--- errored log:

configure:3223: i686-pc-linux-gnu-gcc --version >&5
i686-pc-linux-gnu-gcc (Gentoo 4.4.3-r2 p1.2) 4.4.3

  Of course, we can see that it is actually using my current gcc version. It seems that, inside the sandbox, the compiler can not count on that -lrt library at all. I have already tried resetting the CFLAGS, MAKEOPTS=-j1, LDFLAGS, but I could not even change the error. I am almost out of ideas on how to solve this problem... I did not try yet to remove the 'sandbox' feature, as I am afraid it could lead me to an unresponsive system. I am almost out of options here.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.emerge -a sys-devel/gcc
2.say yes
3.wait some time
Actual Results:  
Emerge fails

Expected Results:  
Emerge succeeds and gcc-4.5.2 gets in the list of gcc-config, possibly removing 4.4.3 one.

I have recently made an emerge --sync from a box that was last synched more than a year ago.

The actual date of the last emerge is not a year older, but around september/2010, which is nevertheless a lot of time anyway. :)
Please give me some time while I prepare the logs to attach to the bug report.

This is the log which shows errors from the fixincludes directory.

Emerge's build log.

Please ignore messages showing errors on PWD. I just run emerge when I was still into the directory where the temporary files were. This did not change the error message from the several times I compiled (most of them I moved out of the /var/tmp/portage directory).

that libgomp.so is supposed to be linked against librt.so itself.  your configure output is showing things go wrong earlier:
checking for clock_gettime... yes

that should of course say:
checking for clock_gettime... no
checking for clock_gettime in -lrt... yes

so attach the config.log from the libgomp subdirs

          2011-04-11 12:03:24 UTC
        

I was able to compile (using -aB in order for it not to enter the system if successfull but yet compile everything) if I specified:
USE="-mudflap -nls -nptl -openmp" emerge -aB gcc

It still points towards libgomp not being linked against -lrt.

What I don't understand now is why gcc-4.5.2 is not masked for me if it was supposed to be masked and I did not explicitly unmask it. I have no package.keywords not package.accept_keywords. My previous gcc version was 4.4.3 as of september 2010.

I noticed here, the answer for 'looking for config_gettime' results to 'yes' as well.

Ah! By the way, I have already tried:
LDFLAGS=-lrt emerge sys-devel/gcc

It seems LDFLAGS is simply ignored as the same error ocurred. Anyway if that worked, I would expect larger binaries uselessly (is --as-needed still a default?)

Here's the make.conf from the box I am working on this issue.

Please note: Although there are these ricer flags on CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS, I have already tried with them (both at the same time) commented out, tried also MAKE_OPTS as -j3, j2 and j1.

It seems, if I disable openmp (USE=-openmp) the whole thing works out. I will confirm that information in a while.

you're using ~x86, so installing gcc-4.5.2 shouldnt be a surprise.

try running the command in question:
$ echo 'main(){return clock_gettime();}' > conftest.c
$ gcc -B/usr/i686-pc-linux-gnu/bin/ -B/usr/i686-pc-linux-gnu/lib/ \
 -isystem /usr/i686-pc-linux-gnu/include \
 -isystem /usr/i686-pc-linux-gnu/sys-include \
 -o conftest -g -march=native -pipe -DSQLITE_HAVE_ISNAN -O2 -pthread conftest.c

if that passes, add the flags "-v -Wl,--verbose -Wl,-M" and post the full output as an attachment

conftest.c with lotsa verbose options' output

Here is the output of the command:
gcc -B/usr/i686-pc-linux-gnu/bin/ -B/usr/i686-pc-linux-gnu/lib/  -isystem /usr/i686-pc-linux-gnu/include  -isystem /usr/i686-pc-linux-gnu/sys-include  -o conftest -g -march=native -pipe -DSQLITE_HAVE_ISNAN -O2 -pthread conftest.c -v -Wl,--verbose -Wl,-M

Just a heads up: I was able to compile the other directories once I moved directly to them and compiled. Of course, during emerge phase, the compiler used is the half-done gcc-4.5.2. As in the sandbox (emerge FEATURE), I expect the environment not to be the same as when I just run the plain command using my 4.4.3 already working compiler.
With 'other directories' I mean the failed fixincludes and libmudflap. Analysing the configure scripts, I noticed I always use gcc 4.4.3 when I run commands from commandline; when emerge does the configures, it really finds the 4.5.2 compiler.
The detailed comments of this 'heads up' are in the first comment, at the point where I start with 'As a dummy attempt'.

your glibc looks like it is screwed up:

libgomp.so.1 needed by /lib/libpthread.so.0
found libgomp.so.1 at /usr/lib/gcc/i686-pc-linux-gnu/4.4.3/libgomp.so.1
librt.so.1 needed by /usr/lib/gcc/i686-pc-linux-gnu/4.4.3/libgomp.so.1
found librt.so.1 at /lib/librt.so.1

libpthread.so should *not* be linked against libgomp.so.

that make.conf you posted is not even close to the `emerge --info` you posted originally.  what is going on ?  did you run it on the wrong machine, or are you purposefully hiding info from us ?

further, that LDFLAGS=-lgomp is simply stupid.  you screwed up your system thus you get to fix it.  please dont waste our time with this kind of crap.

  Of course I did not do that 'emerge --info vs make.conf' in purpose. As I said several times, I've changed lotsa options in order to try and find some combination that could work with that. When I took emerge --info I really had the lines CFLAGS commented out, thus the different output. In order to clear that out, I have this combo command, which shows you the same machine in the emerge --info with the options updated:

You know you could use better words, other than 'crap', or 'waste our time', 'screwed your system'. I am not testing you nor no one of the other people who voluntarily help maintain gentoo. I didn't.. I don't know what I have done to screw the system up. I mean to find it out but still I thought I could get some directions from the people around gentoo bugzilla.

Despite all your pity tongue and inappropriate words, you gave me some directions, for what I am thankful. I just hope one day you rethink your ways on judging other people, or at least does not assume they are against you at sight. Last, I wish someone else attended to this request so I did not have to read such rude arguments.

It seems the problem was resolved. I'm not sure if all this was really needed but the steps were:

- remove -lgomp from LDFLAGS in make.conf
emerge glibc
emerge --oneshot libtool
emerge gcc

Then voila, it worked like a charm.
