At above URL, issuing the command as per the docs:

grub-install --root-directory=/boot /dev/hda

Will result in grub being installed in /boot/boot/grub.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Change the amd64 documentation, --root-directory=/boot should be --root-directory=/

Actual Results:  
It worked.

Expected Results:  
Install grub into /boot, not /boot.

/boot/boot should be a symlink to /boot, so /boot/boot/grub = /boot/grub.  grub cannot determine mount points, so the --root-directory=/boot is necessary for people who have /boot on a seperate partition - otherwise grub would look on the wrong partition for the image files.  the symlink keeps things simple.

The command is correct

Didn't mean to just put "works" :)

The command doesn't hurt as per Ryan's comment. For people with separate boot partitions it is vital, but for others it's just redundant.
