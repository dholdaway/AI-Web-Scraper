Here is a patch to sys-devel/crossdev-wrappers-20090616 for :

.1 Report effective number or .la and .pc corrected files
.2 strip_path function is not used
.3 bashify re_safe to avoid a pipe/fork
.4 avoid a possibily long and slow find in $CROSS_ROOT/usr/lib, but track files contained in package
.5 add a dependency on app-portage/portage-utils
.6 Fix escape
.7 Fix sed error report

Reproducible: Always

ive completely rewritten cross-fix-root and so your patch doesnt really apply at all.  i dont think any of the issues you raised exist anymore.
