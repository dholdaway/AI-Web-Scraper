Created attachment 170192 [details]
GDGraph-histogram-1.1.ebuild

I can't help with g-cpan but i can attach an ebuild for GDGraph-histogram.

Shouldn't it be "Compiling source in /var/tmp/portage/dev-perl/GDGraph-histogram-1.1/work/GDGraph-histogram-1.1"?

ebuild generated by g-cpan 0.16.0 works perfectly.

But if it does go into the tree, it needs a bit of makefile.PL patching to install the histogram.pl from scripts/
