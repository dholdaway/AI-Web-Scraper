infhfg00@localhost ~ $ equery depends gtk+-1.2*

[ Searching for packages depending on gtk+-1.2*... ]
app-text/ghostscript-afpl-8.53
...

but

infhfg00@localhost ~ $ equery depends gtk+-1* does not report anything.

I think this would be very useful.

Reproducible: Always

At least in gentoolkit-0.3.0 and probably earlier, you'll need to use either an actual regular expression (with the --full-regex flag) OR a valid atom to do version expansion. Notice that even emerge doesn't do version expansion if it's not a proper atom. equery list, depends, and similar can all accept the same input as emerge (but you don't need the explicit '=').

$ emerge -qp gtk+-2*
!!! 'gtk+-2*' is not a valid package atom.
!!! Please check ebuild(5) for full details.
$ emerge -qp =x11-libs/gtk+-2*
[ebuild   R   ] x11-libs/gtk+-2.16.6 
$ equery -q list x11-libs/gtk+-2*
x11-libs/gtk+-2.16.6
