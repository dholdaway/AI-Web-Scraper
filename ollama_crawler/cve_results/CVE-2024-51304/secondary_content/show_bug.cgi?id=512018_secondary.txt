build log

On my hardened ~amd64 machine I see the following test failure for p7zip. I combed through the logs and it does not seem to be hardened related.

For me it works. And I don't see anything in your logs which could help. Could you attach the 7za433_7zip_lzma.x archive?

It's still more than one megabyte in compressed form, so here is an external link: http://users.minet.uni-jena.de/~m6oema2/7za433_7zip_lzma.x.xz .

I think it is hardened related as I cannot reproduce it on a non-hardened system and second it only happens for the executable archive.

This one was probably missed when reassigning in the past.

All tests pass for me with app-arch/p7zip-17.05-r1, can you retry please?

I cannot reproduce the failure anymore. However my system configuration changed since then. It may still be there, but if we can't detect it it may as well not be, so I'm closing this.
