Description


Alexander Jenisch





          2005-12-14 23:24:05 UTC
        

whenever i try to emerge something and i get a "package is masked" error, i'd
like to see, WHAT i do have to unmask to install it. and more so, i'd like to
have an option to show an additional info line, like "Masked As: ~x86" or
something, without having to look into the ebuild.

 # emerge -pv =sys-apps/baselayout-1.12.0_pre11-r3

These are the packages that I would merge, in order:

Calculating dependencies
!!! All ebuilds that could satisfy "=sys-apps/baselayout-1.12.0_pre11-r3" have
been masked.
!!! One of the following masked packages is required to complete your request:
- sys-apps/baselayout-1.12.0_pre11-r3 (masked by: ~x86 keyword)

For more information, see MASKED PACKAGES section in the emerge man page or
refer to the Gentoo Handbook.
