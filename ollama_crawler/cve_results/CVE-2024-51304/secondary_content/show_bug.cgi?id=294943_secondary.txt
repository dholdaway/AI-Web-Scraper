Many people wants to see correctly rendered web pages and files names with any characters, this ebuild gives such ability.

I tested with x11-base/xorg-x11 installed, will check without it later.

All ebuilds are also available at http://pub.nikoli.msk.ru/portage-overlay/

The new media-fonts/noto package covers pretty much all of this, except for the Old Slavonic. But please double check, and see if we need to add any more fonts for total coverage.
