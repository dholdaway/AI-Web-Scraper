Expected Results:  
Downloaded and executed the install file

The request was made behind a firewall, but port 80 isn't blocked. The file was partially downloaded on a first attempt to install the package, but the connection was closed and subsequent tries were futile (issued the output reported). The portage tree was updated (28/May/2007).
