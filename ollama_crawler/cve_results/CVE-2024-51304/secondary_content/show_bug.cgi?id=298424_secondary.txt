It's a bug. Shouldn't happen:

emerge: there are no ebuilds built with USE flags to satisfy ">=x11-base/xorg-server-1.7[-minimal]".
!!! One of the following packages is required to complete your request:
- x11-base/xorg-server-1.7.3.901-r1 (Change USE: -minimal)
(dependency required by "media-libs/mesa-7.7" [ebuild])
(dependency required by "@world" [argument])

as it was working flawlessly with USE=minimal.

Reproducible: Always

You appear to have media-libs/mesa unmasked but not x11-base/xorg-server-1.7.

In the only xorg-server-1.7 ebuild, USE=-minimal pulls in three packages critical to media-libs/mesa (notably DRI support):

    !minimal? (
        >=x11-proto/xf86driproto-2.1.0
        >=x11-proto/dri2proto-2.1
        >=x11-libs/libdrm-2.3.0
    )

So whatever you think USE=minimal should mean, it only draws in whatever mesa needs to support DRI.
