The homepage contains a very useful hint to prevent duplicate bug submissions:

When searching for duplicate bugs, closed bugs or using multiple search terms, prefix your entry with 'ALL' (not suffix).

However, if people bookmark the bug submission form, they will never see this when using the inbuilt search "Step 1 of 3 - has your bug already been reported?" How about copying the above text into this step?

Reproducible: Always

The search now lists closed bugs. No change needed.
