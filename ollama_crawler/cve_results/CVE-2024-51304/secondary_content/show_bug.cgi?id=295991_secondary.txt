I feel the network script (newnet) should be more verbose about what it is doing.

Currently it just displays:
"Starting network" and "Setting default route ..."

It would be nice though if it could also display which interfaces it is setting up for what addresses using what method (ifconfig/iproute) and so on.

Reproducible: Always

You can always add this to /etc/conf.d/network

export EINFO_VERBOSE=yes

Does Roy's suggestion above give you the information you need?

Thanks,

Yes, that information is useful. I think it should be enabled by default.

I am against making this the default behavior. There are instances where I might have a junior admin restarting a server that does not need to have this info. It is one of them one can enable and disable, all comes down to choice.
