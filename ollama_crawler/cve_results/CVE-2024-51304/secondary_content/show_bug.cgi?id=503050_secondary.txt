emerge --info

>=sys-apps/man-pages-3.57

When emerging man-pages, the install section of the makefile attempts to install the same file twice. The second occurrence gets a different name with a non-displayed character. Two files appear that appear identical as below.

cd /var/tmp/portage/sys-apps/man-pages-3.57/work/man-pages-3.57/man3/
ls -ilb NAN.3 
557519047 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 20 Jan 24 11:06 NAN.3
ls -ilb NAN.3*
557519047 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 20 Jan 24 11:06 NAN.3
557519047 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 20 Jan 24 11:06 NAN.3

i'm not seeing this.  the man tarball only has one NAN.3 file and it only installs it once.

does it fail every time you try to emerge it ?

Yes it is always repeatable. The tarball only ever had one NAN.3 file. It is the install section of the makefile that appears to cause the issue.

The problem appears to have disappeared on the latest ebuilds.
