I have recently installed gnome-shell 3.2.0-r1 from the gnome overlay, and overall, I'm impressed. I had to file a bug or two before getting everything to run, but that's to be expected.

However, on occasion, when searching for an application from the "Activities" view, gnome-shell will hang in its entirety. I *think* this happens after installing an application that merges a .desktop file, but I'm not too sure. However, when this happens, I have to send a SIGKILL to gnome-shell, otherwise I'm unable to even terminate the process.

On #gentoo-desktop, I was asked to debug gnome-shell, which I did. Find attached stacktraces for all threads (gnome-shell.gdb), and stdout+stderr of gnome-shell in a single file (gnome-shell.output). In gnome-shell.output, you should also find the output of the call to gjs_dumpstack().

PS: please disregard the warning about the pidgin extension, I'm aware that it doesn't work, but I've tried this with and without the extension: no changes whatsoever.

Are you still experiencing the problem with gnome-shell-3.2.1 and gnome-desktop-3.2.1 (and the rest of the gnome overlay packages updated to 3.2.1)?

No, I have indeed not run into this problem again since updating to 3.2.1.
