Description

Hi,

Attached is a new ebuild for JThread. From the homepage:

The JThread package provides some classes to make use of threads easy on
different platforms. The classes are actually rather simple wrappers around
existing thread implementations.

I suggest this to be placed in dev-libs/jthread

This package is required by another, JRTPLIB, which I'll post the link to here
after I created a bug for it.

The JRTPLIB ebuild is in bug 106977.

The ebuild header is missing, see
