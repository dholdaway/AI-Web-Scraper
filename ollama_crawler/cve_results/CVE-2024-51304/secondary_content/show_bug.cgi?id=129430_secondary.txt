checking for XRRUpdateConfiguration in -lXrandr... yes
checking for X11/extensions/Xrandr.h... yes
checking for xcomposite >= 1.0 xfixes xdamage xrender... Requested 'xcomposite >= 1.0' but version of Xcomposite is 0.3
configure: error: Library requirements (xcomposite >= 1.0 xfixes xdamage xrender) not met; consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if your libraries are in a nonstandard prefix so pkg-config can find them.
