Don't restrict bugs without any reason. Just leave the checkboxes alone.

Gnome team please advise about GTK+.

Sounds like they have a theme selected but no engine for that theme.

I couldn't find a single mention of clearlooks in grip sources, and it worked fine here without gtk-engines installed. Closing as WORKSFORME.
