Found https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=256793 While researching this in #gentoo, which appeared to be related, the same assert that failed in the attached log is noted in https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=256793#c3 and https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=256793#c4 "Removing assert gets me the desktop, currently typing this in Firefox.".

Are you running Vulkan (Raddeon) or Iris graphics?

No, I have intel graphics. Also, this hasn't happened in a while, and I see I'm using 1.7 now. Feel free to close unless you have discovered a use case where this still persists.

sounds good to me, let me know if it happens again (new bug, but reference this bug).
