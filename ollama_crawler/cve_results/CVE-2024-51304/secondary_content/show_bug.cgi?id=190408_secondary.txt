Description

I've been said by some ebuild to launch python-updater. There is always some problem with the tree graph or some versions. With revdep-rebuild, i can mess with ~root/.rev* and more or less reinstall the package myself. But i can't find the files for python-updater. Here's an exemple of a failure.

(I say 'almost' because i haven't tried them all yet, but i've never started a python-updater that do something)

Reproducible: Always

These are the packages that would be merged, in order:

Calculating dependencies /
!!! Multiple versions within a single package slot have been
!!! pulled into the dependency graph:

('ebuild', '/', 'dev-python/sip-4.6', 'merge') (no parents)

('ebuild', '/', 'dev-python/sip-4.7', 'merge') pulled in by
  ('ebuild', '/', 'dev-python/PyQt-3.17.3', 'merge')

It may be possible to solve this problem by using package.mask to
prevent one of those packages from being selected. However, it is also
possible that conflicting dependencies exist such that they are
impossible to satisfy simultaneously. If such a conflict exists in the
dependencies of two different packages, then those packages can not be
installed simultaneously.

For more information, see MASKED PACKAGES section in the emerge man page
or refer to the Gentoo Handbook.

i keep on 'emerge -C' the packages that block the python-updater, but there's still some problems. i've removed ~12 packages already, and it still dont work.

So run it with --ignore-versions.

bug #190473  is not actually a dup of this; any way, python-updater and other things may work better if emerge was defaulted with "--with-bdeps=y"

Yes you can run it with --ignore-versions.
The reason for this is that old e-builds are deleted from the tree, which means that if the stage3 is a little old, then the portage tree doesn't contain the e-builds for all installed packages.
So, for each package that isn't found, emerge the latest version.
