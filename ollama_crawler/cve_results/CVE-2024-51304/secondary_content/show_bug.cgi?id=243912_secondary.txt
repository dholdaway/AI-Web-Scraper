Description


Diego Elio Pettenò (RETIRED)

I'm filing this bug (from a template, mind you) because the ebuild I'm reporting it against failed to build once I removed my /usr/bin/{gcc,cc,c++,c99} binaries. This means that the ebuild is relying on gcc or cc as compiler, while it should use "$(tc-getCC)" so that user choices are respected, and cross-compiling works as intended.

This usually comes down to one of these tasks:

- use emake CC="$(tc-getCC)" for building, to ovewrite make's CC variable (defaults to "cc", some upstream rewrites it);
- the above plus replacing explicit "gcc" (or similar) calls with $(CC) so that the variable is actually respected;
- tc-export CC in src_compile before eventual econf.

For C++, you'd have to replace CC with CXX everywhere above, of course.

If your package is a special case on this, please let me know.

Thanks,
Diego

I deleted the files you said, and it worked fine for me.  It seems to pick things up correctly in the environment.
