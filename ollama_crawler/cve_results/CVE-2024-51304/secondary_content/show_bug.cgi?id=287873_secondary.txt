I installed the New Gentoo 10 livecd on usb drive. No root device detected when boot into the usb drive.

Reproducible: Always

explain the process you took to add the iso contents to your usb drive. Also paste 'lspci' output and confirm your bios supports booting from a usb device.

I use the process of "http://wiki.sabayonlinux.org/index.php?title=HOWTO:_Bootable_USB_with_persistance"
The same usbdrive and pc is working ok.

When the Gentoo 10 livecd boot up no usb drive, only cdrom is searched.

I burn a dvd and the livecd works.

for those of you that have booted the livedvd on a usb stick and it didn't work but you know for sure it works with others, should know that the method of allowing the iso image to boot from a usb device is not supported on all bioses.

You will need to use old methods as described in http://wiki.sabayonlinux.org/index.php?title=HOWTO:_Bootable_USB_with_persistance or others which don't use syslinux's isohybrid utility to boot the Ten LiveDVD from a usb device. 

Hope this helps clarify why it doesn't work for your hardware.

I've got the same issue, but if I booted gentoo64, it works (but then there's no appropriate video mode found.

I tried this image. Now the USB stick is found, but there's a crash at the moment that X starts. With gentoo64, again, there are no fb modes available during early boot...

post 'lspci'

The new revised iso has been tested on nvidia 9800GTX and nvidia 7950X2 on my end. I need others to confirm it works on their cards. There will be a final revision coming this week.

There are new iso images located at:
http://bouncer.gentoo.org/fetch/gentoo-10.1-livedvd/x86/    [x86]
http://bouncer.gentoo.org/fetch/gentoo-10.1-livedvd/amd64/  [amd64]

Report back, keep in mind even if your system does boot from a usb device, it doesn't mean it will support hybrid isos.

I also tested here with 10.1 and it worked as expected. I am going to close the bug, please reopen if it does not work for you.
