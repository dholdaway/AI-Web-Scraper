I followed the guide http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/ipv6.xml#doc_chap2, section "Hurricane Electric". The tunnel works as expected. How do I configure openrc to do this on startup? I tried the tunnel_ configuration options, but was not able to set my ipv6 address. The 6to4 options look roughly like what I want, but I need to configure local and remote tunnel address.

I'm using oldnet at the moment, but I'm willing to switch to newnet, given a good howto or something like that.

Robin documented how to do that in his post: http://robbat2.livejournal.com/235829.html

Only oldnet is going to work, not newnet.

Given that this is not really a bug but more a support request (that should have gone through the Forums instead), I'd close this with WORKSFORME. If you need help, please use the Forums in the future; if there is really a bug here, feel free to reopen.

Well, it's strange to find Gentoo documentation explaining how to set this up but not how to do it in /etc/conf.d/net. It would be good to improve the documentation or add another example to net.example.

Thanks a lot for the link.
