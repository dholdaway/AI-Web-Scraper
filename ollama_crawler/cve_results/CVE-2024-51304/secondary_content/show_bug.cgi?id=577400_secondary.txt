Description


Petros





          2016-03-14 15:28:04 UTC
        

evolution-data-server compilation failed because ld could not find soup-gnome library.

*error:
/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/5.3.0/../../../../x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/bin/ld: error: cannot find -lsoup-gnome-2.4
*

Whether compling with LTO or not, didn't change anything. The solution was to manually emerge net-libs/libsoup-gnome.

It builds fine for me without libsoup-gnome... at least with gcc49 without LTO
