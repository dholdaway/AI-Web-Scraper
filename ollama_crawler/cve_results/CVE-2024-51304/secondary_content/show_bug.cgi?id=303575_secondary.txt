Description


Jesse Tijnagel





          2010-02-05 13:27:47 UTC
        

If i re-emerge emerge gnome-base/gvfs it's configuration reports:

...
# INTLTOOL_MAKEFILE

gvfs configuration summary:

        gio module directory : /usr/lib64/gio/modules/usr/lib64/gio/modules

        FTP/HTTP/WebDAV support       yes
        ObexFTP support               yes
	Samba support:	              yes
	FUSE support:                 yes
        CDDA support:                 no
...

But when i try ftp in Nautilus i get an alert: "Nautilus cannot handle "ftp" locations."

And when i try in console: gvfs-mount ftp://user@ftp.server.net i get: "Error mounting location: Location is not mountable"


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

Actual Results:  
Nautilus and other gnome apps cannot handle "ftp" locations.

Works fine here, so it's not a general issue:

[11:14 athena] ~> gvfs-mount ftp://ftp.kernel.org
Enter password for ftp on ftp.kernel.org
User: Anonymous
Password: 

Which versions of libsoup and libsoup-gnome do you have installed?

Hi, thanks for the quick response! Have installed:
net-libs/libsoup-2.26.3-r3  USE="gnome ssl -debug -doc"
net-libs/libsoup-gnome-2.26.3-r1  USE="-debug -doc"

An emerge --info and most likely a copy of your ~/.xsession-errors would be nice.

Are you starting X from startx?  If so, how are you setting up your session?

After this general update / upgrade FTP was back for Gnome apps including Nautilus. Problem solved,.. but what was the problem?!..

Nothing in there has a relation to the gnome stack. I bet it's a dbus reloading problem. Anyway, closing worksforme per your last comment.
