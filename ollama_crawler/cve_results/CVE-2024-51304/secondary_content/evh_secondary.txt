(NYSE: EVH), a company that specializes in better health outcomes for people with complex conditions through proven solutions that make health care simpler and more affordable, today announced financial results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023. Seth Blackley, Chief Executive Officer, and Co-Founder of Evolent stated, "We ended 2023 on a strong note, achieving all of our financial objectives for the year. Annual revenue increased over 45% while we continued to deliver strong earnings, driven by continued underlying growth as well as the successful integration of NIA. I am incredibly proud of our global team who worked so hard to collectively deliver what we promised to both shareholders and partners in 2023. Our financial position is strong as cash flow exceeded our target for the year and we significantly improved our cash and balance sheet flexibility.” Mr. Blackley continued, “We are off to a strong start for growth in 2024, with four new revenue agreements that illustrate the success of our strategy to become a leader for value-based specialty care for complex conditions. Our initial financial outlook for 2024 includes revenue growth of 25% at the midpoint, exceeds our multi-year revenue and profit growth targets and we believe is also consistent with achieving Evolent’s annual run-rate profit target exiting 2024. We continue to believe the current challenges facing the healthcare system represent future opportunities for Evolent, given our low penetration and proven value proposition in a rapidly growing market.”Highlights from the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023 announcement include (in thousands):For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2023For the Year Ended December 31, 2023Financial Results:Revenue$556,055 $1,963,896 Net loss attributable to common shareholders of Evolent Health, Inc.$(41,395)$(142,260)Net loss margin(7.4)%(7.2)%Adjusted EBITDA$48,055 $194,678 Adjusted EBITDA Margin8.6 %9.9 %Average Lives on Platform/CasesPerformance Suite5,986 4,236 Specialty Technology and Services Suite72,139 69,494 Administrative Services1,815 1,831 Cases15 61 Average Unique Members40,576 41,340 1The following information was filed by Evolent Health, Inc.

 Inside Evolent Health, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
A significant change to these estimates and assumptions could cause the estimated fair values of our reporting unit and intangible assets to decline and increase the risk of an impairment charge to earnings.



 Legal - Other   Highlight
Qualitative factors include macroeconomic, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, industry, legal and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
However, significant sustained inflation driven by the macroeconomic environment or other factors could negatively impact our margins, profitability and results of operations in future periods.

 Other - Other   Highlight
If actual settlements differ from these estimates, or we adjust these estimates in future periods, we may need to recognize additional tax benefits or charges that could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.

 Legal - Other   Highlight
The increase included approximately $344.1 million from higher claims cost from acquisitions and transition from ASO to risk based contracts for certain customers.
