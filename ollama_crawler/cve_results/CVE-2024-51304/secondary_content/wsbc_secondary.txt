Financial and operational highlights during the quarter ended December 31, 2023:
•Deposits of $13.2 billion increased both year-over-year and sequentially, reflecting deposit gathering and retention efforts across retail and business customers
oAverage loans to average deposits were 87%, providing capacity to fund loan growth

oLoan production offices continued to contribute meaningfully to the commercial loan pipeline
•Non-interest income increased 8.0% year-over-year, supported by new commercial loan swap and wealth management fees
oNew commercial swap fees totaled $9.0 million during 2023
oTrust assets increased to $5.4 billion, driven by both market value adjustments and organic growth
•Net interest margin of 3.02% was stable to the third quarter of 2023
•Key credit quality metrics such as non-performing assets, total past due loans, and net loan charge-offs, as percentages of total portfolio loans, have remained at low levels and favorable to peer bank averages (based upon the prior four quarters for banks with total assets between $10 billion and $25 billion)

•WesBanco continued to earn national accolades, being recognized as one of America’s Best Regional Banks by Newsweek
 
“Record interest rate escalation by the Federal Reserve had a significant impact on all banks, including WesBanco. Despite that headwind, WesBanco performed well during 2023 through our continued focus on customer service and sustainable growth strategies. We achieved sustained loan, deposit, and fee income growth, while maintaining strong capital levels and credit quality,” said Jeff Jackson, President and Chief Executive Officer, WesBanco. “Our focus on further diversifying our revenue streams with new fee-based services is driving positive non-interest income trends. As we begin 2024, we remain well-capitalized with solid liquidity and a strong balance sheet to fund loan growth, positioning us well to continue generating value for our stakeholders.”

 Inside Wesbanco Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
However, differences between management’s estimation of expected future losses and actual incurred losses in subsequent periods may necessitate future adjustments to the provision for credit losses.



 Other - Other   Highlight
Due to those significant management judgments and the factors included in the calculation, significant changes to the allowance for credit losses could occur in future periods.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Management has identified the allowance for credit losses, the evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment and business combinations to be the accounting estimates that require the most subjective or complex judgments, and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
Wesbanco made an accounting policy election to exclude accrued interest from the measurement of the allowance for credit losses, because the Company has a robust policy in place to reverse or write-off accrued interest when the loan is placed on non-accrual, and also made an accounting policy election to reverse accrued interest deemed uncollectible as a reversal of interest income.

 Other - Other   Highlight
The allowance for credit losses specific to loans reduces the loan portfolio to the net amount expected to be collected, representing the lifetime expected credit losses at the initial origination date.
