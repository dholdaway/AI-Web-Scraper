I have an external ISDN-modem which is connectet at the serial interface.
With Kernel 2.6.18-gentoo-r6 kppp works only with the option noccp.

Until kernel 2.6.17-gentoo-r8 compression works.

I've just tested <deflate 15> <deflate(old#) 15>  + VJ compression and it works as expected.

Test case: net-dialup/pptpd + net-dialup/ppp-2.4.3-r16 on server and net-dialup/pptpclient + net-dialup/ppp-2.4.4-r4 + baselayout PPP net module + kernel gentoo-sources-2.6.18-r6 on client.
