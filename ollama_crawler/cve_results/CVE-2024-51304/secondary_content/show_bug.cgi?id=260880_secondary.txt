Hello,

you're receiving this canned bug because the package in summary uses the flag -Werror during build, which transforms warnings in errors, and is prone to break software when new GCC releases are added to Gentoo.

Please make sure your package does not use -Werror during build, so that it can be more future-proof for the new GCC releases.

Thanks,
Diego

removes all werrors

I believe that this patch should be applied against the xen package and the xen-tools package. It applies cleanly against xen-tools-3.4.1, I haven't had time to check it against anything else.

I think that tools/ioemu-qemu-xen/configure will not enable -Werror by default. In fact, that configure file is an example of how xen should handle -Werror.

The reason to try to remove -Werror from packages is to prevent potentially avoidable Gentoo bugs from being filed. The following is an example of such a bug that would be filed: http://bugzilla.xensource.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1427 . While this bug is probably something that should be fixed in the xen source, most of these warnings can be safely ignored.
