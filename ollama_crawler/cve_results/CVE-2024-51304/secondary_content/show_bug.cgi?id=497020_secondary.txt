How so? We just changed it from "none" to "proc", the mount option says that using "none" here is not recommended, and most sources recommend "proc" so that later kernel messages pertaining to the /proc file system mention it as "proc".

Did you get an error by using proc? If so, with what installation medium?

(In reply to Sven Vermeulen from comment #1)

Sorry, it means that doc translated from english version (it, fr, etc) are behind at this moment, I thought was a transcription error.
So I didn't use "proc" and now I'm no longer under the conditions to retry the chroot with "proc", the english version is surely correct.

Greetings

I'm going to close this as WORKSFORME then. The translation teams should update their documents, but that is more "business as usual" unless they become too old (at which they get unlinked).
