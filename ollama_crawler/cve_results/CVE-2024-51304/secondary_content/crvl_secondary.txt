CorVel Announces Revenues and Earnings  
FORT WORTH, Texas, May 22, 2024 — CorVel Corporation (NASDAQ: CRVL) announced the results for the quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. Revenues for the quarter were $207 million, an increase from $185 million in the same quarter of the previous year. Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.12, compared to $1.04 in the same quarter of the prior year. 
 
Revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 were $795 million, compared to $719 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. Earnings per share for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, were $4.40, compared to $3.77 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023.
 
Patient Management services, including revenue from our Third Party Administration (TPA) customers, increased 11%, significantly contributing to our overall year-over-year fiscal revenue growth.  CorVel’s third-place ranking in Workers’ Compensation revenue on Business Insurance’s 2024 TPA Rankings and Directory highlights the company's ongoing success in providing effective solutions to the market. 
 
Recent Development Updates
 
Fiscal year 2024 experienced a solid increase in new bookings compared to prior years and a net revenue retention of 108%. Both are a testament to the commitment and engagement of the CorVel team and the growing reputation for meaningful results the Company has earned in the market. Feedback from partners is that the service, communication, transparency, and innovative technological solutions CorVel provides are unmatched in the industry.
 
CorVel invested in and implemented Generative AI (GAI) functionality during the fiscal year, which brought substantive benefits across the enterprise and a broad foundation from which additional GAI functionality will be deployed in the future. As a result of those efforts, the Company has introduced GAI-powered software as a service (SaaS) platform to the managed care market. The data and service hub will automate tasks and leverage AI to increase efficiencies within workflows. The model will also lessen IT constraints for CorVel’s partners and allow seamless integration between RMIS systems and other provider platforms.
