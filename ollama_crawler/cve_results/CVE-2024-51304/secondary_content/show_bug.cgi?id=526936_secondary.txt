The emerge of net-misc/openvswitch (multiple versions) fails with this message:
 * openvswitch-2.3.0.tar.gz SHA256 SHA512 WHIRLPOOL size ;-) ...                                                     [ ok ]
 * Determining the location of the kernel source code
 * Found kernel source directory:
 *     /usr/src/linux
 * Found kernel object directory:
 *     /lib/modules/3.16.5-gentoo/build
 * Found sources for kernel version:
 *     3.16.5-gentoo
 * ERROR: net-misc/openvswitch-2.3.0-r1::gentoo failed (setup phase):
 *   Linux >= 2.6.32 and <= 3.14 required for userspace modules

I tried net-misc/openvswitch-2.0.0-r3 and net-misc/openvswitch-2.3.0-r1,
both with the same result.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install and boot kernel sys-kernel/gentoo-sources-3.16.5
2.Try to emerge net-misc/openvswitch (in order to install the ovs kernel module)
3.
Actual Results:  
My new 3.16 kernel has no network because it lacks the openvswitch module.
See the error messages from the emerge below:

 * openvswitch-2.3.0.tar.gz SHA256 SHA512 WHIRLPOOL size ;-) ...                                                     [ ok ]
 * Determining the location of the kernel source code
 * Found kernel source directory:
 *     /usr/src/linux
 * Found kernel object directory:
 *     /lib/modules/3.16.5-gentoo/build
 * Found sources for kernel version:
 *     3.16.5-gentoo
 * ERROR: net-misc/openvswitch-2.3.0-r1::gentoo failed (setup phase):
 *   Linux >= 2.6.32 and <= 3.14 required for userspace modules

Expected Results:  
Openvswitch should be rebuilt and reinstalled successfully.


The openvswitch ebuilds should be modified to accept higher kernel versions.

Okay, forget it.
I just discovered that recent kernel sources now include the openvswitch kernel module, so I don't need the kernel module from the net-misc/openvswitch package.

If this is correct, than you can close this ticket.
But may I suggest to please make the ebuild print an advice on this?
Thank you for the good work!

It does say it's a problem for useerspace :P

    kernel_is ge 2 6 32 || die "Linux >= 2.6.32 and <= 3.14 required for userspace modules"
    kernel_is le 3 14 || die "Linux >= 2.6.32 and <= 3.14 required for userspace modules"
