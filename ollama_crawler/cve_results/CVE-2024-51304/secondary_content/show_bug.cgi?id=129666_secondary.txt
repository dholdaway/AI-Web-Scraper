Summary: {D}usr should be {D}/usr

Details:

function tetex-3_src_install() begins with

        tetex_src_install

        dodir /etc/env.d
        echo 'CONFIG_PROTECT_MASK="/etc/texmf/web2c"' > ${D}/etc/env.d/98tetex
        # populate /etc/texmf
        keepdir /etc/texmf/web2c
        cd ${D}/usr/share/texmf         # not ${TEXMF_PATH}
        for d in $(find . -name config -type d | sed -e "s:\./::g") ; do
                dodir /etc/texmf/${d}
                for f in $(find ${D}usr/share/texmf/$d -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1); do

This last line 
  for f in $(find ${D}usr/share/texmf/$d -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1); do
should read
  for f in $(find ${D}/usr/share/texmf/$d -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1); do
