The ebuild currently has LICENSE="as-is" which most likely is wrong.

This is a binary package, and there is no license included in the tarball. Also I cannot find any info about distribution terms on the HOMEPAGE.

Can you please ask upstream for clarification under with terms this package can be distributed?

heh.  this has a very tricky history.  the company involved (rebel) no longer exists.  afaik, the source hasn't been released, although some people have it.  the binaries in question are shipped on devices and can be extracted via that.

I fear that we'll end up with adding an "all-rights-reserved" license for cases like this. But let's postpone it until I've scanned all as-is packages, because I first want to get the big picture.

Do we need RESTRICT="bindist mirror"?

i don't think so.  it's been almost 10 years and no gives a sh*t about this.  we're talking about a long dead platform.

OK to change LICENSE to "all-rights-reserved" for this package?

The problem is that all-rights-reserved implies mirror restriction. So we need a valid SRC_URI, but I cannot find one.

i've mirrored it here:
http://wh0rd.org/gentoo/nettrom-2.3.3.tar.gz

I've changed LICENSE to "all-rights-reserved" and added mirror and bindist restriction. SRC_URI refers to wh0rd.org now.

@Licenses team: Is mirror restriction enough, or do we need fetch restriction (because wh0rd.org isn't the copyright holder)? Please reopen if you think so.
