When I attempt to build Test-Inline-2.103 on alpha or ia64 (and probably any other platform) it loops infinitely:

(1) Africa
(2) Asia
(3) Central America
(4) Europe
(5) North America
(6) Oceania
(7) South America
Select your continent (or several nearby continents) [] 
Sorry! since you don't have any existing picks, you must make a
geographic selection.

sorry for the screwed up emerge --info, I don't know why it wrapped oddly like that.

looks like one of the deps is missing, so its invoking autoinstall (a pain we try to fix by getting the deps right to begin with ;)

did you capture this in a portage log? would need to see which dep it failed way back at the beginning, before invoking the cpan config for you. also, have you upgraded perl recently? Going ahead and checking since most times the confusion is between what perl can see and what portage thinks is installed (hence perl-cleaner, in all its gory detail)

Running perl-cleaner didn't change anything.  From the emerge output, it appears the problem is Pod::Tests missing, but from what I can see:

$ epm -q Pod-Tests 
Pod-Tests-0.18

$ epm -ql Pod-Tests | grep perl5
/usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.7/alpha-linux/auto/Pod-Tests/.packlist
/usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.7/Pod/Tests.pm

$ epm -q perl
perl-5.8.7-r3

So I don't see what exactly is wrong with the existing installation.  Nonetheless, I remerged Pod-Tests and now Test-Inline merges correctly!  Feel free to close this bug, but I would be interested in understanding better what happened.

I honestly can't 'splain this one...perl-cleaner should have grabbed pods-test during an upgrade path, and it was in the right place to be caught by your perl.
