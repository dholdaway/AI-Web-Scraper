Currently the only drivers known to work (for me anyway) w/ the ATI Radeon Xpress 200M card are the 8.24.8 version, which for some reason has been removed from the portage tree. It would be nice if it was added back, or if some one would verify the newer drivers that are in the tree do work on this specific card.

8.28.8 and 8.29.6 (not in portage yet) should work with this card. If not, well then go complain to ATI.

8.28.8 at least definatly does not work with this card in the gentoo build... (I suppose it might work on RedHat (which ati supports) but I'm not inclined to test that...)

Be sure I will complain to ati about it, however I suspect I won't get past "what version of Redhat are you using" when I do...

In the mean time, it would be nice it the ebuild of the version which *is* known to work for this card could be left in portage....

please?
