Description


Diego Elio Pettenò (RETIRED)






          2008-11-18 20:07:29 UTC
        

I'm reporting this bug because the package in summary fails to build when forcing --as-needed on through spec files (check out http://blog.flameeyes.eu/2008/11/14/problems-and-mitigation-strategies-for-as-needed for details).

Check the attached build log.

Thanks,
Diego
