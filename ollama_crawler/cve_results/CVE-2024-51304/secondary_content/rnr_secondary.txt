 Inside Renaissancere Holdings Ltd's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
From time to time, rating agencies may make changes in their capital models and rating methodologies, which could increase the amount of capital required to support our ratings.



 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
In addition, due to the magnitude and complexity of certain large loss events, meaningful uncertainty remains regarding losses from these events and our actual ultimate net losses from these events may vary materially from preliminary estimates, which would impact our cash flows from operations.

 Legal - Other   Highlight
In addition, it is possible we could be adversely affected by other future changes in tax laws, regulation, or enforcement, any of which could increase our effective tax rate more rapidly or steeply than we currently anticipate.

 Financial - Shares   Highlight
It is possible we will increase our equity allocation in the future, and it could, from time to time, have a material effect on our financial results.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
General economic inflation has increased over the past few years compared to recent historical norms, and there is a risk of inflation remaining elevated for an extended period, which could cause claims and claims related expenses to increase, impact the performance of our investment portfolio, or have other adverse effects.
