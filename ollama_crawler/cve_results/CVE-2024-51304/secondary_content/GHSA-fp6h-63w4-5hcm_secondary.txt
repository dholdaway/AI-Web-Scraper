Description



Impact
A security vulnerability has been identified in mailcow affecting versions < 2024-04. This vulnerability resides in the exception handling mechanism, specifically when not operating in DEV_MODE. The system saves exception details into a session array without proper sanitization or encoding. These details are later rendered into HTML and executed in a JavaScript block within the user's browser, without adequate escaping of HTML entities. This flaw allows for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, where attackers can inject malicious scripts into the admin panel by triggering exceptions with controlled input. The exploitation method involves using any function that might throw an exception with user-controllable argument. This issue can lead to session hijacking and unauthorized administrative actions, posing a significant security risk.

        CVSS v3 base metrics
      









 

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.


Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.


Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.


User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.


Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.


Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.


Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.


Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
