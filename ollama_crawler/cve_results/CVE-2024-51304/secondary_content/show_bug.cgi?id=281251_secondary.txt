I'm trying to use the latest ebuild: app-editors/emacs-cvs-23.1.9999-r1 to upgrade from 23.0.96. The ebuild fails with the log I will attach.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. unmask app-editors/emacs-cvs
2. emerge emacs-cvs

Actual Results:  
See attached log (fails to log into cvs.savannah.gnu.org)

Expected Results:  
Successful anonymous CVS login and attempt to build the package.

Works fine here. Looks like a local nameserver problem to me.

Can you try from a different machine?

No answer. Closing.
