3.3.1 needs patching or patches should be included with 3.3.2 release

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
sa-update
defined(%hash) is deprecated at /usr/lib64/perl5/vendor_perl/5.12.0/Mail/SpamAssassin/Dns.pm line 757.
	(Maybe you should just omit the defined()?)


Expected Results:  
no output

I am going to close this as it seems to be fixed with 5.12.1
quad ~ # sa-update
quad ~ # perl -v

This is perl 5, version 12, subversion 1 (v5.12.1) built for x86_64-linux
(with 5 registered patches, see perl -V for more detail)
