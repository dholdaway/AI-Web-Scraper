When I try to start this version of acroread, it immediately coredumps on start-
up, so is completely unuseable.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type "acroread" <CR>.
Actual Results:  
It coredumped.

Expected Results:  
The program should have started.

Please change the mask on app-text/acroread-7.0.1.1 to masked or at least 
testing. It is certainly NOT stable. Please, only then mark this bug as closed, 
as it can only be fixed upstream.

Note that this is probably the same bug as listed in 97801, "https://bugs.
gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97801". In fact that package should also be marked as 
"testing" as it is also certainly not stable.

The only acroread that I find is stable is v5.10, which is, ironically, hard 
masked....

I have been successfully using 7.0.0.2-r2 since it was marked stable about a
month ago. However, after upgrading recently to 7.0.1.1 I hit this bug.
Furthermore, even when I unmerge 7.0.1.1 and then emerge 7.0.0.2-r2 I now
encounter the coredump with 7.0.0.2-r2.

search in the forums for this looks like many people got this problem and this
seems to be solved when you remove your ~/.adobe dir
see this
http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-349418-highlight-acroread.html

reopen if you still have problems.

For all acroread-7.* release I had to change

export GCONV_PATH="/usr/lib/gconv"
to
export GCONV_PATH="/emul/linux/x86/usr/lib/gconv"

in the beginning of the acroread script. I wonder how it could work for someone
(under amd64) otherwise.

Modifying the GCONV_PATH in the acroread script made it work for me. Thanks.
