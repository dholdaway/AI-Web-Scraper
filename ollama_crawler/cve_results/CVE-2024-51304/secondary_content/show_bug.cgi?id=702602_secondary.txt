Description

After glibc finishes the installation, the following information is given:

 * Installation of a symlink is blocked by a directory:                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 *   '/lib'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 * This symlink will be merged with a different name:                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 *   '/lib.backup.0001'

I've already merged the new profile into my custom profile before:
https://www.gentoo.org/support/news-items/2019-06-05-amd64-17-1-profiles-are-now-stable.html

With the new multilib layout is expected that /lib is a directory and not a symlink.

It sounds like something is wrong with your custom profile. It probably does not set the correct value for SYMLINK_LIB.

If you still can't recover your system please post your emerge --info.
