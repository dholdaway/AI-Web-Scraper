Package fails to build because the specified source file is not in portage, and does not appear to exist on the internet.

2016-01-08 10:54:39 (1.31 MB/s) - ‘/usr/portage/distfiles/xnec2c-3.4.tar.bz2’ saved [922924/922924]

!!! Fetched file: xnec2c-3.4.tar.bz2 VERIFY FAILED!
!!! Reason: Filesize does not match recorded size
!!! Got:      922924
!!! Expected: 922548

I was able to find the right source file by going to gentoo.org and going to mirrors and saving the file manually, until I found one that matched the checksum.

I have this problem a lot and it is annoying.  It seems like there would be a way to check mirrors for the incorrect versions of source files and remove them, so that a gentoo install would just pick another mirror with the correct file.  Or something like that.

Sorry to complain, I love using gentoo and it usually works just great.
