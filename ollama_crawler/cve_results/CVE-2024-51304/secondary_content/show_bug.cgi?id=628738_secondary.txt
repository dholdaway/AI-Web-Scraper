Description

An unstated dependency between chromium and openjpeg:0 is created if that library is present while chromium is built. This is revealed when chromium is built as a binary package and distributed to a Gentoo system without openjpeg installed. 

On the bright side, I haven't experienced any issues with Chromium built against system-openjpeg. :-) 

Unfortunately I'm not familiar with the Chromium build system to a sufficient degree to suggest a fix...

I can't reproduce this.

Could you make the bug report more precise by providing the following?

- emerge --info
- version number of chromium and USE flags
- steps to reproduce the problem
- how specifically does the problem manifest (verbatim error messages)
