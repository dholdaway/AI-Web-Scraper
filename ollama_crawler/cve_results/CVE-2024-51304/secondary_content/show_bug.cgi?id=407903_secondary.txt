app-editors/nano-2.3.1-r1 build failure

This only occurs during the bootstrap process. I believe that it occurs on multiple platforms, but I can most readily reproduce it on a 64-core PPC64 Fedora system. I had initially suspected that it is related to bug #407599, but sys-apps/file is already installed by the time nano is installed.

I tried examining it by copying sys-libs/glibc's /usr/include directory from a Gentoo system to ~/include, but it then proceeded to install without a problem. I was fiddling with the LDFLAGS, but at the point at which it worked, I was trying produce a simple failure prior to instructing it to use the Gentoo headers.

I do not have time to debug this any further right now, but I am filing a bug report to recommend dekeywording app-editors/nano-2.3.1 and app-editors/nano-2.3.1-r1 until this issue is resolved. It will cause headaches for people if a new tree snapshot is taken with these two keyworded.

1) WFM on x64-macos.
2) No steps to reproduce.

I'll try latest_tree again before we release a new snapshot.

I just did this today, and it WFM.

I didn't have much time to spend on this, but I tried again today and I can no longer reproduce this issue either.
