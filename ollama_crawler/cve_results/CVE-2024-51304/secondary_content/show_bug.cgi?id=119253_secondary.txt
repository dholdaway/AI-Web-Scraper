Description

After installing this new Qt and rebooting, I noticed konsole wouldn't start by entering in just konsole.  I found it was still in /usr/kde/bin, but that was not in the PATH.

After further investigation, I see a 44qt4 and 45qt3 in /etc/env.d/.

Now to my knowledge, and equery's output backed me up, there is supposed to be a 45kdepaths-3.5 in there.  I think somebody put that env file in the wrong spot.  

Also, it appears Qt isn't slotted anymore as well, so I'm a little confused as to why there is a 45qt3 when qt3 was unmerged from my system.

Why would you think Qt isn't slotted?

My system has: 44qt4, 45qt3, 45kdepaths-3.5, 46kdepaths-3.4

I think you've got some other issue.

why would I think qt isn't slotted?

Only because it unmerged qt3.  I used to have qt3 and qt4 on there, but clean apparently got qt3 this time.

As for the paths overwritten, i have no idea, i just remerged kdelib and the paths are fine again.

Take this report as you may, and close it if you don't feel its important.

Upgrading to Qt4 won't unmerge Qt3.  If that happened then something else caused it.

I suppose a good question is: how did you do the emerge for Qt4?  Perhaps you're using an option that is causing something funky to happen.

All I can assume then is that you're doing something unconventional.  Qt is still properly slotted and it has no affect on KDE and the paths.
