Description

          2005-07-07 08:33:09 UTC
        

I have a Logitech MX700 cordless mouse. 
The receiver for this mouse also serves as the receiver for a matching 
Logitech keyboard. 
I can properly setup a Udev rule to name this USB device. The problem is that 
since this device services both a mouse and keyboard, it generates 
two /dev/input/eventX nodes. 
 
It appears the the event node for the keyboard comes before the event node for 
the mouse, (key=/dev/input/event2, mouse=/dev/input/event3), but depend in 
what other devices are attached, there is no guarantee that 2 will be the 
first event node for this device. 
 
With the coming Xorg 6.8.99 series having proper evdev support this will 
become increasingly important. 
 
Any ideas or suggestions. 
 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
2.
3.



Expected Results:  
Want to be able to properly select the /dev/ node for each event device on a 
dual receiver USB device. 

emerge info not needed, functionality of Udev is correct.

BUS="usb", KERNEL="event[0-9]*", SYSFS{manufacturer}="Logitech", 
SYSFS{product}="USB Receiver", SYMLINK="input/logitech%s{bInterfaceNumber}" 
 
That's probably what you need. 
I have an LX700 cordless set and I use that to have /dev/input/logitech00 
and /dev/input/logitech01

That worked. 
 
I returned back to 6.8.2 because all the buttons weren't properly recognized. 
 
For some odd reason when returning to 6.8.2, if the udev rule you suggested was 
still applied, Xorg would not start. I remove the /dev/nodes and restart udev 
and it works. (using "Device" "/dev/input/mice"
