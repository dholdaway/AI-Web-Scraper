 Inside Confluent, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
We cannot be certain how long these uncertain macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical events, and their resulting effects on our industry, our financial results, our business strategy, and customers will persist.



 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, sales commissions, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation, amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs, which primarily consist of sales commissions and the associated payroll taxes, conferences, costs related to marketing programs, travel-related costs, and allocated overhead.

 Other - Other   Highlight
However, with this change, we experienced more volatility in ARR as our customers’ consumption trends have varied significantly across periods, which we expect to continue.

 Other - Other   Highlight
As of December 31, 2023, our purchase obligations were $743.6 million, of which $162.8 million is expected to be paid within 12 months and the remainder thereafter.
