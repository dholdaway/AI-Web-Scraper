THOMASVILLE, Ga. – Flowers Foods, Inc. (NYSE: FLO) today reported financial results for the company’s 52-week fiscal 2023 and 12-week fourth quarter ended December 30, 2023. 
Fiscal 2023 Summary:
Compared to the prior year where applicable
•Sales increased 5.9% to a record $5.091 billion.
•Net income decreased 46.0% to $123.4 million, primarily due to increased legal settlement expense. Adjusted net income(1) decreased 5.4% to $256.3 million.
•Adjusted EBITDA(1) decreased 0.1% to $501.7 million, representing 9.9% of sales, a 50-basis point decrease.
•Diluted EPS decreased $0.49 to $0.58. Adjusted diluted EPS(1) decreased $0.07 to $1.20.  
Fourth Quarter Summary:
Compared to the prior year fourth quarter where applicable
•Sales increased 4.3% to a fourth-quarter record, $1.129 billion.
•Net income decreased 26.6% to $35.7 million, primarily due to increased SD&A and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted net income(1) decreased 11.2% to $42.7 million.
•Adjusted EBITDA(1) increased 0.1% to $96.3 million, representing 8.5% of sales, a 40-basis point decrease.
•Diluted EPS decreased $0.06 to $0.17. Adjusted diluted EPS(1) decreased $0.03 to $0.20.  
Chairman and CEO Remarks:
“Flowers’ fourth quarter and full year 2023 results underscore the strength of our leading brands, as we delivered record sales despite difficult market conditions,” said Ryals McMullian, chairman and CEO of Flowers Foods. “Volume trends improved throughout the year, and we gained dollar and unit share in the fourth quarter for the first time since early 2022, reflecting the hard work of our team and investments in innovation and marketing. Dave's Killer Bread was a particular standout, achieving a record $1 billion in 2023 retail sales. Accelerated by our portfolio strategy, we also improved margins significantly in our cake, foodservice, and private label businesses. 
“The 2024 outlook reflects confidence in our ability to successfully execute in a challenging category. Results are expected to benefit from moderating commodity costs, positive pricing actions, and savings initiatives. Our strong execution on promotions is driving improved returns, but the competitive environment remains rational, with promotional activity significantly below pre-pandemic levels. We remain committed to investing in innovation and marketing, as well as converting our distribution model in California. While these initiatives may present near-term headwinds, they are expected to ultimately enhance shareholder value. Above all, we are focused on enabling future growth in line with our long-term financial targets.” 
For the 52-week Fiscal 2024, the Company Expects:
•Sales in the range of approximately $5.091 billion to $5.172 billion, representing 0.0% to 1.6% growth compared to the prior year. 
•Adjusted EBITDA(2) in the range of approximately $524 million to $553 million.
•Adjusted diluted EPS(2) in the range of approximately $1.20 to $1.30.
The company’s outlook is based on the following assumptions:
•Depreciation and amortization in the range of $160 million to $165 million.
•Net interest expense of approximately $22 million to $26 million.
•An effective tax rate of approximately 25%.
•Weighted average diluted share count for the year of approximately 213 million shares.
•Capital expenditures in the range of $120 million to $130 million, with $3 million to $6 million related to the ERP upgrade.

 Inside Flowers Foods Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Income   Highlight
While the company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance, which could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made.



 Other - Other   Highlight
Those potential risks include the possibility of future economic downturns that could result in a significant shift away from our branded retail products to store branded products, supply chain disruptions that have impacted, and could continue to impact, the procurement of raw materials and packaging items, and the workforce available to us, among other risks.

 Other - Other   Highlight
If actual market conditions become significantly different than those anticipated, raw material prices could increase significantly, adversely affecting our results of operations.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
However, we experienced significant input cost inflation for commodities and, to a lesser extent, for transportation and labor, in Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of these underlying assets could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the asset that may not be reflected in the asset’s current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future.
