Could arch teams please consider this version of vanilla-sources for stable keywords. Significant cleanup of ebuilds can be done once this task is completed.

Nope, 2.6 not so good for sparc yet, and even so 2.6.17 is better (niagara).

Security flaws have forced upgrades, and a cleanup has been performed. This bug report is no longer relevant.
