We need to verify that OpenRC works with the new network device names
described in the tracker this bug blocks.

On my system, which is a pretty simple test case with oldnet, it does.

I found my new network device name, created a net.* script for it in the
usual way, added it to the default runlevel, changed my /etc/conf.d/net
accordingly, and rebooted successfully.

I know OpenRc is being used with the new network names, so things are
working. I haven't seen any bug reports stating otherwise.
