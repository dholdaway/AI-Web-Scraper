Hi,

Its really positive to have a tool that can do backups of the changes it makes
during the etc files update. It's also a lot more comfortable to use. 

How about md5summing the config files at installation time and automatically
update them unless they no longer match the md5sum at upgrade time? This would
greatly ease the maintenance of these files and is less prone to human error.
