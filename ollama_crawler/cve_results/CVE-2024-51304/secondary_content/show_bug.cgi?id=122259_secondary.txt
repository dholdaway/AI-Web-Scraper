Since Konqueror crashes so much, I have enabled the "crashes monitor" extension.  Now, when I go to the menu (Tools > Crashes), the submenu takes several seconds to appear and is larger than the screen (Konqueror has crashed that much).  Of course, this is useless to me, since I cannot get to the latest crash.  And for all of my googling and asking on forums, I cannot find a way to clear the menu to start fresh.  Perhaps there's such an option on that menu; it's just off the screen.

I would report this upstream, but bugs.kde.org won't let me report bugs for 3.4.3, which is the latest in Gentoo stable.

Time to push 3.5 into stable?

I doubt my emerge --info would be helpful for this one.

Sorry about the duplicate.  I accidentally resubmitted the form.  I was just about to mark the duplicate as a duplicate when Konqueror crashed.

Do you still get the problem with a fresh kde session. Either create a temp user and login, or move .kde aside temporarily to see if it fixes it?

I logged in as root and started up KDE.  As root, I get a crashes monitor menu that is small enough that I can see that the very LAST option is the one to clear the menu.

So, the crashes monitor does record crashes, but the bug is that the option to clear the menu is off the screen, so I cannot get to it.

Haven't had such a problem and you can always move windows using <Alt> + mouse. Stale bug for a while now, resolving.
