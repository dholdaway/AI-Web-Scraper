genkernel should set CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT by default
everything is enabled but CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT is not...
also tested on 3.4.52.4-r2 (same thing)

the way to solve the problem:


echo "CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT=m" >> /usr/share/genkernel/arch/x86_64/generated-config
for x86 also
echo "CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT=m" >> /usr/share/genkernel/arch/x86/generated-config

This is already changed in the 3.5 series, and was disabled for good reason in the older kernels; not changing in the 3.4 series now.
