Even the LINGUAS=de is set everything in mozilla-thunderbird is in English except the enigmail menu is in German es expected. But signs like ä,ö,ü and ß appear odd.
Additionally it's not possible to import the old gpg-keys after the update.
After importing the old key via in the "key-manager", I get the message that the key was successfully imported, but it does not appear in the list and I'm not able to decrypt mails.

Reproducible: Always

After a rebuild enigmail is now working. But the language issue persists.

can you verify in your tb advanced config options you have "intl.locale.matchOS;true"

Yes. In my config intl.locale.matchOS is on default true.

I'm not sure if it is correlating, but I'm running firefox 3.6 and there everything is in German as expected.

Is this still an issue in 3.0.5?

I don't know if this problem is resolved in 3.0.5. or not. But I found the reason for the language problem:
There was a conflict with an old language pack of a previous version of thunderbird. After uninstalling the old language pack manually everything works fine.
Perhaps old language packs should be deleted automatically on updates.
