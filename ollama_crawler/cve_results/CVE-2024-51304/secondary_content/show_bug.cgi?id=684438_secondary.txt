Hi,

I just looked at this ebuild, and you are improperly mirroring the
upstream source.

The only thing that should go in your dev space is a tarball containing the
vendor directory.

Thanks,

William

Hello William, I appreciate that you have reviewed the ebuild. However I decided to mirror the upstream source since we are talking about just 32kB which makes the ebuild a bit simply

If the upstream source will grow, I'll mirror just the vendor, for now I guess it is fine as is.
