PTC Announces Fourth fiscal Quarter and Full Year 2023 Results
Solid ARR and Cash Flow in Fourth Fiscal Quarter and Full Year
BOSTON, MA, November 1, 2023 - PTC (NASDAQ: PTC) today reported financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and full year ended September 30, 2023. 
“In our fourth fiscal quarter, we again delivered solid ARR and cash flow results. We reported ARR growth of 26%, organic ARR growth of 15%, and organic constant currency ARR growth of 13%. Our ServiceMax® business contributed an additional 11 points of ARR growth, taking constant currency ARR growth to 23%. Our operating cash flow was $50 million in Q4, up 29% year over year, and $611 million in FY’23, up 40%. Our free cash flow was $44 million in Q4, up 52% year over year, and $587 million in FY’23, up 41%,” said James Heppelmann, CEO, PTC.
“Our differentiated product portfolio and our industry-leading SaaS capabilities align well to the manufacturing industry’s push for digital transformation. On a constant currency basis, Creo and Windchill ARR continued to grow at a double-digit pace, growing 10% and 16% respectively; ServiceMax ended fiscal 2023 at the $170 million of ARR we guided to previously; and our Codebeamer ARR has more than doubled since we acquired the business six quarters ago. Our strong market position and solid execution, coupled with our subscription model, position PTC to continue delivering durable and consistent ARR and cash flow growth,” concluded Heppelmann.
 
Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Highlights
Key operating and financial highlights are set forth below. The definitions of our operating and non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures are included below and in the reconciliation tables at the end of this press release.

 Inside Ptc Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Debt   Highlight
Our expected uses and sources of cash could change, our cash position could be reduced, and we could incur additional debt obligations if we decide to retire other debt, engage in strategic transactions, or repurchase shares, any of which could be commenced, suspended, or completed at any time.



 Other - Other   Highlight
A critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time of the estimate, and different estimates that we could have used, or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur, may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
Other income (expense), net in FY22 included $36 million of recognized gains from the sale of assets, primarily related to the sale of a portion of our PLM services business, offset by a $35 million loss associated with an equity investment in a publicly traded company.

 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
Non-GAAP Financial Measures The non-GAAP financial measures presented in the discussion of our results of operations and the respective most directly comparable GAAP measures are: free cash flowcash flow from operations non-GAAP gross marginGAAP gross margin non-GAAP operating incomeGAAP operating income non-GAAP operating marginGAAP operating margin non-GAAP net incomeGAAP net income non-GAAP diluted earnings per shareGAAP diluted earnings per share Free cash flow is cash flow from operations net of capital expenditures, which are expenditures for property and equipment and consist primarily of facility improvements, office equipment, computer equipment, and software.
