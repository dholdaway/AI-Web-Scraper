I get exactly the same with a bit extra:

 * 
 * ERROR: media-gfx/skencil-0.6.18_pre20080519 failed.
 * Call stack:
 *               ebuild.sh, line   49:  Called src_compile
 *             environment, line 2356:  Called die
 * The specific snippet of code:
 *       ./setup.py configure `use_with nls` || die;
 *  The die message:
 *   (no error message)

no difference and same output running: 
$sudo emerge USE=nls media-gfx/skencil 

this prevents media-gfx/inkscape-0.46-r2 compiling

Since dev-python/imaging is in DEPEND for skencil, my best guess is that you upgraded python and didn't run python-updater after. Please either run python-updater or simply remerge imaging and see if skencil will build after that. Re-open if necessary.

Created attachment 163909 [details]
build.log

I run python-updater now again.

 host ~ # python-updater 
 host ~ # 

After this i tried emerge skencil.
Same error again.

May it be that you removed Python 2.4 before running python-updater? python-updater provides you with the options to deal with this...

Could you please do the following, in that order:

10 Check whether /usr/include/python2.5/Imaging.h exists.
20 If not re-emerge =dev-lang/python-2.5.
30 GOTO 10

I tried reemerge python, but this doesn't help

# stat /usr/include/python2.5/Imaging.h
stat: cannot stat `/usr/include/python2.5/Imaging.h': No such file or directory

# emerge python
...
>>> dev-lang/python-2.5.2-r6 merged.
...

# stat /usr/include/python2.5/Imaging.h

# emerge skencil

Did you unmerge python-2.4 yet? It could be that the ebuild or the upstream build system confuses the 2.4 includes with what 2.5 offers...

It sounds like python-updater didn't remerge dev-python/imaging for python-2.5. You could use 'qlop -l' to tell for sure if it has been emerged again after python2.5.

Anyways, python2.5/Imaging.h header file should get created if you emerge dev-python/imaging manually -- at worst you might have to unmerge dev-python/imaging before installing it fresh (let us know if you do have to unmerge first to make it work right, that would be a bug).

I don't have python-2.4 (it was unmerget on 21 Aug 2008 10:52:56)

 $ epm -qGa |grep '/.*python'
 app-admin/python-updater-0.5
 dev-lang/python-2.5.2-r6
 dev-python/dbus-python-0.82.4
 dev-python/wxpython-2.6.4.0-r1
 dev-python/python-fchksum-1.7.1

last emerge of imaging was:

 $ qlop -l | grep imaging | tail -n 1
 Mon Sep 25 13:26:39 2006 >>> dev-python/imaging-1.1.5

after reemerge dev-python/imaging file /usr/include/python2.5/Imaging.h exists.
then skencil emerged successfully.
