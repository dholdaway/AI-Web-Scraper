I installed =games-server/tetrix-1.13.16.1.40c-r2
I connected to the server with gtetrintet and clicked the start game button. The game did not start.
I did the same on a debian and it worked.
I copied the config from the debian to my gentoo and it still not worked.

Reproducible: Always

Works fine for me when using tetrix on the localhost.  Reopen with the output from emerging games-server/tetrix and the text from the screen in gtetrinet
