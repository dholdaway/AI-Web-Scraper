News Release              Media Contact: Jennifer Garber24-Hour: 800.559.3853Analyst Contact: Abby MotsingerOffice: 704.382.7624February 8, 2024Duke Energy reports fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 financial results▪2023 reported EPS of $3.54 and adjusted EPS of $5.56, closing the year within guidance range▪Constructive rate case outcomes and portfolio simplification in 2023 provide clarity and momentum▪Five-year capital plan increasing to $73 billion to support unprecedented growth in the communities we serveCHARLOTTE, N.C. – Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) today announced 2023 full-year reported EPS of $3.54, prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), and adjusted EPS of $5.56. This is compared to reported and adjusted EPS of $3.17 and $5.27, respectively, for the full-year 2022.Adjusted EPS excludes the impact of certain items that are included in reported EPS. In 2023, these included charges related to organizational optimization and regulatory matters along with results from discontinued operations.Higher full-year 2023 adjusted results were primarily driven by contributions from rate cases, growth from riders and other retail margin and lower O&M expense along with a lower effective tax rate. These items were partially offset by higher interest expense and depreciation on a growing asset base along with unfavorable weather and electric volumes.The company is introducing 2024 adjusted EPS guidance of $5.85 to $6.10, and reaffirming its long-term adjusted EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2028 off the 2024 midpoint of $5.98. Management does not forecast reported GAAP EPS and related long-term growth rates. “Today we announced strong fourth-quarter results, concluding a year of resilience and agility as we overcame external challenges. We advanced strategic initiatives and delivered constructive regulatory outcomes that benefit our customers and company, while maintaining our commitment to safety, reliability and affordability,” said Lynn Good, Duke Energy chair, president and chief executive officer.“We enter 2024 with a clear vision, significant momentum and an increased $73 billion, five-year capital plan that will support our energy transition and the unprecedented growth of our jurisdictions. The strength of our regulated utilities and our increasing capital profile give us confidence in our ability to deliver sustainable value and earnings growth of 5% to 7% through 2028.”The following information was filed by Duke Energy Corp (DUK) on Thursday, February 8, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.
