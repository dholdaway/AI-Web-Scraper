Exhibit 99.1UWM Holdings Corporation AnnouncesFourth Quarter & Full Year 2023 ResultsFourth Quarter Loan Origination Volume of $24.4 Billion, Including Purchase Volume of $20.7 Billion. PONTIAC, MI, February 28, 2024 - UWM Holdings Corporation (NYSE: UWMC) (the "Company"), the publicly traded indirect parent of United Wholesale Mortgage (“UWM”), today announced its results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Total loan origination volume for the fourth quarter 2023 was $24.4 billion, of which $20.7 billion was purchase volume. Total loan originations for full year 2023 were $108.3 billion, of which $93.9 billion was purchase volume. The Company reported 4Q23 net loss of $461.0 million, inclusive of a $634.4 million decline in fair value of MSRs, and diluted loss per share of $0.29. The Company reported full year 2023 loss of $69.8 million, inclusive of a $854.1 million decline in fair value of MSRs, and diluted loss per share of $0.14.Mat Ishbia, Chairman and CEO of UWMC, said, "2023 was one of the best years in our company history. We were the number one mortgage originator in America, number one in purchase origination again, and, nine years running, the number one wholesale lender. We continue to be operationally profitable, the true measure of a mortgage originator's health, while our financial loss was driven by the MSR markdown which is a result of interest rate movements. Our recipe for success has not and will not change and we are currently doubling down on investing in our people, our products and our technology so that we can continue to provide the broker channel with the tools needed to win. I believe that 2024 is a tremendous opportunity for both UWM and the broker channel."Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights•Originations of $24.4 billion in 4Q23, compared to $29.7 billion in 3Q23 and $25.1 billion in 4Q22•Purchase originations of $20.7 billion in 4Q23, compared to $25.9 billion in 3Q23 and $21.7 billion in 4Q22•Total gain margin of 92 bps in 4Q23 compared to 97 bps in 3Q23 and 51 bps in 4Q22•Net loss of $461.0 million in 4Q23 compared to net income of $301.0 million in 3Q23 and net loss of $62.5 million 4Q22•Adjusted EBITDA of $99.6 million in 4Q23 compared to $112.1 million in 3Q23 and $60.4 million in 4Q22•Total equity of $2.5 billion at December 31, 2023, compared to $3.1 billion at September 30, 2023, and $3.2 billion at December 31, 2022•Unpaid principal balance of MSRs of $299.5 billion with a WAC of 4.43% at December 31, 2023, compared to $281.4 billion with a WAC of 4.20% at September 30, 2023, and $312.5 billion with a WAC of 3.64% at December 31, 2022•Ended 4Q23 with approximately $2.2 billion of available liquidity, including $497.5 million of cash, and $1.75 billion of available borrowing capacity, which includes $1.25 billion under lines of credit secured by agency and Ginnie Mae MSRs, and $500 million under an unsecured line of creditFull Year 2023 Highlights•    Originations of $108.3 billion in 2023, compared to $127.3 billion in 2022•    Record purchase originations of $93.9 billion in 2023, compared to $90.8 billion in 2022•    Net loss of $69.8 million in 2023, as compared to $931.9 million of net income in 2022•    Total gain margin of 92 bps in 2023 compared to 77 bps in 20221The following information was filed by Uwm Holdings Corp (UWMC) on Wednesday, February 28, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.

 Inside Uwm Holdings Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Expense   Highlight
We establish a reserve which is estimated based on our assessment of our contingent and non-contingent obligations, including the universe of loans which may still be at risk for indemnity, expected frequency, appeal rate success, expected loss severity, expected economic conditions, as well as an estimate for the cost of a market participant’s potential readiness to stand by to perform on such obligations.



 Other - Other   Highlight
In addition, each of these facilities, as well as our secured and unsecured lines of credit, includes cross default or cross acceleration provisions that could result in all facilities terminating if an event of default or acceleration of maturity occurs under any facility.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
The decrease in salaries, commissions and benefits of $22.7 million, or 4.1%, was primarily due to a decrease in average team member count and lower incentive compensation as a result of lower production and profitability.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Changes in economic and other relevant conditions could cause actual results to differ from assumptions used to determine fair value.

 Other - Other   Highlight
IRLCs and loans at fair value expose us to the risk that the price of the existing loans and future loans to be made, which underlie the commitments, might decline in value due to increases in mortgage interest rates.
