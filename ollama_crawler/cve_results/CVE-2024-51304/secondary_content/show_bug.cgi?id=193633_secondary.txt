Description


Distfiles Failure Bot





          2007-09-24 12:20:36 UTC
        

The distfiles script failed to download the following file:
* mustang_v.3.tgz, 'exception all uri failed'

There could be several reasons for this, including changed upstream
DIST-files or wrong SRC_URIs.

The Distfiles Mirroring Changes Report (see URL field) has a current list
of failed files and explanations.

(Auto-filed bug by gen-bug.py, contact rbu@gentoo.org for complaints)
