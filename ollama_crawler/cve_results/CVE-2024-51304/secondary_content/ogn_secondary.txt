 Inside Organon Co.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Revenue - Product   Highlight
-54- Women's Health Contraception Worldwide sales of Nexplanon, a single-rod subdermal contraceptive implant, increased 8% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to the impact of favorable pricing and demand uptake in the United States, the favorable impact from the timing of tenders in Brazil and Latin America and volume growth from the institutional business in Africa.



 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Sales growth of 21% for the year ended December 31, 2022, was driven primarily by continued demand growth, favorable channel mix and favorable discount rates in the United States.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Worldwide sales were negatively impacted by approximately 6%, or $383 million, due to unfavorable foreign exchange.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
The effective income tax rate for the year ended 2021 also reflected a $75 million tax benefit relating to a portion of the non-U.S. step-up of tax basis, as well as the income tax benefit recognized in connection with the conclusion of the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") examination of Merck's 2015-2016 U.S. federal income tax returns.

 Other - Other   Highlight
