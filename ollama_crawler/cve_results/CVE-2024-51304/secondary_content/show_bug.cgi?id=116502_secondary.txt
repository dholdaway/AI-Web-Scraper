I struggled whole day getting wine working, because it segfaults on startup.
It turns out to be a simple opengl / xorg ATI fglrx configuration problem.

Please drop a note in pkg_preinst/postinst for ati users to 
add/modify 'Option "UseFastTLS" "2"' to the driver section in xorg.conf.

Maybe you can check the current opengl implementation with eselect and drop this warning if opengl is ati.

Regards,
Ruben
