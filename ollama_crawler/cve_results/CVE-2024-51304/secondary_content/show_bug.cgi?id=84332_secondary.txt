Description

No new entries on the top of the Changelog in the form:

*<PACKAGE_NAME>-<PACKAGE_VERSION>-<PACKAGE_RELEASE> (DD MMM YYYY)

for a version new bump of xorg-x11 (xorg-x11-6.8.2-r1). The new entries are inside xorg-x11-6.8.0-r5.

Most probably an echangelog related issue.


----------------------------

  xorg-x11-6.8.2-r1.ebuild:                              <---- orphaned entry?
  Stable on ppc.

*xorg-x11-6.8.0-r5 (05 Mar 2005)

  05 Mar 2005; Donnie Berkholz <spyderous@gentoo.org>;
  +xorg-x11-6.8.0-r5.ebuild, +xorg-x11-6.8.2-r1.ebuild:   <---- look here.
  (#83598, fd.o #1920) Fix more overflows in libXpm.

I wouldn't say the ChangeLog was borked.  Two versions were added at once (6.8.0-r6 and 6.8.2-r1); echangelog chose to report only one of them in a *new-version line.  That is how echangelog has always worked.

I've put a new version at http://gentoo.org/~agriffis/misc/echangelog which reports all new versions.  Mind trying it out for me?

Sorry about the `b0rked` word, yea in fact it isn't borked, maybe just have a missing entry...

Dont mind, I will try it for you. :-)

Yeah agriffis, the one in your devspace works.  I just noticed this bug when doing a bump.  It actually overwrites the previous entry with the new entry, but keeps the * Version line the same.

/me wonders how many ChangeLog entries he's overwritten in the last week :)

ka0ttic, I don't understand what you're saying.  Could you please post an example of the behavior you're seeing?

Are you able to repeat this a second time?  I tested, pretending to bump herdstat up to 0.4, and could not recreate the problem.  No offense intended, but I'm wondering if you could have somehow messed up the test?  If you could reproduce it a second time, that would be grand.

Well, to the best of my knowledge, this is fixed
