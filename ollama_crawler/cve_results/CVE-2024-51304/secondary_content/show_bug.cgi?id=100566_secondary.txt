In the install phase of kdelibs-3.4.2, I happened to see this scroll past:

=================== 
I.e. apparently fr.xml and iso-lat1.xml were downloaded in the process of 
validating some XML file or other that referenced them (I'm weak on DTDs, but 
kdoctools/docbook/xsl/common/l10n.xml references fr.xml etc).  
 
Ebuilds shouldn't download stuff in the install phase, so would be nice to fix 
this (presumably by disabling said xml validation). But I don't want to stop 
for this now, I need to get 3.4.2 out the door :-)

Weird, it doesn't happen here and I cannot find anything in the Makefiles that 
could explain it...

This is wild guessing, but maybe it's a validation mechanism that caches these 
files and you already had them downloaded? Anyway, I'll try to find out later 
what validation may be happening there.

Well, all the needed files seems to be already there in 
kdelibs/kdoctools/docbook/, including fr.xml and iso-lat1.ent...

I can't reproduce this, so if it's still active in today's latest KDE versions please reopen.
