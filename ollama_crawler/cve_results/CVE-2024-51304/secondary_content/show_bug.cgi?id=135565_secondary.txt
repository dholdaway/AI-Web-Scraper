I've just recompiled dev-lang/php-4.4.2-r2 after switching to the new php ebuild system but phpmyadmin stopped working with a 
[code]
Fatal error: Call to undefined function: preg_match() in /var/www/localhost/htdocs/phpmyadmin/libraries/defines.lib.php on line 36
[/code]
I've recompiled it with the "pcre" USE in make.conf and now dev-db/phpmyadmin works again.
So I think that phpmyadmin needs that USE.
But preg_match is used in every php program...

It does, re-emerge it and check for yourself.
