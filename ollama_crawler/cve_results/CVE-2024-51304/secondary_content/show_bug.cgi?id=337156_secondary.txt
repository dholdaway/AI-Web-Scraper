Well, yeah. but the same can be said about any other KDE4 application.
The difference is kinfocenter and systemsettings do not have standard application main menu with built-in 'Help'->'$application Handbook' menu item - which is otherwise provided by kdelibs.

kinfocenter and systemsettings provide 'Help' buttons on their own, hence manual 'kinfocenter' invocation.

Also - both kinfocenter and systemsettings have handbook USE flag for the purpose of manuals.

Unfortunately, we cannot do much about it:

- for kinfocenter/systemsettings one could - depending on handbook USE flag - comment out code that's responsible for adding that help button - this is actually doable - do provide consistency - USE flags vs what can be clicked.

- but... one cannot do the same for any other KDE4 apps since the code is in kdelibs

That being said I suggest WORKSFORME.
