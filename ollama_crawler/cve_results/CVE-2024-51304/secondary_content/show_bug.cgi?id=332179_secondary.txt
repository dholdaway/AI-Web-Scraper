As discussed in the URL above, /bin preferably should not be
linking against /usr as /usr might not be available.

$ ls -l /bin/*gawk
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Apr  2  2009 /bin/gawk -> gawk-3.1.6
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 20 Apr  2  2009 /bin/igawk -> /usr/bin/igawk-3.1.6
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 20 Apr  2  2009 /bin/pgawk -> /usr/bin/pgawk-3.1.6

Reproducible: Always

i knew i fixed this before ... you're probably using an older version of gawk

$ qlist -I -v gawk
sys-apps/gawk-3.1.8

$ qlist -v -e gawk | grep /bin
/bin/gawk
/bin/awk -> gawk
/usr/bin/pgawk
/usr/bin/gawk -> /bin/gawk
/usr/bin/igawk
/usr/bin/awk -> gawk

Sigh.  Yes, old version indeed.  Sorry for the noise.
