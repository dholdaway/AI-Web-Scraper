The MySQL upgrade guide says:
"Code ListingÂ 3.4: Configure MySQL 4.1 base setup 
# emerge --config =mysql-4.1.<micro_version> 
# /etc/init.d/mysql start"

However it's not clear if the user should only execute these command or also
execute what the output messages of the commands tell him to execute. Particularly
the command "emerge --config =mysql-4.1.14" tells me:
"
PLEASE REMEMBER TO SET A PASSWORD FOR THE MySQL root USER !
To do so, start the server, then issue the following commands:
/usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password'
/usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root -h kestrel password 'new-password'
See the manual for more instructions.
"

I suggest to write "perform these commands and do not perform what they
ask you what to do" or "perform these commands and after each of them
perform what it's output asks you to do" into the manual MySQL upgrade guide.

This is quite serious because is invoked for every user that wants to upgrade
gentoo and has MySQL installed and happens to cross the 4.0-4.1 version boundary.

The whole document is pretty clear to me, if it's unclear to you, then I'd suggest to hire someone to do the job properly for you. The document talks about *upgrading* of mysql install, which assumes that you had mysql set up and running before. The documents does *not* replace MySQL documentation.

For the record, /etc/init.d/mysql start' does not ask for any further actions, don't see what you mean there really.

"For the record, /etc/init.d/mysql start' does not ask for any further actions,
don't see what you mean there really." -> do you read the bugreports at all before you close them down? The response to your question is quotation from the bugreport:

"Particularly
the command "emerge --config =mysql-4.1.14" tells me:
\"
PLEASE REMEMBER TO SET A PASSWORD FOR THE MySQL root USER !
To do so, start the server, then issue the following commands:
/usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password'
/usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root -h kestrel password 'new-password'
See the manual for more instructions.
