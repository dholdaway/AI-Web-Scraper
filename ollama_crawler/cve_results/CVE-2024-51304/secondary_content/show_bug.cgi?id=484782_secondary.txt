Description

I was logged in gnome-classical, then I logged out and I did not got the gdm login menu. I only see the clock. If I press enter, I can login as user rose, but I can't login as an other user and I can't change the login session. Restarting gdm did not help.

root@leopard:/root(19)# qlist -Iv gnome-session
gnome-base/gnome-session-3.8.4
root@leopard:/root(20)# qlist -Iv gdm
gnome-base/gdm-3.8.4

Your description sounds like the gnome-shell lock screen for an existing session (e.g. what you get when waking up from suspend), not the gdm login screen...

Please review journalctl -e output (at the end) to try to find any useful error message. What systemd version are you running?

After the next reboot I could start gdm and got the login menu, I tried to login in the default gnome sessions, which failed with "Oh,No ...."

I switched to the console. After doing "systemctl reboot", I saw in the shutdown phase endless (more than 90 minutes until I cut the powerline):
...
[255***.******] nouveau W[  PFIFO][0000:01:00.0] INTR 0x01000000: 0x00000003

[260***.******] nouveau W[  PFIFO][0000:01:00.0] INTR 0x01000000: 0x00000005


After the next boot of the system, I removed all ~rose/.gnome*, ~rose/.config/dconf, ~rose/.config/gconf, ~rose/.config/gnome*, etc directories. Then I could login in the default gnome session.
And I can logout and get again the gdm menu.
