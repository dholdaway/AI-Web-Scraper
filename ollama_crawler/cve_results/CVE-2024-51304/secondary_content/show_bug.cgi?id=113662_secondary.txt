I'm trying to get a virtual/speech or at least a virtual/festival going for 
kttsd to depend on.  Without out, the plugins will not be built.  At the most 
there should be at least a virtual/festival, as most text to speech programs 
appear to utilize it.  Without it, KTTSD will not build the plugins (it doesn't 
see the appropriate programs to utilize the plugins) and no speech will be 
avaliable.
