Description

Upgrading from dnsmasq 2.22 may leave users mystified as to why it suddenly
stops working.  Apparently it started requiring two new kernel modules to
work.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge dnsmasq>2.22
2. /etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart

Actual Results:  
In /var/log/messages:

Feb 20 15:41:24 mecgentoo dnsmasq: failed to create listening socket: Protocol not available

dnsmasq failed to start.
dnsmasq fails to start.

Expected Results:  
It should work.

The nfnetlink and nfnetlink_log modules need to be loaded for dnsmasq>2.22
to work.  This problem took months to hunt down and kill;  a simple
notification in the ebuild would have been very, very helpful.

you cant turn off netlink in newer kernels, so this issue has pretty much expired
