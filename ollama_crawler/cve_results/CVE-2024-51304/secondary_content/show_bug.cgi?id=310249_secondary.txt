After installing the daisy plasma applet, clicking on any launcher causes two instances of the given application to be opened. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Emerge Daisy
2.Click on a launcher

Actual Results:  
The selected application is opened twice.

Expected Results:  
Only one instance of the selected application should exist, not two.

Sorry for the inconvenience. I was using KDE 4.3.5 and daisy 0.0.4.21 worked correctly while 0.0.4.22 exhibited the behavior described earlier. Now I'm using KDE 4.4.1 and 0.0.4.21 doesn't work but 0.0.4.22 does now.

So I don't think the bug is relevant anymore.

Closing then. Reopen if the problem reappears.
