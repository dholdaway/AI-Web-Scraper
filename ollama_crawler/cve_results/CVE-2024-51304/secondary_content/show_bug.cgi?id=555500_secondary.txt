After emerging the newest versions of evolution 3.16.3 and 3.16.4 neither of them is correctly working. Both versions open correctly, allow for reading email, but as soon as one clicks the button "new" or "reply" or tries to compose a new message, the mail client crashes with following error notice:

Gdk-ERROR **: The program 'evolution' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)'.
  (Details: serial 62501 error_code 11 request_code 53 (core protocol) minor_code 0)
  (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
   that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
   To debug your program, run it with the GDK_SYNCHRONIZE environment
   variable to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)


This error could be repeated with a complete new install of gentoo linux. 
installed versions:

x11-base/xorg-x11-7.4-r2
x11-libs/gtk+-3.16.5

please provide emerge --info output and a proper backtrace:

You will need to compile with debugging symbols also the packages providing the libs listed in backtrace that have "in ?? ()" (like gtk+3, glib, libX11...)

I also see you use gcc-4.9 even being "stable" amd64
