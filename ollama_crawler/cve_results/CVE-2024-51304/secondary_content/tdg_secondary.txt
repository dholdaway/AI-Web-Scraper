Exhibit 99.1                      TransDigm Group Reports Fiscal 2023 Fourth Quarter and Year-End Results, and Declares a Special Cash Dividend of $35.00 Per ShareCleveland, Ohio, November 9, 2023/PRNewswire/ -- TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE: TDG), a leading global designer, producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components, today reported results for the fourth quarter ended September 30, 2023. The Company also announced that its Board of Directors has authorized a special cash dividend of $35.00 on each outstanding share of common stock and cash dividend equivalent payments under options granted under its stock options plans. The record date for the special dividend is November 20, 2023, and the payment date for the dividend is November 27, 2023.Fourth quarter highlights include:•Net sales of $1,852 million, up 23% from $1,510 million in the prior year's quarter;•Income from continuing operations of $414 million, up 56% from the prior year's quarter;•Earnings per share from continuing operations of $7.23, up 82% from the prior year's quarter;•EBITDA As Defined of $963 million, up 28% from $752 million in the prior year's quarter;•EBITDA As Defined margin of 52.0%; and•Adjusted earnings per share of $8.03, up 46% from $5.50 in the prior year's quarter.Fiscal 2023 highlights include:•Net sales of $6,585 million, up 21% from $5,429 million in the prior fiscal year;•Income from continuing operations of $1,299 million, up 50% from the prior fiscal year;•Earnings per share from continuing operations of $22.03, up 65% from the prior fiscal year;•EBITDA As Defined of $3,395 million, up 28% from $2,646 million in the prior fiscal year;•EBITDA As Defined margin of 51.6%; and•Adjusted earnings per share of $25.84, up 51% from $17.14 in the prior fiscal year.Quarter-to-Date ResultsNet sales for the quarter increased 22.6%, or $342 million, to $1,852 million from $1,510 million in the comparable quarter a year ago. Organic sales growth as a percentage of net sales was 18.5%. Income from continuing operations for the quarter increased $148 million, or 55.6%, to $414 million from $266 million in the comparable quarter a year ago. The increase in income from continuing operations primarily reflects the increase in net sales described above, favorable sales mix and lower non-cash stock and deferred compensation expense. These favorable items contributing to the increase in income from continuing operations was partially offset by higher income tax expense, higher one-time refinancing costs and higher interest expense. 1The following information was filed by Transdigm Group Inc (TDG) on Thursday, November 9, 2023 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.

 Inside Transdigm Group Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Dividend   Highlight
Pursuant to the Fourth Amended and Restated TransDigm Group Incorporated 2006 Stock Incentive Plan Dividend Equivalent Plan, the Amended and Restated 2014 Stock Option Plan Dividend Equivalent Plan and the 2019 Stock Option Plan Dividend Equivalent Plan, all of the vested options granted under the existing stock option plans, except for grants to the members of the Board of Directors, are entitled to certain dividend equivalent payments in the event of the declaration of a dividend by the Company.



 Revenue - Product   Highlight
We believe we have achieved steady, long-term growth in sales and improvements in operating performance due to our competitive strengths and through execution of our value-driven operating strategy.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
A favorable sales mix, specifically, higher commercial aftermarket sales as a percentage of net sales compared to commercial OEM and defense net sales also contributed to the gross profit as a percentage of net sales increasing by 1.2 percentage points to 58.3% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 from 57.1% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.

 M & A - Other   Highlight
Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins, discount rates, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items.
