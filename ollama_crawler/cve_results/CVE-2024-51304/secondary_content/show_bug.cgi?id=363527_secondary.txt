# Generated by dhcpcd
# my resolv.conf
nameserver 127.0.0.1
domain localdomain
options timeout:60 attempts:1 inet6 ip6-dotint edns0


if i comment options, then ipv6 is disabled but that does not solve it, just hide the buffer overflow

have also tryed unstable libpcap and libnet library to find if it was a missing bump version, so far not solved it either

so a glibc bug ?

I have got "Bad destination address:" on each ipv6 address, supplied to tcptraceroute, so - probably obsolete. I am closing this as WORKSFORME, reopen if issue still happens.
