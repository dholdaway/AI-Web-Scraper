We need to know where you downloaded that file from.

1) Please post your `emerge --info' output in a comment.
2) Please attach the entire fetch log to this bug report.

Sorry Folks ...

I tried this on about three machines.  I support several operations.  Each has its own http-replicator server.  Most use tds and OUSL for mirrors.

I did download the source files from Linux from Scratch and GNUTLS.org, they got the same erant hash as posted here.

I just pulled a tar ball from one of the other machines, and it matched the other hash.  That would be a workaround!!!

I downloaded this file[1] from several machines over the world.

and get sha256 e27553981d48d9211a7e5e94f6e78c575205202a181c2345a1c8466ebf1d2219 as expected.
