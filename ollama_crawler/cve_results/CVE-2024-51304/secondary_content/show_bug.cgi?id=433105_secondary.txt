Hello, there appears to be a severe server congestion on mirrors.rit.edu/gentoo, every system I've tried on, same results, getting only 100-200 KB/Second, I have a 30 Mbps service, even reset both my router and modem, same results, tried restarting same results.  Thanks!

I can pull at 1M/s. I suggest that you use a different mirror that works better for you.
