Hi!
Any good reason not to implement gentoo-vm USE flag as in openjdk-bin packages?

Use flag is implemented but masked by base profile

# Georgy Yakovlev <gyakovlev@gentoo.org> (2019-01-17)
# Mask openjdk:8 for use as system java-vm until it's proven to work
dev-java/openjdk:8 gentoo-vm
dev-java/openjdk-bin:8 gentoo-vm
