Hi!
net-ftp/pure-ftpd has language support via --with-language=${PUREFTPD_LANG:=XXX.

Default, english is hardcoded in the ebuild. It would be cool, if there could be choosen a language over the LANG/USE Var?

Bad idea; would take whatever random thing that happens to be the first in your LINGUAS. And no, it's not hardcoded, just set PUREFTPD_LANG variable to some of the supported values if you don't want English.
