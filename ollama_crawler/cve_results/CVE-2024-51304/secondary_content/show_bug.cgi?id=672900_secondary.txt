"emerge net-libs/serf" throws a fetch error:

There are only files for version 1.3.9 on http://apache.mirrors.hoobly.com/serf/

Please set your GENTOO_MIRRORS variable in make.conf to a valid value (that's not blank) and you will be able to download 1.3.8-r*.

The files are mirrored in Gentoo for this exact purpose when upstreams feel all old versions should be pulled.

Thank you for the solution!

I had the GENTOO_MIRRORS point to http://mirror.switch.ch/ftp/mirror/gentoo/ which was decommissioned some time ago.

I now switched to https://mirror.init7.net/gentoo/ and the install works.

BTW: This new mirror is not listed in https://gentoo.org/downloads/mirrors/. Who is responsible for this list?
