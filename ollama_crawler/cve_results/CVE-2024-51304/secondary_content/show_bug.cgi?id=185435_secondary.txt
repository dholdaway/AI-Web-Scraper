Hi,

It could be nice to get rid of pam_stack.so in mailbase package:
- /etc/pam.d/imap
- /etc/pam.d/imap4
- /etc/pam.d/imap4s
- /etc/pam.d/imaps
- /etc/pam.d/pop3d

Reproducible: Always

It's just fine w/ mailbase-1; all those files are symlinks to /etc/pam.d/{pop,imap}

# cat /etc/pam.d/{pop,imap}
# Provided by mailbase (dont remove this line!)
# Standard pam.d file for mail service packages.
# $Header: /var/cvsroot/gentoo-x86/net-mail/mailbase/files/common-pamd-include,v 1.1 2005/04/29 13:07:50 ticho Exp $

auth       required     pam_nologin.so
auth       include      system-auth
account    include      system-auth
session    include      system-auth

Hi,

I've just removed the files and reemerge net-mail/mailbase and it works. Should have been a etc-update problem.
