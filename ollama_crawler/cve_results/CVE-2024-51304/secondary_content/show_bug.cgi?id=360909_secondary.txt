Today it gave me :

rsync://mirror.cambrium.nl/gentoo/
and
http://mirror.cambrium.nl/pub/os/linux/gentoo/


Reproducible: Always

Which mirrorselect options did you use? I'm asking since the --rsync seems to control where the input URLs come from. Looking at mirrorselect's get_filesystem_mirrors function, it looks like on or more URLs might be coming directly from either the SYNC or GENTOO_MIRRORS variables in /etc/make.conf.

I use "mirrorselect -s 4" - mostly I use "-h" too, but here not.
