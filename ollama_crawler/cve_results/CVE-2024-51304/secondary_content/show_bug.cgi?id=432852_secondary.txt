The SVN repo doesn't exist anymore:

 * subversion check out start -->

svn: E170000: URL 'svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/KDE/yakuake' doesn't exist

Yakuake has been migrated to Git:

Works for me. Maybe something is on your system cached, because we set git as default scm in the eclass. 

See http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=proj/kde.git;a=commit;h=57f90d5e484a7d7e4435d98dfba27dc973ac6f76

I'm using the portage eclass (they have the same name, so there's a clash.)

I guess I have no other option than to maintain my own ebuild for this.  Sorry for the noise.

Or, if you could apply the commit to the portage version of kde4-functions.eclass, that would be awesome.

I have to verify to not break the tree first. But will do this soon.
