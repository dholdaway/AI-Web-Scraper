Xorg log

After upgrading to mesa 21.01, I cannot start X. My GPU is a Radeon RX480, and I've been using it with amdgpu and gentoo for a few years with no issues. See that attached Xorg log for details.

Downgrading to mesa 21.0.0 solved the problem.

Oh, nice. Could you please file an issue upstream at https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues ?

I can't confirm with my Radeon RX550

however I diffed the two mesa tarballs, there is just one patch it seems related to the amd backend. Maybe you can revert these changes locally to find the regression very easily? 

ping me if you need any additional information

Sorry for the delay. I just built mesa-21.0.1 so I could try reverting those changes that #3 suggested, but oddly enough I cannot reproduce the issue (before reverting anything)... I'm not sure how this is possible, I checked the history of the ebuild and it doesn't look like any recent changes could have contributed to resolving this.
