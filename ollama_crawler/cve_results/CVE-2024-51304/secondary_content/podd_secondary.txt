Changes to the actual replacement rates, which are evaluated quarterly, could have a material impact on our estimated warranty reserve.



 Financial - Earnings   Highlight

 Financial - Debt   Highlight
Additionally, we have a seven year term loan, which matures in 2028, that contains covenants restricting or limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make asset dispositions, create or permit liens, sell, transfer or exchange assets, guarantee certain indebtedness, and make acquisitions and other investments.

Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in market interest rates.
