Description

When I want to read a gpg encrypted message, the pinentry pops up and asking for a password. The problem is I can't copy paste my password and can't even move that window. It's kinda frozen.

Thunderbird: 45.2.0
Enigmail: 1.9.4 (20160704-1534)
Mate: 1.10.0-r2(22:36:31 26.07.2016)

Thanks!

Reproducible: Always

Ok, seems that was a missing feature at the application: app-crypt/pinentry. So I installed Version 0.9.7 and no copy an paste is supported.
