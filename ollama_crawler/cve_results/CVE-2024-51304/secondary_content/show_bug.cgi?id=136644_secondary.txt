emerge --info might fit here, but its not relevant.  mysql-extras is missing from the mirrors so the update fails.  The error follows:

--02:51:36--  http://gentoo.osuosl.org/distfiles/mysql-extras-20060410.tar.bz2
           => `/usr/portage/distfiles/mysql-extras-20060410.tar.bz2'

I just tried to upgrade a mysql-5.0.19 to 5.0.19-r1 and got the same error:

The file is not missing as that file shouldn't be downloaded anymore, the name of the patchsets changed. You probably have an old Portage tree checkout or some overlay that interferes, try commenting the PORTDIR_OVERLAY variable in make.conf and then emerge --sync again.
Best regards, CHTEKK.
