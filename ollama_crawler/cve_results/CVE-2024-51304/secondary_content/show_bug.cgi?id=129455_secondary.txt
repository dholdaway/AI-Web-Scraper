Description

To reproduce:

1) just start SciTE
2) type shift-F (to get a capital F)
3) type ctrl-F (to get the search dialog)

Then SciTE just crashes.

I already have this problem for a while, but until today I didn't have a way to reproduce it. I think (but I'm not sure) that the crashes started occurring after I switched to modular X. It occurs in both versions 1.62 and 1.68. I upgraded from 1.62 to 1.68 to see if the problem had been solved but apparently it hasn't. And it occurs in both the Gentoo version and the 'official' version from scintilla.sourceforge.net if compiled from source.

I built it from the official sources with debug info enabled and got this stack trace:

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
[Switching to Thread 16384 (LWP 9534)]

    stack_end=0xbfa89b0c) at libc-start.c:240
#10 0x080507a1 in _start () at start.S:119

The error seems to be somewhere in GTK. I already tried a revdep-rebuild (because I think the crashes started when I upgraded to modular X), but my system seems to be consistent. SciTE seems to be the only app with this problem on my system.

Indeed. The program no longer crashes. Works for me now too.
