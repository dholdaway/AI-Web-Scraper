Details
Philip Mackenzie, Marius Schilder, Jason Waddle and Ben Laurie of
Google Security discovered that the OpenSSL library did not
sufficiently check the padding of PKCS #1 v1.5 signatures if the
exponent of the public key is 3 (which is widely used for CAs). This
could be exploited to forge signatures without the need of the secret
key.

Update instructions
The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:
Ubuntu 6.06


              
                libssl0.9.8
              
              -
              
                0.9.8a-7ubuntu0.1
              
              





Ubuntu 5.10


              
                libssl0.9.7
              
              -
              
                0.9.7g-1ubuntu1.2
              
              





Ubuntu 5.04


              
                libssl0.9.7
              
              -
              
                0.9.7e-3ubuntu0.3

effect the necessary changes.
