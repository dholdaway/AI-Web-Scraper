Hi,

My SYNC is set to rsync://rsync.europe.gentoo.org/gentoo-portage.
Each time I hit ftp.heanet.ie, the sync is really sloooooooow (2 to 4 KB/s).
I must kill rsync and restart emerge --sync.

Reproducible: Always

Trying just now did not saturate my downstream, but I still got ~1Mbit/s. I think that's an acceptable speed still.

Does not work here from France. From 2 to 6 KB/s.
Must kill rsync each time I hit this server.

I suggest you restrict syncing to other mirrors then. rsync.fr.g.o?
