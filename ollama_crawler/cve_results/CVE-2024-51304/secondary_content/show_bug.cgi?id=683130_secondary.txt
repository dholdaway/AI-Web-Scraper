Hi!

I'm using KDE now and I had to rebuilt everything. I rebuilt pinentry without the USE="gnome-keyring" and then clean perfectly with emerge -c. In the cleaning process, it removes libsecret.

However, the only app that claims libsecret is skypeforlinux, as shown below:


!!! existing preserved libs:
>>> package: app-crypt/libsecret-0.18.8
 *  - /usr/lib64/libsecret-1.so.0
 *  - /usr/lib64/libsecret-1.so.0.0.0
 *      used by /opt/skypeforlinux/resources/app.asar.unpacked/node_modules/keytar/build/Release/keytar.node (net-im/skypeforlinux-8.34.0.78-r1)
Use emerge @preserved-rebuild to rebuild packages using these libraries


Thanks.

Reproducible: Always

This is a known issue,

skypeforlinux is based on electron which is basically an old version of chromium, that old chromium version used to require gconf as well as libsecret to function.
But the actual skypeforlinux application doesn't need those libraries to function.

I'm willing to add a gnome-keyring use flag to this package but I don't think its required..

Ok, so... why close it then?
I reinstalled skypeforlinux, tried to run it but it crashes everytime, even after I cleaned all configuration files.
