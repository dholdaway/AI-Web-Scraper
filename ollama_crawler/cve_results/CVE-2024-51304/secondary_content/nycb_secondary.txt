 Inside New York Community Bancorp Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Portfolio prepayments are subject to estimation uncertainty and changes in this assumption could have a material impact to our estimation process.



 Other - Other   Highlight
The allowance for credit losses on loans and leases represents our current estimate of the lifetime credit losses expected from our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded lending commitments.

 Other - Other   Highlight
We significantly built our reserve levels by recording a $552 million provision for loan losses, bringing our allowance for credit losses to $992 million at December 31, 2023, reflecting our actions to build reserves during the quarter to address weakness in the office sector, potential repricing risk in the multi-family portfolio and conditions leading to increases in classified assets, which better aligns the Company with its relevant bank peers, including Category IV banks.

 Other - Other   Highlight
The allowance for credit losses on loans and leases increased $599 million from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023.
