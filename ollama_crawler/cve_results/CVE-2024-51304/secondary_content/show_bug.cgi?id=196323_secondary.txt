Is it possible to make the "Reloading configuration and flushing all queues" more userfriendly? I have got several hosts to log and so several includes in the /etc/tenshi/tenshi.conf. It is really annoying when one of the included files changed, I need to reload and the whole queues were flushed.

So I think the " kill -HUP `cat /var/lib/tenshi/tenshi.pid` &>/dev/null " is a bad idea when tenshi takes the queues and throw them away. Is it possible if tenshi got a -HUP that it mails the queues? I don't want to lose the log output while tenshi "reloads".


Regards,
Sebastian
