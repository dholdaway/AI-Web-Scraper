It lacks such termtypes as xterm-256color and xterm-88color for example.

coreutils-5.2.1-r6 files on my machine are dated Jul 8 and /usr/portage/sys-
apps/coreutils/files/DIR_COLORS file is dated Sep 13, so you must forgive me. 
Nevertheless, the colorizable termtype list is still incomplete - xterm-16color, 
xterm-88color, xterm-pcolor (is this one colorizable?) are not in the list 
(along with some oters, i think).

BTW, debian does not have a xterm-256color terminfo file and the xterm-color is 
a 256-color one.

there are a ton of terminals which support colors, we dont add every single one
for obvious reasons, just the ones people use

if you actually use xterm-16color/xterm-88color/xterm-pcolor, i will add them,
otherwise i wont bother
