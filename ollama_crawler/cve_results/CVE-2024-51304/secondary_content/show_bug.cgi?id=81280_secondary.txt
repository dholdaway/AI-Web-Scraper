It's only noticible if you press F2 in time to go to verbose mode.  Only pushing power off will turn off the computer.

I just used the kernel that booted by default.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start the computer with the Gentoo 2004.3 Minimal LiveCD
2.Use "reboot" to reboot (or probably shutdown -h now to shutdown)
3.

Actual Results:  
Freezes

Expected Results:  
Shuts down cleanly

What if you try with either doapm or acpi=on, as the default is to *not* have any power management enabled, which means the computer will *not* turn itself off.

Are you booting with the CD and chrooting into an installation and then trying to reboot or is it really directly off the installation-cd? I am asking because you are posting an "emerge info"; emerge is not available on installation-cds.

I just posted the emerge info because that's what the bug reporting seems to say you should do.  If I remember, it froze even after I exited from the chroot environment.

I doubt it's a problem with power management because the progress meter wasn't 100% full when it froze without using the verbose mode.  And I think a computer can reboot without power management...

You said shutdown.  This implies a poweroff, not a reboot.  If this is not the case, then you didn't make yourself clear enough in the original bug post.

Now that you've made it more apparent what the problem is, we won't be looking for the solution to the wrong one... =]

No, it's you who didn't read the bug report carefully.  Beside step 2 I mention rebooting.  Shutdown, from my understanding, means bringing the system and all its services down, and possibly starting it up again (that's why rebooting can be done with the shutdown command).

Wow... thanks for being such an understanding person... your compassion must just ooze out of you...

Anyway... I'm not bothering with this bug anymore, since it is obvious that Adam isn't interested in my help.

beejay: this one is all yours...

I wasn't trying to be difficult, I was just pointing something out.  Anyway, I've already installed Gentoo, so I don't need help with this - I just noticed something wrong with the CD while installing it and thought I should tell you guys.

I'm sorry if I made it seem like I was insulting you, Chris.  Often I talk bluntly because it's efficient, but sometimes it causes misunderstandings so I should probably stop doing so.  If you want me to try anything else to try to fix this problem, I'd probably be willing to try it (or explain why I'm sure it's not the problem).  Of course, with this type of thing there's always a chance the hardware (in this case my motherboard) is broken, but I don't get the error when the USB hotplugging is stopped on my installed Gentoo system, so that seems unlikely.
