Description

steps to reproduce: download systemc-2.2.0.tgz.tar from www.systemc.org and place it in /usr/portage/distfiles then:
emerge systemc
fails with:

resolution:

The systemc tarball downloadable from www.systemc.org has apparently been renamed to "systemc-2.2.0.tgz.tar" while the filename in the ebuild is "systemc-2.2.0.tgz". because of this the emerge fails. edit the ebuild and change the line SRC_URI="${P}.tgz" to SRC_URI="${P}.tgz.tar" afterwards rebuild the manifest with "ebuild systemc-2.2.0.ebuild manifest".

now the package shoukd compile!

p.s. please be patient with me if i do not follow some of the bug-reporting guidelines, this is my first bug-report! ;-)

I can not reproduce your mentioned behaviour. Just made a fresh download of the tarbal. It is is correctly named upstream as systemc-2.2.0.tgz. Works like a charme here.
