When I type "about:plugins" in the adress bar of mozilla, the list of plugins remains empty. I also get this error when I choose "help - about Mozilla firefox" in the menu:

Erreur d'analyse XML : erreur dans le traitement d'une référence d'entité externe
Emplacement : chrome://browser/content/aboutDialog.xul
Numéro de ligne 9, Colonne 1 :%brandDTD;


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open mozilla-firefox and type about:plugins in the adress bar
2.notice that the list of plugins doesn't appear.
3.

Actual Results:  
the list remains empty

Expected Results:  
show the list of plugins

I should add that this problem after an upgrade from xulrunner 1.9-r2 to 1.9.0.1.

I have just rebuild xulrunner 1.9.0.1 and the problem doesn't occur anymore. I find that quite strange.

Maybe mozilla@ has an explanation? :)

I did the same upgrade on another computer and the problem didn't occur. So, this remains a mystery.
