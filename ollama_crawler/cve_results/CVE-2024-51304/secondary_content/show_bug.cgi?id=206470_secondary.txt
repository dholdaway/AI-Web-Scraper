I recently upgraded from unrar-3.7.3 to 3.7.8, and started receiving weird amavisd failures.

I tracked it down to a broken av- option:

unrar-3.7.3:

/usr/bin/unrar v -c- -p- -av- -idcdp -- /tmp/test.rar

Archive /tmp/test.rar

unrar-3.7.8:

/usr/bin/unrar v -c- -p- -av- -idcdp -- /tmp/test.rar

ERROR: Unknown option: av-


It's still documented in the 3.7.8 help output:

<Switches>
[...]
  av-           Disable authenticity verification check


Maybe this version should be masked pending resolution?

Based on forum postings, looks like 3.7.5 is broken too.

well, it isnt a matter of unrar-3.7.5+ not supporting it, it's a matter of unrar-3.7.3 and older not flagging it as unsupported

with older versions, anything invalid coming after -a was ignored

the verification stuff is supposed to be only in the "paid for" version ...

is there any way around this yet?  (be it via unrar, or via amavisd-new)

it seems unrar-3.7.3 is gone from portage.

create a local unrar script that removes the av option from the cmd line before executing the real unrar

unrar 3.8.5 is an oldest version available in Portage now, and av- option is not documented and supported here. This bug report become objectiveless in 2010.
