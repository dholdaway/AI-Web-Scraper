after the recent apache update (to version apache-2.0.59-r5) my systems dont seem to have the apache2ctl binary anymore.

santa vhosts.d # which apache2ctl
which: no apache2ctl in (/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/opt/bin:/usr/i686-pc-linux-gnu/gcc-bin/4.1.2:/usr/i686-pc-linux-gnu/gcc-bin/4.1.1)

i do have app-admin/apache-tools-2.2.4-r4 installed.
thanks
kind regards
Thilo

please sync and remerge apache, 2.0.59-r5 should also block apache-tools. there was a bug in the dependencies ...
