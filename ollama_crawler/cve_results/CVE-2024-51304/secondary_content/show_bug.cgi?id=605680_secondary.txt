as in summary, there is no mpich2 multilib which could satisfy virtual

Christoph, did you mean to do this for mpich2 and mvapich2? Neither support multilib.

Yes, abi_x86_64(-) etc. mean assume no multilib support by default and mpich2 and mvapich2 don't have multilib support and hence they don't fulfill the boost's dependency of multilib mpi.

So what should we be doing here?  Do we need to remove mvapich2 and mpich2 from the virtual?

Ah, but seems stale.
