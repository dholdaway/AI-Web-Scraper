This process is thought to involve netrin-1 attraction. However, whereas the cell bodies of LRN neurons cross the midline, IO neurons are unable to do so. In many systems and species, axon guidance and cell migration at the midline are controlled by Slits and their receptor Robos. We showed previously that precerebellar axons and neurons do not cross the midline in the absence of the Robo3 receptor. To determine whether this signaling by Slits and the two other Robo receptors, Robo1 and Robo2, also regulates precerebellar neuron behavior at the floor plate, we studied the phenotype of Slit1/2 and Robo1/2/3 compound mutants. Our results showed that many IO neurons can cross the midline in absence of Slit1/2 or Robo1/2, supporting a role for midline repellents in guiding precerebellar neurons. We also show that these molecules control the development of the lamellation of the inferior olivary complex. Last, the analysis of Robo1/2/3 triple mutants suggests that Robo3 inhibits Robo1/2 repulsion in precrossing LRN axons but not in IO axons in which it has a dominant and distinct function.Soc NeuroscienceShow moreShow lessSave Cite Cited by 60 Related articles All 17 versions  PrivacyTermsHelpAbout ScholarSearch help
