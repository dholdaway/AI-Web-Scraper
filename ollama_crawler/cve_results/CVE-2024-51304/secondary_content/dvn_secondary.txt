 Devon Energy Corporation 333 West Sheridan
Avenue Oklahoma City, OK 73102-5015
 Devon Energy Reports Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2023 Results; Declares Quarterly Dividend and Raises Fixed Dividend by 10
Percent in 2024  OKLAHOMA CITY  Feb. 27, 2024  Devon Energy Corp. (NYSE: DVN) today reported financial and operational results for
the fourth-quarter and full-year 2023. Supplemental financial tables and forward-looking guidance are available on the companys website at www.devonenergy.com. 
KEY FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS   


 

 
 Fourth-quarter production exceeds top end of guidance range, averaging 662,000
oil-equivalent barrels per day   


 

 
 Delaware Basin production increased 6 percent year over year, driving results that were favorable to
guidance   


 

 
 Record-setting oil volumes drove an 8 percent increase in total production during 2023
  


 

 
 Operating cash flow totaled $6.5 billion and free cash flow reached $2.7 billion in 2023
  


 

 
 Declared fixed-plus-variable dividend payout of $0.44 per share based on fourth quarter results
  


 

 
 Repurchased 5.2 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $234 million in the fourth quarter
  


 

 
 Balance sheet continued to strengthen with cash balances increasing $114 million to a total of
$875 million   


 

 
 2024 outlook reaffirmed with capital objectives designed to improve efficiency and drive per-share growth   


 

 
 Board approved a 10 percent increase to the fixed quarterly dividend 
CEO PERSPECTIVE  Devon exited 2023 with positive
momentum, delivering a solid quarter of execution that surpassed our operational and financial targets, said Rick Muncrief, president and CEO. This performance rounded out another year of accomplishment, headlined by record-setting oil
production and $2.7 billion of free cash flow generation. These achievements allowed us to reward shareholders with an impressive cash-return yield of 10 percent, balanced between buybacks and dividends. 
Looking ahead to 2024, we have designed a plan to deliver a step-change improvement in capital efficiency. By allocating additional capital to the core
of the Delaware Basin and high-grading activity across our diversified portfolio, we expect to efficiently sustain our oil production for roughly 10 percent less capital. 
This disciplined plan prioritizes value over volume and is expected to result in another year of differentiated cash returns versus the broader market.
The boards approval of a 10 percent increase to the fixed dividend further underscores our confidence in the plan and the underlying financial strength of our business, Muncrief commented. 
FINANCIAL RESULTS  Devon reported net earnings of
$1.2 billion, or $1.81 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2023. Adjusting for items analysts typically exclude from estimates, the companys core earnings were $902 million, or $1.41 per diluted share. 
Operating cash flow totaled $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter, representing the highest quarterly amount of the year. This level of cash flow funded
Devons capital requirements and resulted in $827 million of free cash flow in the quarter. For the full-year 2023, operating cash flow totaled $6.5 billion and free cash flow reached $2.7 billion. 
The companys investment-grade financial position continued to strengthen in the fourth quarter with cash balances increasing by $114 million to a
total of $875 million. The company exited the year with outstanding debt of $6.2 billion and a net debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of 0.7 times.

 Inside Devon Energy Corpde's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
The market price for crude oil is currently expected to be lower in 2024 due to concerns of a global economic slowdown driven by high interest rates and high inflation that could weaken economic activity and oil demand.



 Financial - Debt   Highlight
However, a downgrade could adversely impact our interest rate on any credit facility borrowings and the ability to economically access debt markets in the future.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Growing supply from U.S. oil producers could also weigh down prices in 2024 by dampening the impact of OPEC+ supply cuts.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
The currently elevated level of cost inflation has eroded, and could continue to erode, our cost efficiencies gained over previous years and pressure our margin in 2024.
