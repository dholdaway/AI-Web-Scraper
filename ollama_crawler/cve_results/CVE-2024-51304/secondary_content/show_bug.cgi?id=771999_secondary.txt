For emerge --resume commands, it would make sense for emerge --keep-going to automatically drop packages with unsatisfied dependencies.

The emerge --keep-going option currently does not affect the dependency calculation in any way. So, the dependency calculation is the same whether it occurs due to a --keep-going restart or due to an emerge --resume invocation.
