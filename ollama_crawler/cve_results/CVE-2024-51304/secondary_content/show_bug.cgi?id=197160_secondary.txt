Description


Algardas Pelakauskas





          2007-10-26 17:23:05 UTC
        

sci-calculators/pcalc-1.0.0-r1 had
DEPEND="sys-devel/flex
        sys-devel/bison",

whereas sci-calculators/pcalc-1.1 has
DEPEND="",

but pcalc-1.1 still depends on both.

sys-devel/flex is part of system, see $PORTDIR/profiles/base/packages

You're right. Sorry.

The system I encountered this on was installed a long time ago and is little bit messed up...
