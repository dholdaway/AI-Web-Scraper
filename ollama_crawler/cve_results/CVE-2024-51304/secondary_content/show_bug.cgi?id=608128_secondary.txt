Hey,
while using app-emulation/vagrant-1.9.1 from the tree, it return me a 'error' after certain commands (help, global-status, etc) :
$ vagrant
Ignoring curses-1.0.1 because its extensions are not built.  Try: gem pristine curses --version 1.0.1

So maybe the ebuild did not pull the right lib behind the gem, are you getting the same error ?

$ vagrant -v
Vagrant 1.9.1

$ vagrant 
Usage: vagrant [options] <command> [<args>]

    -v, --version                    Print the version and exit.
    -h, --help                       Print this help.

...

Probably some ruby dep got upgraded, I'll try to update my system if I can reproduce it.

Hey Tomáš,
Yes I confirm this is not happening anymore,
maybe it is somehow related to 608522 ?

$ vagrant -v
Vagrant 1.9.1

Maybe, but it would print the error like in that bug report. Please reopen if it happens again.
