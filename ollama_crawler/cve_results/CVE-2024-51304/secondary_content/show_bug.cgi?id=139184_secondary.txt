Description


ProTech





          2006-07-04 07:26:12 UTC
        

Updated to the now stable X.Org 7.0 and have problem with dependencies of the x11-libs/libXext-1.0.1
 package:

checking for XEXT... configure: error: Package requirements (xproto x11 xextproto xau) were not met:



No package 'x11' found

No package 'xau' found



I solved the problem by emerging the missing libs with the following commands:
emerge -1va x11-libs/libXau

emerge -1va x11-libs/libX11

From libXext:

RDEPEND="x11-libs/libX11"

libXau is pulled in as well.  This is probably the weird Portage bug that we haven't been able to track down yet (or whatever is causing it).
