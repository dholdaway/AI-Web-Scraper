Description


Andreas Proteus





          2011-02-07 17:20:55 UTC
        

emerge -avuD   world
emerge: there are no ebuilds to satisfy ">=dev-python/PyQt4-4.8.2[dbus,declarative,sql,svg,webkit,X]".
(dependency required by "kde-base/pykde4-4.6.0" [ebuild])
(dependency required by "kde-base/plasma-workspace-4.6.0[python]" [ebuild])
(dependency required by "kde-base/kdebase-meta-4.6.0" [ebuild])
(dependency required by "kde-base/kde-meta-4.6.0" [ebuild])
(dependency required by "@selected" [set])
(dependency required by "@world" [argument]

From the file /etc/portage/package.use:
dev-python/PyQt4 dbus declarative sql svg webkit X
all the required flags are set.

However when I do:
emerge -1va PyQt4
[ebuild   R    ] dev-python/PyQt4-4.8.3  USE="X dbus kde opengl sql svg webkit -assistant -debug (-declarative) -doc -examples -multimedia -phonon -xmlpatterns" 0 kB        
the declarative flag is not accepted.

Any ideas?

Reproducible: Always

It's use.masked somehow.

Nothing in the tree appears to do that so I find myself looking squarely at your </home/portage/overlay> and nodding suggestively toward your </etc/portage/{package.,}use.mask>.

(In reply to comment #2)
Thank for the prompt reply. 
Can you please be more specific as to what may be the cause.

I set:  PORTDIR_OVERLAY=""
I deleted everything: rm -R  /etc/portage/*

and when I do:
USE="declarative sql webkit" emerge -vp PyQt4
I still get:
[ebuild   R    ] dev-python/PyQt4-4.8.3  USE="X dbus kde opengl sql svg webkit -assistant -debug (-declarative) -doc -examples -multimedia -phonon -xmlpatterns" 0 kB
