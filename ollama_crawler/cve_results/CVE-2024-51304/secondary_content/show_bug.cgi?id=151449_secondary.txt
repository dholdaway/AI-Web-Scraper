I've started to see this reasonable often, with 3 seperate machines now (ppc64/amd64/x86), so I'm wondering if a bug has snuck into OpenSSH.

In short, I keep a lot of SSH sessions open, in pairs between 3 machines. Recently (last month or so, but starting before the latest openssh-4.4 releases), I've gotten errors where my ssh connection has been terminated, and the only output is:
"Disconnected: Corrupted MAC on Input"

Googling said this has turned up before using a commercial SSH client to connect to OpenSSH, but that's definetly not the case here, the boxes are 100% OpenSSH.

Reproducing is hard. In short, open a shell connection, and push at least 2Gb of traffic through it. X-forwarding works well for generating said traffic, and that's what I use here (over gigabit).

It's not specific to RAM in any one box, I've seen it with all possible combinations of boxes, and I swapped RAM in one to make even more certain.

emerge --info output for all 3 machines is in the attachment, since bugzie hates 12k of data.

Closing my own bug, it's gotten a lot harder to reproduce lately.
