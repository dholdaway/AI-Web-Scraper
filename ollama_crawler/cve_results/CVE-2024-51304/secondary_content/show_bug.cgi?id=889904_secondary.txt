two different test cases fail in the latest 0.6.13 version.
I have filed an upstream report here:
https://github.com/emcconville/wand/issues/658

I'm not able to reproduce that error with the latest version (0.6.13).
Also my issue is already addressed by the ebuild, it is enforced by test? ( media-gfx/imagemagick[fftw,jpeg,png,truetype,xml]), as highlighted by upstream.

Please double-check and consider closing it.

OK let's close this and see if it pops again during automated testing.

It needs python[debug].

I can't reproduce even with USE=debug for python. Can you?
