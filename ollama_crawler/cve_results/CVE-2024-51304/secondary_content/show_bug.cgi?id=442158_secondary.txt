Description

The handbook has random errors in chapter listing (numbering).

"random" because at times the listings are OK but many times they're not.

For example:
http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?style=printable&full=1

shows:

"
7. Configuring the Kernel

2.a. Timezone

[...]

7.b. Installing the Sources
"

Expecting: "7.a. Timezone"

There are more such listing errors in the document.

this displays correctly in the regular version:

http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=1&chap=7

...so something about the printable version is messing up the numbering.

Correct but not all printable versions display the "error".

http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=1&chap=7&style=printable
displays fine.

http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?style=printable&full=1
doesn't.

Curiously though the following hand-crafted nonsense URL has the correct listing even though styling seems to be different:
http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=1&chap=7&style=printable&full=1
(the full document is correctly listed with style=printable)

I'm not seeing this behavior anymore, even though the handbook.xsl stylesheet hasn't been touched since 2009-07-12.

I'll mark this as WORKSFORME.

Reopen while yelling that I'm blind and pointing me to the URL (I tried http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?style=printable&full=1 and nada) is acceptable ;-)
