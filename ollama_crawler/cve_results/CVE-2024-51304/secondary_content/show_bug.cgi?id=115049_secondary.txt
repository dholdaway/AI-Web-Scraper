Open Edit->Keyboard shortcurts.
Click on any shortcut.
Type any key with the Hyper modifier (this is typically the "Windows" keys).
The key is wrongly recognized.

Philippe,

Is your patch still needed for newer version of gnome-terminal? The upstream bug you opened seemed to indicates your patch doesn't work. If this bug is still present, don't hesitate to reopen this bug, and if you can, to provide an updated patch (that hopefully works) for gnome-terminal-2.16

Thanks
