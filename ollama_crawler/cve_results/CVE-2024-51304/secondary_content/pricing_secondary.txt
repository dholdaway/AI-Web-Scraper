            Data residency
          




GitHub Enterprise Cloud offers a multi-tenant enterprise SaaS solution on Microsoft Azure, allowing you to choose a regional cloud deployment for data residency, so your in-scope data is stored at rest in a designated location. This is available in the EU with additional regions coming soon. Contact our sales team to learn more.













            Enterprise Managed Users

            Enterprise Account to centrally manage multiple organizations
          




GitHub Enterprise Cloud includes the option to create an enterprise account, which enables collaboration between multiple organizations, gives administrators a single point of visibility and management and brings license cost savings for identical users in multiple organizations.













            Environment protection rules
          




When a workflow job references an environment, the job won't start until all of the environment's protection rules pass.













            Repository rules
          




Enforce branch and tag restrictions across your organization, ensuring branch and tag protection across your repositories. Evaluate rules to asses impact before enforcement.

As a GitHub Enterprise Cloud organization administrator, you can now access log events using our GraphQL API and monitor the activity in your organization.

            FedRAMP Tailored Authority to Operate (ATO)
          




Government users can host projects on GitHub Enterprise Cloud with the confidence that our platform meets the low impact software-as-a-service (SaaS) baseline of security standards set by our U.S. federal government partners.

“GitHub is the world’s mono repository, so sharing our open source there is natural.”
                
— Martin Andersen, VP of Engineering, Trustpilot

    Read the case study 




“GitHub Advanced Security is there for every pull request and excels compared to other static analysis tools we have used.”
                
— Dimosthenis Kaponis, CTO, Netdata

    Read the case study 




“GitHub keeps us up to speed with the industry’s best tools. We want new hires to know GitHub is in our toolchain—it makes them excited to join us.”
                
— Spencer Kaiser, Principal Architect of Emerging Tech, American Airlines

    Read the case study 




“This collaborative way of building software is unstoppable. It isn’t going away—and GitHub has its place in that. We can make the whole company rethink how they build software.”
                
— Ingo Sauerzapf, SAP Cloud Development Tools Manager

    Read the case study 




“People know what a pull request is because it’s how they contribute to open source projects. We have many developers who are well-versed with GitHub, either for personal development or previous roles. With GitHub Enterprise, no one has to relearn the wheel.”
                
— Laurent Ploix, Product Manager, Spotify

    Read the case study 




“I have seen some truly revolutionary actions happen in communities on GitHub. People are collaborating on code but they’re also having foundational conversations on best practices and how software, as a whole, is built. More and more, GitHub is an internet archive. It’s a deeply social and critical piece of our infrastructure.”
                
— Michael Glukhovsky, Developer, Stripe

    Read the case study 




“When we started talking about code reuse, we felt like we already had the perfect platform in place: GitHub.”
                
— Timothy Carmean, Software Processes and Tools Supervisor, Ford

    Read the case study 




“Using GitHub Enterprise Cloud removes the burden of managing infrastructure, and we don’t need to worry about the availability of our versioning code, source code and versioning tools. It lets us focus on what’s important for our business, and that’s our customers.”
                
— Victor Gomes, Infosec Tech Manager, Nubank
