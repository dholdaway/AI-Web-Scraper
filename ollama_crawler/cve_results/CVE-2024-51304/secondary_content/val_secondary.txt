 Inside Valspar Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Expense   Highlight
We currently estimate that upon their completion in fiscal year 2017, these actions will reduce annual costs by approximately $10,000, which is primarily due to lower employee-related costs and lower depreciation expense.



 Revenue - Product   Highlight
The decline was primarily due to lower sales in our consumer paints product line, the impact of foreign currency exchange and lower sales in our general industrial product line.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
Gross profit as a percent of sales increased to 36.6% from 35.3% in the prior year driven by improved productivity and favorable costprice comparison.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
The income approach is most sensitive to the discount rate, long-term sales growth rates and forecasted operating margins.

 Financial - Shares   Highlight
On November 21, 2014, the Board approved a new share repurchase program, with no expiration date, authorizing us to purchase up to $1,500,000 of outstanding shares of common stock.
