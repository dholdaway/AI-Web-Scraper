Ok, I just found there was an error in my code.
I put the working code in http://codepoet.info/pub/gcc/new_code/

The bug is still valid, as I don't think gcc must do a compiler internal error on that one :)

Well, fix your code...

It's what I did.

I think the bug is still important anyway. Gcc should not do an "internal compiler error" when it is asked to compile confusing/wrong code. Is'nt?
