Possible context of error(s):

[DEBUG] - (starship::config): Unable to read config file content: No such file or directory (os error 2)
[DEBUG] - (starship::utils): Error reading file: Err(Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "No such file or directory" })
error: test failed, to rerun pass '--lib'

Hi Agostino,

That particular test passes when I execute it. Is this reproducible?

Given this is in ::gentoo now and haven't been able to reproduce either (and 0.58.0 is gone), let's close this.

A new one will be opened if it comes back, can look again then.
