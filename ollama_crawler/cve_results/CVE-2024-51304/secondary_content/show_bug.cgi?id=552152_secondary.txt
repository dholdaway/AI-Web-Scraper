emerge: there are no ebuilds to satisfy "=dev-lang/perl-5.22*".
(dependency required by "virtual/perl-Carp-1.360.0::gentoo" [ebuild])
(dependency required by "dev-perl/DateManip-6.490.0::gentoo" [installed])
(dependency required by "app-portage/genlop-0.30.10-r1::gentoo" [installed])
(dependency required by "@selected" [set])
(dependency required by "@world" [argument])


Date-Manip:
RDEPEND="
        virtual/perl-Carp


virtual says
RDEPEND="
        || ( =dev-lang/perl-5.22* ~perl-core/${PN#perl-}-${PV} )

but there's no perl-core/Carp

and there's no perl 5.22

--> this cannot work, at all.

Ah. Leftover package.unmask bits from perl 5.18 interfering. Please ignore :)
