Description

There should be an enhancement in the network configuration scripts.

For WLAN there is already possible to have a automatic roaming in /etc/conf.d/net with entries config_<essid>=... like:
config_cafeX="dhcp"
config_Xzone=( "192.168.1.66 broadcast 192.168.1.255 netmask 255.255.255.0" )

It would be great, if something like that is also possible for fixed networks.
This can be done by usage of the tool 'arping'. For example try to reach the configured default routers (or other machines) to find the actual connected networks _before_ firing up the detected configuration.

Other distributions are using tools like "Guessnet", see
http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/07/03/1744235
but I think it makes more sense to integrate that functionality into the net config scripts directly.

Thanks
Frank

baselayout-1.12.x already has arping support.
