Why do you use things like

auth       sufficient	pam_rootok.so
auth       required		pam_permit.so
(eg. /etc/pam.d/useradd )

instead of

auth required pam_rootok.so

?

If there is a reason for this, please just give me some hint and excuse my waste of your lifetime.

Reproducible: Always

When you're root anyways, further checks are pointless.
