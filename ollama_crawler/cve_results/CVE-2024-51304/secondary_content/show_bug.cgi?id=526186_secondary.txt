Right now we're installing Sphinx docs through HTML_DOCS/dohtml. That includes implicit filtering that removes some of the Sphinx files. Since dohtml is being deprecated, HTML_DOCS are going to use dodoc, and we need some other filtering.

This brings the following questions:

1. which files do we want to install, and which ones we want to filter out?

2. do we want to install the docs somewhere more predictable (bug #522794)?

While it's safe to install 'the lot', it also makes for 'cruft'.  The other bug has brought the binary objects.inv to my attention. Otherwise on my part I don't know what else would be wise to include.  Surely Arfrever has some opinion on this.

I suppose HTML_DOCS works fine now and nobody has been complaining about extra files.
