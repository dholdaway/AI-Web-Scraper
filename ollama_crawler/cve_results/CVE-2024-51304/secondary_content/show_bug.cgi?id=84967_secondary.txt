Some operations (such as restarting a service) break when changing the IFS variable in the script.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create the following init script:
#!/sbin/runscript
start() {
        ebegin "start"
        IFS=""
        eend 0
}
stop() {
        ebegin "stop"
        IFS=""
        eend 0
}
2. Start the service
3. Restart the service

Actual Results:  
Syntax errors

Expected Results:  
Whenever a script (or a function, such as stop or start) finishes, runscript
should restore the variables, IFS among them.


This specific script can be repaird as follows:
#!/sbin/runscript

start() {
        ebegin "start"
        IFS=""
        IFS=$' \t\n'
        eend 0
}
stop() {
        ebegin "stop"
        IFS=""
        IFS=$' \t\n'
        eend 0
}

#eof

At the moment, I advice all programmers to store a backup of the important
variables and restore them at the end of the script.
In this workaround I've restored the default bash value for IFS, which runscript
expects.

Rather make all variable you change local, which should be the good bash practice:

-----
 $  (foo(){ local IFS="|"; echo "$*"; }; foo bar boo ban)
bar|boo|ban
