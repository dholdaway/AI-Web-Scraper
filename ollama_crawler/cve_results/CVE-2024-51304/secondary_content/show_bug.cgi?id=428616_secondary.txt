After emerge Netbeans-7.2 then user or root user cannot create template projects and the wizar project only show cancel button.

Perhaps is a font problem! as say in http://hanynowsky.wordpress.com/2012/04/27/netbeans-ide-look-feel-under-ubuntu-12-04/


I proble Solution 1 happie!!

>Go to your netbeans directory (ex: /home/user/netbeans7.2/etc) and open the file >: netbeans.conf


In Gentoo we have this file in that path

vi /etc/netbeans-7.2/netbeans.conf 


>then add the following line to netbeans options:
>-J-Dswing.aatext=true -J-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=lcd --laf Metal

It's ok is running ok!!!
