 Inside Chegg, Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements.



 Revenue - Product   Highlight
If our forecasts are inaccurate, the estimated amount of variable consideration could be inaccurate, which could impact our revenue recognition in a given period.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
In any particular period, the timing of additional hires could materially affect our operating expenses, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues.

 Other - Other   Highlight
If estimates or related assumptions change, this could have a significant impact on either the fair value of our reporting unit, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and evaluating our uncertain tax positions.
