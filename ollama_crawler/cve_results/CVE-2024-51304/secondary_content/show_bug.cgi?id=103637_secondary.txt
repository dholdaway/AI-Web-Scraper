Seems the tarballs have changed: 
 
!!! Digest verification Failed: 
!!!    /usr/portage/x11-libs/libXcursor/libXcursor-1.1.3-r1.ebuild 
!!! Reason: Filesize does not match recorded size 
 
!!! Digest verification Failed: 
!!!    /usr/portage/x11-libs/libXfixes/libXfixes-3.0.0.ebuild 
!!! Reason: Filesize does not match recorded size

were fine.

I'd double check your connection didn't hiccup or something funky.
