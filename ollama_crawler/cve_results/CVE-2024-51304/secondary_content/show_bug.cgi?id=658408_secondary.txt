patch set posted at https://marc.info/?l=openssh-unix-dev&r=1&b=201806&w=2, could be a good interim solution to bug 592578

if you have a specific patch you want merged independent of bug 592578, you should highlight it here.  otherwise, "merge the patchset to fix openssl 1.1 builds" is just a dupe of bug 592578.

this is "merge the patchset to fix [-ssl] builds". http://lists.mindrot.org/pipermail/openssh-unix-dev/2018-June/036977.html

although it's occurred to me that openssl is actually indirectly required by @system (via wget, probably all package-managers too), so *shrug* on that one. would be nice for openssl 1.1 though.

(In reply to Alex Xu (Hello71) from comment #3)

that doesn't matter to us in this case.  if the package needs openssl at build time, DEPEND should reflect it, or we should merge a patch to address it.

fortunately, unlike the openssl-1.1 work, i think that particular patch has a higher chance of being merged.

yes, I am assuming that they do actually want --without-openssl to work. seems like nobody actually reads the mailing list though. I'll give it another week then try tech@.

if it gets merged, or you don't hear back in a bit, ping us and we'll just move forward with fixing the build-time dep

couldn't be assed with resending the patch, and with

  >     adapt -portable to OpenSSL 1.1x API                                                                                                                                                                                                    
  >                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
  >     Polyfill missing API with replacement functions extracted from LibreSSL                                                                                                                                                                

I probably won't bother.
