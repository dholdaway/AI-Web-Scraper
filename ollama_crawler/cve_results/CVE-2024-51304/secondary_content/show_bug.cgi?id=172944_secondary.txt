This is probably not a real bug, but I still found it to be very weird and don't know where else I should mention this:
When I emerge wxGTK it downloads and installs the wxPython tarball.

On the wxWidgets website they provide a wxGTK tarball (which I would expect to be grabbed when emerging wxGTK), so I can't see the need for downloading something different.
Additionally there is a wxPython ebuild in the Portage tree, which depends on wxGTK, so this is apparently not meant to be a all-in-one ebuild, either.
I can't find a single note why one should use wxPython instead of wxGTK.

Hopefully someone can enlighten me and if necessary provide a comment on the SRC_URI in the wxGTK ebuild.

Reproducible: Always

wxPython tarballs are wxGTK + patches added to CVS since last wxGTK release + wxPython in it's own directory.  This keeps us from having to carry the patches ourselves until wxGTK makes a new release, keeps the wxGTK and wxPython versions exactly in sync, and saves you 10MB of distfiles space. ;D

Good idea.  I had to ask someone too.

Ok, as an update: please do NOT use the ebuild I provided. Clearly it does not work. I thought I had tested it, but rather had tested wxPython-2.6, having forgotten to unmask 2.8. Woops!

I'm working on it, but I keep getting this error, and I don't know why:

!!! set-wxconfig: Error:  Can't find normal or debug version:
!!! set-wxconfig:         /usr/bin/wxgtk2u-2.4-config not found
!!! set-wxconfig:         /usr/bin/wxgtk2ud-2.4-config not found
!!! You need to emerge wxGTK with unicode in your USE

The error makes sense, the ebuild is asking for an old version of wxGTK, but I don't know where the ebuild is doing that asking.

(In reply to comment #2)
Disregard that, I was referring to bug #178727 - can you tell it's been a long night?
