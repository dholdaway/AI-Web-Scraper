Description


Wilson M. Michaels





          2012-10-26 16:59:14 UTC
        

The ebuild install should check/fix the file "/etc/conf.d/apache2" to include "-D PHP5" in the APACHE2_OPTS= string. This loads the PHP module.  The default apache install does not load PHP.  Owncloud requires PHP to operate so the ebuild should insure that the module is loaded into apache.

This bug results in a web page that does not at first seem to be related to the real problem. [see "Actual Results" in this report]

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install owncloud on a system that has never had apache installed on it.
2. /etc/init.d/apache2 start
3. In browser go to "http://localhost/owncloud/
4. Get error page shown in this bug's description.
Actual Results:  
Forbidden

You don't have permission to access /owncloud/ on this server.

Additionally, a 404 Not Found error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.
Apache Server at localhost Port 80

Expected Results:  
OwnCloud setup page loads.

www-apps/owncloud-4.5.0
www-servers/apache-2.2.23

No ebuilds in the tree (webapp.eclass users) seem to automagically enable www-servers/apache features the way you propose. Generally, if you want that kind of functionality, you should probably use Debian, not Gentoo.
