I tried building IGC against opencl-clang:10 on Friday before the version bump, and again a moment ago having seen this bug report. On both occasions it has built fine.

What do you get if you manually run 'readelf -d /usr/lib/llvm/10/lib64/libopencl-clang.so'?

Dunno why but it compiles fine now on the same machine
