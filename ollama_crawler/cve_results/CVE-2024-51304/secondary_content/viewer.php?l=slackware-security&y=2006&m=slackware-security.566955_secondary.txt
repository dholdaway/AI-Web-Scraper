[slackware-security]  bind (SSA:2006-310-01)

New bind packages are available for Slackware 8.1, 9.0, 9.1, 10.0, 10.1, 10.2,
and 11.0 to fix security issues.  The minimum OpenSSL version was raised to
OpenSSL 0.9.7l and OpenSSL 0.9.8d to avoid exposure to known security flaws
in older versions (these patches were already issued for Slackware).  If you
have not upgraded yet, get those as well to prevent a potentially exploitable
security problem in named.

In addition, the default RSA exponent was changed from 3 to 65537.

Both of these issues are essentially the same as ones discovered in OpenSSL at
the end of September 2006, only now there's protection against compiling using
the wrong OpenSSL version.  RSA keys using exponent 3 (which was previously
BIND's default) will need to be regenerated to protect against the forging of
RRSIGs.

More details about this issue may be found in the Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database:

  http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4339


Here are the details from the Slackware 11.0 ChangeLog:
+--------------------------+
patches/packages/bind-9.3.2_P2-i486-1_slack11.0.tgz:
  Upgraded to bind-9.3.2-P2.  This fixes some security issues related to
  previous fixes in OpenSSL.  The minimum OpenSSL version was raised to
  OpenSSL 0.9.7l and OpenSSL 0.9.8d to avoid exposure to known security flaws
  in older versions (these patches were already issued for Slackware).  If you
  have not upgraded yet, get those as well to prevent a potentially exploitable
  security problem in named.  In addition, the default RSA exponent was changed
  from 3 to 65537.  RSA keys using exponent 3 (which was previously BIND's
  default) will need to be regenerated to protect against the forging
  of RRSIGs.

Where to find the new packages:
+-----------------------------+

HINT:  Getting slow download speeds from ftp.slackware.com?
Give slackware.osuosl.org a try.  This is another primary FTP site
for Slackware that can be considerably faster than downloading
from ftp.slackware.com.

Thanks to the friendly folks at the OSU Open Source Lab
(http://osuosl.org) for donating additional FTP and rsync hosting
to the Slackware project!  :-)

Also see the "Get Slack" section on http://slackware.com for
additional mirror sites near you.
