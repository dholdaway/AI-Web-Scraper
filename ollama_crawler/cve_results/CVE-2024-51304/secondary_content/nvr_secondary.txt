 Inside Nvr Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Income   Highlight
Changes in management’s judgment of the expected term and the expected volatility could have a material effect on the grant-date fair value calculated and expensed within the income statement.



 Other - Other   Highlight
In addition, NVRM’s operating results may be adversely affected in future periods due to tightening and volatility of the credit markets, changes in investor funding times, increased regulation of mortgage lending practices and increased competition in the mortgage market.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Because we sell all of our loans (a small subset of such loans are serviced for a short period of time prior to sale), there is often a substantial delay between the time that a loan goes into default and the time that the investor requests us to reimburse them for losses incurred because of the default.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Segment revenues decreased due primarily to an 11% decrease in the number of units settled and a 1% decrease in the average settlement price.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
The decrease in segment profit was driven by a decrease in segment revenues of approximately $423,700, or 20%, coupled with a decrease in gross profit margins.
