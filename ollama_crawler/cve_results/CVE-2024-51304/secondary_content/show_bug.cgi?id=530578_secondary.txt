Description


Gaetan





          2014-11-25 10:48:00 UTC
        

Upgrade (and possibly installation) of htop-1.0.3 is crashing because of missing dependency (configure: error: Package requirements (ncursesw) were not met).

Manual upgrade of sys-libs/ncurses to 5.9-r3 fixes the issue.

This should be integrated as a requirement of htop ebuild.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge =sys-process/htop-1.0.3
Actual Results:  
configure: error: Package requirements (ncursesw) were not met:

No package 'ncursesw' found

Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
installed software in a non-standard prefix.

Expected Results:  
Installation OK

*ncurses-5.9-r1 (21 Nov 2011)

  21 Nov 2011; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> +ncurses-5.9-r1.ebuild:
  Install pkg-config files.

Additionally, we've had a version of ncurses that installs pkg-config files stable since mid 2012.
