Description

          2006-09-15 12:29:06 UTC
        

[ebuild   R   ] x11-libs/gtk+-2.8.20-r1  USE="X jpeg -debug -doc -tiff -xinerama" 0 kB
[ebuild   R   ] gnome-base/libglade-2.5.1  USE="-debug -doc" 0 kB
[ebuild   R   ] media-video/ogmrip-0.10.0_rc3  USE="aac hal matroska spell -debug -gtk -srt -theora" 0 kB

I previously got the OGMRip GUI to build by re-emerging libglade. However, after doing a world update, the GUI no longer builds, even if I once again re-emerge libglade. I am using the ebuild provided in bug #146457.

Reopen with some errors and emerge --info.

Because it doesn't build the GUI at all there is no error, except ./configure indicates that it will not be building the GUI. To my knowledge none of my useflags have changed since I last installed ogmrip.

Cough, how about compiling it w/ USE=gtk?
