media-plugins/gst-plugins-soup-0.10.14 fails to run its tests:

make  check-TESTS
make[3]: Entering directory `/var/tmp/portage/media-plugins/gst-plugins-soup-0.10.14/work/gst-plugins-good-0.10.14/tests/check'
GConf Error: Failed to contact configuration server; some possible causes are that you need to enable TCP/IP networking for ORBit, or you have stale NFS locks due to a system crash. See http://projects.gnome.org/gconf/ for information. (Details -  1: Failed to get connection to session: Did not receive a reply. Possible causes include: the remote application did not send a reply, the message bus security policy blocked the reply, the reply timeout expired, or the network connection was broken.)

The same failure happens with media-plugins/gst-plugins-good-0.10.14.

Tests will not work with separate plugins..

Ok, I added RESTRICT=test to the gst-plugins-* eclasses ...

It seems to block while esdsink is starting up, so its trying to open esd, but it fails since esd is not running as that user. That causes two one-second delays and that makes the test timeout.. What is strange here is that the tests are not supposed to test installed elements, only the newly-compiled ones (and esd is in a different ebuild)...

I had similar delays later on when using Gnome software (most notable evolution), so it could be that my system-wide esound was fubar.

Indeed, the tests pass without issue now.
