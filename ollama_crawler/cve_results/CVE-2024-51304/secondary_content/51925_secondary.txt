association isn't a public method so I don't think we should mention it.
Maybe:

 # Returns the Association object,

It's documented here:



rails/activerecord/lib/active_record/associations.rb


        Lines 719 to 732
      in
      f6918a5






 # Some extensions can only be made to work with knowledge of the association's internals. 



 # Extensions can access relevant state using the following methods (where +items+ is the 



 # name of the association): 



 # 



 # * <tt>record.association(:items).owner</tt> - Returns the object the association is part of. 



 # * <tt>record.association(:items).reflection</tt> - Returns the reflection object that describes the association. 



 # * <tt>record.association(:items).target</tt> - Returns the associated object for #belongs_to and #has_one, or 



 #   the collection of associated objects for #has_many and #has_and_belongs_to_many. 



 # 



 # However, inside the actual extension code, you will not have access to the <tt>record</tt> as 



 # above. In this case, you can access <tt>proxy_association</tt>. For example, 



 # <tt>record.association(:items)</tt> and <tt>record.items.proxy_association</tt> will return 



 # the same object, allowing you to make calls like <tt>proxy_association.owner</tt> inside 



 # association extensions. 





I linked to this section from the method docs, but that is a good point.

Returns the Association object,

Association doesn't exist and Associations is also private. 🤔

I've also removed proxy_association from the guides. We should probably restore that as well?

I'll merge this because it is ready, but we should make association and the methods we document extension should use public in another PR.

@rafaelfranca Should #target also be documented or should it be :nodoc:?

That was my assumption based on #51925 (comment).

We should make association public as well along with owner, reflection and target on that object

@p8 Do you want to open the PR?
