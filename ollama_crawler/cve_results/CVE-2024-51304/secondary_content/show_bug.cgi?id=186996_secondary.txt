Description

media-video/dvdstyler-1.5-r1 depends on =x11-libs/wxGTK-2.6* while it probably should on >=x11-libs/wxGTK-2.6.3, because that's what configure checks for.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have <wxGTK-2.6.3 installed
2. emerge =dvdstyler-1.5-r1

Actual Results:  
checking for wxWindows version >= 2.6.3... no (version 2.6.2 is not new enough)
configure: error:
        Please check that wx-config is in path, the directory
        where wxWidgets libraries are installed (returned by
        'wx-config --libs' command) is in LD_LIBRARY_PATH or
        equivalent variable and wxWidgets is version 2.6.3 or above.

Expected Results:  
wxGTK should be automagically upgraded from the older version by a proper dependency.

Manually upgrading wxGTK to 2.6.3.3 makes it all work.

Upgrade your system properly using --deep. >=x11-libs/wxGTK-2.6.3 will completely break for people w/ wxGTK-2.8 installed.
