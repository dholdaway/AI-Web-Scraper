(NYSE: IFF) reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.Fourth Quarter 2023 Consolidated Summary:Reported (GAAP)Adjusted (Non-GAAP)1SalesLoss Before TaxesEPSOperating EBITDAOperating EBITDA MarginEPS ex Amortization$2.7 B$(2.6) B$(10.21)$461 M17.1%$0.72Full Year 2023 Consolidated Summary:Reported (GAAP)Adjusted (Non-GAAP)1SalesLoss Before TaxesEPSOperating EBITDAOperating EBITDA MarginEPS ex Amortization$11.5 B$(2.5) B$(10.05)$2.0 B17.2%$3.34Management Commentary"I am thrilled to join IFF at such an important and dynamic time for the company and our industry," said IFF CEO Erik Fyrwald. "In the fourth quarter, IFF delivered solid results, including a sequential improvement in volume and double-digit adjusted operating EBITDA growth on a comparable currency neutral basis. In line with our commitment to strengthen our capital structure, we have updated our dividend policy to enable faster deleveraging and provide improved financial flexibility.  As we look ahead, we recognize that the operating environment remains uncertain, yet we are cautiously optimistic that we can deliver improved financial results for our shareholders in 2024."Fourth Quarter 2023 Consolidated Financial Results•Reported net sales for the fourth quarter were $2.70 billion, a decrease of 5% compared to the prior year period. On a comparable basis2, currency neutral sales1 increased 1% versus the prior year period, led by growth in Scent and Health & Biosciences. Volume performance continued to improve sequentially across nearly all businesses and pricing remained solid.•Loss before taxes on a reported basis for the fourth quarter was $2.64 billion, largely driven by a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $2.6 billion. Adjusted operating EBITDA1 for the fourth quarter was $461 million. On a comparable basis2, currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA1 increased 17% led by favorable net pricing and productivity gains.1 Schedules at the end of this release contain reconciliations of reported GAAP to Non-GAAP metrics. See Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures for explanations of our Non-GAAP metrics.2 Comparable results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 exclude the impact of divestitures and acquisitions.1The following information was filed by International Flavors Fragrances Inc (IFF) on Tuesday, February 20, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.
