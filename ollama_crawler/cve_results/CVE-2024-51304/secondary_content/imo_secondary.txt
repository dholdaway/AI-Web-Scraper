Excluding the impacts of working capital1, cash flow from operating activities was $1,799 million, compared to $1,946 million in the third quarter.

Excluding the impacts of working capital1, full-year cash flow from operating activities was $6,435 million.“Our strong 2023 financial results were underpinned by solid operational performance across all of our businesses, highlighted by record production and substantial unit cost reductions at Kearl,” said Brad Corson, chairman, president and chief executive officer. “Throughout the year, we also made significant progress on strategic investments that will help lower emissions and capture value for our shareholders, including the Grand Rapids expansion at Cold Lake and the renewable diesel facility at our Strathcona refinery.”Upstream production in the fourth quarter averaged 452,000 gross oil-equivalent barrels per day, the highest quarterly production in over 30 years when adjusting for the divestment of XTO Energy Canada, with full-year production of 413,000 gross oil-equivalent barrels per day. At Kearl, quarterly total gross production averaged 308,000 barrels per day (218,000 barrels Imperial's share), the highest quarterly production in the asset’s history. Kearl also delivered record full-year production of 270,000 total gross barrels per day (191,000 barrels Imperial's share).1 non-GAAP financial measure - see Attachment VI for definition and reconciliationAfter more than a century, Imperial continues to be an industry leader in applying technology and innovation to responsibly develop Canada’s energy resources.
