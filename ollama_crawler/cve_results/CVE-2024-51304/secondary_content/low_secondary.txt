Excluding the transaction costs in the prior year, fourth quarter 2022 adjusted diluted EPS1 was $2.28.Total sales for the quarter were $18.6 billion,2 compared to $22.4 billion in the prior year quarter. Prior-year quarterly sales included approximately $1.4 billion from the additional 53rd week, as well as $958 million generated from our Canadian retail business. Comparable sales3 for the quarter decreased 6.2% due to a slowdown in DIY demand and unfavorable January winter weather, while Pro customer comparable sales were flat for the quarter. “This quarter we delivered strong operating profit and improved customer satisfaction, despite the continued pullback in DIY spending,” commented Marvin R. Ellison, Lowe's chairman, president and CEO. “We remain confident in the long-term strength of the home improvement market, and we are making the right investments in our Total Home strategy to take share. We are also pleased to award $140 million in discretionary bonuses to our frontline associates in recognition of their exceptional customer service in 2023.”As of Feb. 2, 2024, Lowe's operated 1,746 stores representing 194.9 million square feet of retail selling space.Capital AllocationThe company remains committed to a best-in-class capital allocation strategy focused on driving long-term, sustainable shareholder value.

In total, the company returned $8.9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in fiscal 2023.1 Adjusted diluted earnings per share is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation” section of this release for additional information, as well as reconciliations between the Company’s GAAP and non-GAAP financial results.2 Total fourth quarter sales includes an approximately $200 million headwind related to a timing shift in our fiscal calendar as we cycle over a 53-week year.3 Comparable sales are based on comparison to weeks 41-53 in 2022.The following information was filed by Lowes Companies Inc (LOW) on Tuesday, February 27, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.

 Inside Lowes Companies Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory.



 Other - Other   Highlight
However, changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves.

 Other - Other   Highlight
In the event that our estimates vary from actual results, we may record additional impairment losses, which could be material to our results of operations.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
The availability and the borrowing costs of these funds could be adversely affected, however, by a downgrade of our debt ratings or a deterioration of certain financial ratios.

 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
If the actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments we have made in determining whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its useful life or in estimating future cash flows and determining asset fair values, our actual impairment losses could vary from our estimated impairment losses.
