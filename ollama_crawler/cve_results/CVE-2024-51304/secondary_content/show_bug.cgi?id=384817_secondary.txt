Description

The ebuild net-dns/pdns/pdns-3.0.ebuild has an error on the econf part.
It needs --with-mysql-include=/usr/include which is absent causing compile failure.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge pdns
2. Compilation fails
3. Run EXTRA_ECONF="--with-mysql-include=/usr/include" emerge pdns
4. Package installed.

Please add build.log

Build log

There you go, I've attached the build log. As you can see, --with-mysql-include isn't passed to ./configure and the build fails.

With EXTRA_ECONF="--with-mysql-include=/usr/include" it successfully compiles, because I installed the package on my server by setting EXTRA_ECONF before the command runs.

There's a slight error, it's EXTRA_ECONF="--with-mysql-includes=/usr/include" instead of `include'. Just stumbled around it while updating on another Gentoo amd64.

Compile fine here, without the option.
