Description

Various packages depending on altas ignore sci-libs/atlas-3.10.1 still try to pull deprecated linalg packages which block atlas-3.10.1

diana ~ # eix sci-libs/atlas
[I] sci-libs/atlas [1]
     Available versions:  (~)3.10.1 {{doc fortran generic lapack static-libs threads}}
     Installed versions:  3.10.1(05:21:14 PM 02/13/2013)(fortran lapack threads -doc -generic -static-libs)
     Homepage:            http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/
     Description:         Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software

[1] "science" /var/lib/layman/science


diana ~ # emerge -av octave

These are the packages that would be merged, in order:

Calculating dependencies... done!
[ebuild  N     ] sci-mathematics/octave-3.4.3-r1  USE="X fftw glpk imagemagick opengl openmp qhull qrupdate readline sparse zlib -curl -doc -static-libs" 0 kB
[ebuild  N     ] app-admin/eselect-lapack-0.1  0 kB
[ebuild  N     ] sci-libs/lapack-reference-3.1.1-r1  USE="-doc" 8 kB
[blocks B      ] app-admin/eselect-lapack ("app-admin/eselect-lapack" is blocking sci-libs/atlas-3.10.1)

Normally octave should install without pulling these, I guess.

simply uninstall app-admin/eselect-lapack. There is no complete upgrade path from the tree to the overlay. But we are working to make it smooth the other way round.
