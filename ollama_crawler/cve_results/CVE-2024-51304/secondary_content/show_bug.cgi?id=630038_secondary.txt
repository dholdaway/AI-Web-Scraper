Description

As of:

https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/?id=eadebaeb8cb8b181c96add76b74bc84a83e7543b

IUSE +egl has been removed from dev-qt/qtwayland and now unconditional. This removal makes it impossible to build kde-frameworks/kwayland. Fix is to remove the 'egl(+)' requirement from the RDEPEND.

The '(+)' means "assume the USE flag is enabled if it is not present".

Have you encountered a problem of some kind?

(and comment #1)

I'm not able to reproduce this by building from source - I think the issue concerns dependencies between binpkgs (I'm building on / using a binhost). So I think this is out of context. Sorry about that!

Yep, in-place dependency changes aren't picked up by binpkgs.
