Description

Hi all,

I guess someone already thought about this - but I couldn't find a report regarding this one, so here's my little rant anyway.

Packages often depend on mozilla-firefox when the "nsplugin" USE flag is set. For instance vlc and totem. But mozilla-firefox is a pretty big package to compile -- I for one rather use the mozilla-firefox-bin package.

So here's my request/question: Would it be possible to have a mozilla-firefox-headers ebuild that vlc, totem and all the others can depend on (in case the "nsplugin" USE flag is set)?

You'd end up having mozilla-firefox-bin and mozilla-firefox-headers on your box -- wouldn't that be enough to be able to compile the netscape plugins in applications like vlc and totem?

If this would work the FF-bin users wouldn't be forced to compile FF is all I'm saying. I hope someone will shed some light.

Thanks!

Regards
Sebastian

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Emerge vlc with "nsplugin" in your USE flags
2. mozilla-firefox gets pulled in as a dependency, although you may only want to have the FF-bin version

Actual Results:  
mozilla-firefox gets compiled.

Expected Results:  
Portage offers a headers package of firefox that supplies all the necessities to build the netscape plugin extensions of other software, for instance vlc and totem.

USE=xulrunner will fix that for you ;)

Are you sure? There's both xulrunner and xulrunner-bin. xulrunner is ~ 30 MB so compiling that would take approximately the same amount of time as firefox. And the -bin version of xulrunner isn't mentioned as an alternative dependency in both vlc and totem.

Dropping this request directly on the mozilla team, for obvious reasons.

Well, actually assigning to the mozilla team. Thanks for poking me Sebastian.

xulrunner-bin is what you may want. Have you tried if those packages build against it? If so, open different bugs for them.
