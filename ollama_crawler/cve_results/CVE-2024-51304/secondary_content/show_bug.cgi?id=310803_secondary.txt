After some time (reading etc. on a site) clicking a link crashes ALL tabs belonging to domane. For example i read something on example.com/read1, then i click a link to example.com/read2 (havent checked if it crashes also when clickin a link outside the domain but i think it also crashes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install version 4.0.356
2.Stay some time on a website (don't know how long exactly)
3.Click a link pointing to another website

Actual Results:  
All the tabs belonging to the domain crash

Looks like it crashes even if i click in the background of the website. There is some timeout when it starts to trigger.

Please modify the summary to include what application you are talking about. Also post your emerge --info please.

Just to confirm - was it working fine for you in the previous versions of the browser?

Does it look like http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=38414 ?

The 4.0.342.5 version was working just fine. When i compiled the 4.0.356 version i noticed that bug, i switched back to 4.0.342.5 and didn't have that bug anymore. It's not that bug (code.google[...])

Are you able to obtain a backtrace? See http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/LinuxDebugging for some tips.

I installed gdb but it looks to me like this happens only on one site vigilantcitizen.com, i can't reproduce it on other websites. While it is dead easy to reproduce it on the above website clicking in the background/link does the trick of crashing all tabs. Change status of this bug to resolved?

If it's crashing it's clearly not resolved. I'll take a closer look later. Could you try to obtain a backtrace with gdb? Please note that you need to debug the renderer instead of the browser process. See http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/LinuxDebugging for more details.

I can't debug it, first there are no debugging symbols (understandable?) and second if i start chromium (or even directly the /usr/lib/chromium-browser/chrome ) with any proposed commands from google's website then i just can't browse anything, it becomes unresponsive no matter what website i try to go to and asks me to kill the unresponsive window.

I can't reproduce the crash with 5.0.366.2. I wonder if the CFLAGS you use could be a part of the problem.

Yeah, it was an upstream fault of the 5.0.356 version, 5.0.360.5 resolved it.
