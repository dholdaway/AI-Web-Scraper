Is some other service already running on that port? Use netstat to find out and
post the information here.

I have run all sorts of tests on that port, and nothing seems to report anything
already running on that port.

Tried netstat, nmap, ngrep (when trying to start mythbackend)

EVERYTHING seems to point out that nothing is running on that port.

I also tried a reboot, which still didn't solve the problem.

I had a good chat with the guys on irc on the mythtv channel, and they're out of
ideas.  So i thought post here as a last resort.

Hmmm... :/ 

BTW, you forgot to reopen.

only thing I can suggest is that you put the wrong hostname when you configured it. you should have left it as localhost. The other idea is that localhost isn't defined in /etc/hosts.

I've seen this again before... turns out another process had used the port. Try changing ports still.
