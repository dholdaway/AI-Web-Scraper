Description

Despite settings in /etc/conf.d/net, on boot the NIS domain name is set to the DNS domain.  Example:

# /etc/conf.d/net
iface_eth0="dhcp"
dhcpcd_eth0="-DYN"
dns_domain="example.com"
dns_server="192.168.0.1"
nis_domain_eth0="foo"
nis_servers_eth0="192.168.0.1"

And yet, following a boot:
# domainname -y
example.com

NB: the dns_domain and dns_server lines have no effect either way; they're useful for illustration


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set the NIS domain in /etc/conf.d/net to something other than the DNS domain
2. Start networking
3. Observe NIS domain, e.g. "domainname -y"

Actual Results:  
DNS domain name

Expected Results:  
NIS domain name

baselayout-1.12.9
dhcpcd-2.0.5-r1

dhcpcd-3.0.16 is being marked stable on arches now - does this still happen with you use that version?

If so, reopen. Thanks
