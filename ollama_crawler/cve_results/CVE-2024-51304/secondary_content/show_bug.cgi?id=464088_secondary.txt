That is really weird, NepomukCore_FOUND is used to report its availability:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The following OPTIONAL packages could NOT be located on your system.
-- Consider installing them to enable more features from this software.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   * Nepomuk  <nepomuk-core>
     Nepomuk Core Library
     Required to build Nepomuk features.

but is also used to control building of the runner causing the error:

if(NepomukCore_FOUND)
  add_subdirectory(nepomuksearch)
endif(NepomukCore_FOUND)


Could you please attach /var/tmp/portage/kde-base/plasma-workspace-4.10.1-r1/work/plasma-workspace-4.10.1_build/CMakeCache.txt ?

Using eix, I found a number of "stuck" KDE items.  I couldn't get past plasma-workplace, so I un-emerged:

kde-base/plasma-workspace kde-base/nepomuk-core kde-base/nepomuk kde-base/kdeplasma-addons kde-base/kdebase-startkde kde-base/kdebase-meta

Then, I re-emerged kde-base/kdebase-meta. This resulted in three packages being merged:

kde-base/plasma-workspace-4.10.1-r1
kde-base/kdebase-startkde-4.10.1
kde-base/kdebase-startkde-4.10.1

Nothing left to update, so we should probably just close this bug at this point.

Thanks.
