Sometimes (quite often for me, actually), byobu-5.27 (tmux version) does not create a new window on F2-keypress. I get an error message: "create window failed: /bin/bash no such file or directory". Perhaps a path problem?

I most often see this when starting byobu, doing an eix-sync and during that trying to create a new window. When I create a new window first, I can create new windows also after starting eix-sync.

How do I diagnose this further?

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start byobu
2. run eix-sync
3. press F2
Actual Results:  
error message "create window failed: /bin/bash no such file or directory"

Expected Results:  
new window created

IS this still present in latest byobu?

I have not bumped into this issue again recently. So I'm fine with closing this bug as "resolved obsolete". If it resurfaces again, I can always revive the bug.
