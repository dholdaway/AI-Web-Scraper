Announces Preliminary Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year ResultsSan Mateo, CA, October 31, 2023 – Franklin Resources, Inc. (the “Company”) [NYSE: BEN] today announced preliminary net income1 of $295.5 million or $0.58 per diluted share for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $227.5 million or $0.44 per diluted share for the previous quarter, and $232.7 million or $0.46 per diluted share for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. Preliminary net income1 for the year ended September 30, 2023 was $882.8 million or $1.72 per diluted share, as compared to $1,291.9 million or $2.53 per diluted share for the prior year. Preliminary operating income was $338.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $314.9 million for the previous quarter and $348.5 million for the prior year.As supplemental information, the Company is providing certain adjusted performance measures which are based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles. Preliminary adjusted net income2 was $427.0 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share2 was $0.84 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $326.1 million and $0.63 for the previous quarter, and $394.4 million and $0.78 for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. Preliminary adjusted net income2 was $1,332.2 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share2 was $2.60 for the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $1,855.6 million and $3.63 for the prior year. Preliminary adjusted operating income2 was $511.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $476.8 million for the previous quarter and $494.1 million for the prior year.“As we look back over our fiscal year, challenging global financial markets and geopolitical uncertainty weighed on investor sentiment,” said Jenny Johnson, President and CEO of Franklin Resources, Inc. “Against this backdrop and amidst ongoing industry-wide change, we continued to make progress executing on our long-term plan focused on further diversifying our business across asset classes, vehicles, and geographies. “For the fiscal year, long-term net flows were positive in key areas, including alternatives, multi-asset, ETFs, Canvas®, and the high-net-worth channel. While long-term inflows were impacted by the risk-off environment, long-term outflows improved by over 20% from the prior year. Our largest alternative managers, Benefit Street Partners, Clarion Partners, and Lexington Partners, generated $11 billion in net flows for the year. Fixed income net outflows improved from the prior year, and starting in the second quarter, we saw investor interest accelerate. In addition, the successful execution of our regionally focused distribution strategy resulted in positive net flows for the fourth quarter for our non-US regions and a significant improvement in long-term net outflows for the fiscal year. Our Asia-Pacific region generated positive long-term net flows for the fiscal year, and our EMEA region turned positive in the second half of fiscal 2023. “One of our strategic priorities has been to increase our scale in key segments of the industry reflecting long-term client demand. In this pursuit to offer more choice to more clients, we closed the acquisition of Alcentra, a leading European credit manager, doubling our alternative credit assets under management (“AUM’). Firmwide alternative AUM increased by over 13% to $255 billion from the prior year, making Franklin Templeton one of the largest managers of alternative assets. Furthermore, we were pleased to announce the pending acquisition of Putnam Investments with $136 billion of AUM and our relationship with Power Corporation and Great-West Lifeco, strengthening our presence in the retirement and insurance segments. The transaction will enable us to further increase our investment in these key sectors to better serve all our clients and remains on track to close in the fourth quarter of calendar 2023. 1The following information was filed by Franklin Resources Inc (BEN) on Tuesday, October 31, 2023 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.

 Inside Franklin Resources Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Income   Highlight
SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES As supplemental information, we are providing performance measures for "adjusted operating income," "adjusted operating margin," "adjusted net income" and "adjusted diluted earnings per share," each of which is based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP measures").



 Financial - Income   Highlight
"Adjusted operating income," "adjusted operating margin," "adjusted net income" and "adjusted diluted earnings per share" are defined below, followed by reconciliations of operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc. and diluted earnings per share on a U.S. GAAP basis to these non-GAAP measures.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Interest expense increased $25.5 million in fiscal year 2023 primarily due to a full year of accretion on Lexington deferred consideration, higher interest on debt and an increase in interest recognized on tax reserves.

 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
The fair values of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible assets are based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows, which include significant assumptions about the AUM growth rate, pre-tax profit margin, discount rate, average effective fee rate and effective tax rate.

 M & A - Other   Highlight
Our total AUM was $1,374.2 billion at September 30, 2023, which was 6% higher than at September 30, 2022 driven by the positive impact of $58.9 billion of net market change, distributions and other, $34.9 billion from an acquisition, and $4.3 billion of cash management net inflows, partially offset by $21.3 billion of long-term net outflows.
