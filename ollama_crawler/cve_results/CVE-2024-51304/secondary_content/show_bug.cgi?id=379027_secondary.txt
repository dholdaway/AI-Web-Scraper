My spamassassin creates the folder /.spamassassin and I think this is a config problem but I cant figure out why. You can remove the folder but after a while it will appear again..I am attaching my config files. I use razor, pyzor etc. with spamassassin. Current version is mail-filter/spamassassin-3.3.1-r4 but it happened with previous versions as well.

Reproducible: Always

I think after updating to openrc, this no longer occurs. so closing.
