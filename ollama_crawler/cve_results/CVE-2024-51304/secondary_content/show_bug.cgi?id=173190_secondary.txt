Before you unmerge prelink you should remove prelinking from binaries or Portage will fail md5 checks and not remove the files. This message should go to the prelink pkg_postrm and the guide.

Something like `prelink -au` should do the trick.  Also, then need to make sure that /etc/cron.daily/prelink doesn't run during or after the run `prelink -au`, so they should remove the cronjob first.

Fixed in CVS, thanks for reporting & the comments.

i dont fancy putting stuff into pkg_postrm since there's no trivial way of detecting whether you're doing an unmerge or an upgrade ... the function is called in both cases and we wouldnt want the message shown in the latter ...

Oops, reopening for the portage/toolchain team to deal with their part of it.

Since portage-2.1.3 this isn't much of an issue anymore because bug #134620 is solved via FEATURES="unmerge-orphans" which is enabled by default.
