Hi,
this is a special case of bug 44796. FEATURES=splitdebug is different from other options (such as buildpkg) in that setting it from /etc/portage/env __worked__ in some 2.2_rc versions (about 2.2_rc67 I guess) but it stopped working witch recent 2.2.0_alpha versions.

You need to use the new /etc/portage/package.env file. For example, put your FEATURES=splitdebug and related settings if /etc/portage/env/debug.conf, and something like this in /etc/portage/package.env:

  sys-libs/glibc debug.conf

Oh, I see, thanks.

man portage still mentions both variants, maybe it could prefer the new method (and mention drawbacks of the old method).
