What version of nvidia-kernel are you trying to emerge?
Can you post the output of "emerge info"?

I was trying to emerge the lastest nvidia kernel for x86 not sure wich version
it is. I cant paste emerge -info since I gave up from that install since X
wouldnt work in the box. But as ive pointed nvidia has a report about it as a
sticky in their official forum.
