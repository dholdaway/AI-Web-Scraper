Description


Holger Hoffstätte

After updating to dbus-1.15.2 I found that its socket is placed in /tmp, unlike before with 1.15.0 where it lives in /run/dbus. This can lead to dbus (and system) outages when e.g. a tmpcleaner sees a 0-sized file in /tmp and deletes it.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. update to dbus-1.15.2
2. find socket in /tmp
3. delete socket: dbus dead


Expected Results:  
The socket should live in /run/dbus as before.


Probably a change in runstatedir configuration.

This might also affect the recently added 1.14.4 but I haven't checked.

Yeah, it's:

• On Linux, dbus-daemon and other uses of DBusServer now create a
  path-based Unix socket, unix:path=..., when asked to listen on a
  unix:tmpdir=... address. This makes unix:tmpdir=... equivalent to
  unix:dir=... on all platforms.
  Previous versions would have created an abstract socket, unix:abstract=...,
  in this situation.
  This change primarily affects the well-known session bus when run via
  dbus-launch(1) or dbus-run-session(1). The user bus, enabled by configuring
  dbus with --enable-user-session and running it on a systemd system,
  already used path-based Unix sockets and is unaffected by this change.
  This behaviour change prevents a sandbox escape via the session bus socket
  in sandboxing frameworks that can share the network namespace with the host
  system, such as Flatpak.
  This change might cause a regression in situations where the abstract socket
  is intentionally shared between the host system and a chroot or container,
  such as some use-cases of schroot(1). That regression can be resolved by
  using a bind-mount to share either the D-Bus socket, or the whole /tmp
  directory, with the chroot or container.
  (dbus#416, Simon McVittie)

I guess.

The system bus continues to live at /run/dbus/system_bus_socket.

Session buses never created sockets in /run/dbus. Per the notes in comment 2, they used to be "abstract", meaning they had no presence in the filesystem at all. Now they live in /tmp instead.

This is an intentional change by dbus upstream. You will need to fix whatever cleanup scripts you use to not remove the sockets from /tmp.
