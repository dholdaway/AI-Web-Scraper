Since Sir Terry Pratchett's passing there has been a campaign to add "GNU Terry Pratchett" to HTTP headers http://www.gnuterrypratchett.com/

I wanted to see if there was any interest to add this option via a use flag - similar to how there is/was flags to allow comical or rude messages from certain programs

Here's some background

"You know they'll never really die while the Trunk is alive[...]
It lives while the code is shifted, and they live with it, always Going Home."
- Moist von Lipwig, Going Postal, Chapter 13

In Terry Pratchett's Discworld series, the clacks are a series of semaphore towers loosely based on the concept of the telegraph. Invented by an artificer named Robert Dearheart, the towers could send messages "at the speed of light" using standardized codes. Three of these codes are of particular import:

G: send the message on
N: do not log the message
U: turn the message around at the end of the line and send it back again

When Dearheart's son John died due to an accident while working on a clacks tower, Dearheart inserted John's name into the overhead of the clacks with a "GNU" in front of it as a way to memorialize his son forever (or for at least as long as the clacks are standing.)

"A man is not dead while his name is still spoken."
- Going Postal, Chapter 4 prologue

Keeping the legacy of Sir Terry Pratchett alive forever.
For as long as his name is still passed along the Clacks[1],
Death can't have him.

[1] Nowadays called the Internet.

Changing non-critical default configuration with USE flags seems wrong, especially when the packages in question (presumed to be http servers) tend to have semi-lengthy compiles, which are triggered whenever USE flags are changed.

In my (user) opinion, this could be better accomplished by non-optionally adding the relevant lines to the default configuration (possibly commented out/disabled) along with relevant documentation in comments.

Add this option where is indeed the question. We have plenty of places where this could be added which would require a quite some coordination and effort.
I feel like Gentoo has done its part in remembering him by serving the header on *.gentoo.org, interested parties can see on the site you linked that it's really simple to do the same.
