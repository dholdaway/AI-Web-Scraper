When I open a KDE session via kdm or gdm, kdesktop crash after logon. That doesn't happen if I launch kde with startx. This didn't happen before I update kde to 3.5.7. With the previous version (3.5.5), I didn't encounter this problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a KDE session via KDM or GDM
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Kdesktop crash

Expected Results:  
KDE to start correctly and without crash off course

Hi.

You need to at least provide your emerge --info. You should also look into the /var/log/Xorg.X.log and your user's ~/.xsession-errors for relevant info.

In fact, this problem doesn't occur anymore and I don't know how it was solved. I simply re-emerged kdesktop and it was enough to fix it. Sorry for sending false bug reports.
