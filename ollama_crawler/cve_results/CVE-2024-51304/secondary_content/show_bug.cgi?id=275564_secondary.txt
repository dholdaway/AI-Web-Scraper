Description

This already was a problem, with older versions.
In short: Boost does not select itself automatically with eselect. Which results in the failure to install other applications, who rely on that. (Eg. lyx)

So in other words, this is a BLOCKER.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure boost and its assisting ebuilds were never installed on the system.
2. Install an app that needs boost for the very first time.
3. On installation, boost says it selects the version.
4. Install lyx (eg =app-office/lyx-1.6.3), and watch it fail compilation.
5. Run »eselect boost list«, and note the missing star.
(6. Quick fix: »eselect boost set 1«)

Actual Results:  
Boost did not get selected, and lyx failed to install.

Expected Results:  
Boost selecting itself while installing, in *all* cases.

P.S.: I wait and hope for the days to arrive, where I again, can install *one single app*, without something failing. :(
Seriously. I can't remember the last »emerge -auDNtv« world, or app installation, that actually went trough.

This should work now.
