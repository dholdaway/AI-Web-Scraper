The whole build log is more then 2mb, attachment limit is 1mb, 
but something strange happened to me and now I have compiled glibc-2.15-r2, on the same box.

I haven't a clue how it could be related and I even know that it maybe silly but 
prior to this I couldn't compile glibc-2.15-r2.

I remember what I did before. 

Because sshd was crashing, first I had emerged  syslog-ng then started it,
and realize problem of sshd.
After that I re-emerged openssh and did following:

rm -f /dev/null
mknod /dev/null c 1 3

Then I not on purpose started emerge glibc once more and it build.

Excuse me because of my report I cloudn't realize anything before.
Gentoo is running as openvz container, and maybe It has some matters.

If anyone has idea what could happened, it would be appreciated.
Thank you.
