Idol, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Overall, our performance in the third quarter continued to be impacted by softening demand for fashion luxury goods. However, sales trends improved sequentially in the third quarter, driven by better results in our own retail channel while sales in our wholesale channel remained challenged. Additionally, we were pleased to have resolved the Michael Kors Americas Ecommerce implementation issues discussed last quarter and our platform is now running smoothly." Mr. Idol continued, "Versace, Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors continued to resonate with consumers as evidenced by the 10.7 million new consumers added across our databases, representing 13% growth versus last year. In fact, we achieved a new milestone, with our database surpassing 90 million customers. This reflects the strong brand equity and enduring value of our three iconic houses."Mr. Idol concluded, “We look forward to the successful completion of the merger transaction with Tapestry in calendar year 2024. This combination will deliver value to our shareholders as well as provide new opportunities for our dedicated employees around the world as Capri Holdings becomes part of a larger and more diversified company. By joining with Tapestry, we will have greater resources and capabilities to accelerate the expansion of our global reach while preserving the unique DNA of our brands.”The following information was filed by Capri Holdings Ltd (CPRI) on Thursday, February 8, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.
