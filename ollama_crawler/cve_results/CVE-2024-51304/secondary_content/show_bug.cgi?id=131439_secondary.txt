It can get quite annoying, because if they do, they do it incorrectly too often.

This would mean changing every bugs account on the system. If a user files a bug, they have the ability to close their own bug, but not another one that they have no relation to.

So what? Do you want to tel me a script can#t do that!? I'd appreciate, if we had a far more restrictive and user guiding bugzilla like bugs.kde.org.

I'd like you to think again about it. I notice each month a coupe of bugs being incorrectly resolved by users and I'm fed up to look after it. Bugs remain unsolved, while marked so.

Now we have a real prick to deal with, see bug 139582 and bug 137883.

Moving open bugzilla bugs to the new bugzilla group (because I'm about to stab lots of these bugs).

The bug submitter should be able to close their own bugs (say they realize it was a dupe themselves, or that they were at fault). If OTHER users can close it, then please reopon this bug.
