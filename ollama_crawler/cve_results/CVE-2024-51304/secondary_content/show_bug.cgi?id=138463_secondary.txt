env-update does not work.
I installed a game, so portage updated the env.d directory with a path in 90games.
after that I tried to update the PATH variable, but it doesnot work. but no error msg, only that the Path was not set. I also tried source /etc/proflile and I also started a new shel, nothing.
But in pofile.env it was enterded.
Only after a complete restart of the system, the PATH was set.
So for what is that env-update script for?

It updates /etc/profile.env.  After you run env-update, you will need to source /etc/profile in shells that are already running.
