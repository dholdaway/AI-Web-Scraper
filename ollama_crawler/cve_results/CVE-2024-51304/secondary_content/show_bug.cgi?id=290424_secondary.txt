configure.ac

Contains a nasty hack to work around the source not specifying X11/ when including Xpm headers - this obviously could be fixed in the source itself, but I'm trying to stick to the build system.

Perhaps 'pkg-config xproto --variable=includex11dir'
would be a better option ?

The source files are wrong, the correct include is <X11/xpm.h>, it should definitely be fixed that way.

Upstream is not interested in this transition and I'm not keen on maintaining additional build system just for fun. So better we continue use imake until there will be any real problems with it.
