I instlled kde on a Pentium4 with stage 3 and kde over the net install.
I deleted kde games, kde networks,kde toys,kde-pim

Every time when I wrote down commands on the shell (simple commands like dir,
konquerror,diff etc and closed the shell itself,
the whole computer did not react!
I've never seen this in Linux before.
After a while a dialog came up, telling me that the application xterm does not
react and asks if  I want to close that program... But I couldn't! Mouse moves
and even keyboard inputs were blocked! so  I had to restart the machine....

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.install kde
2.unmerge kde network,pim,games,toys
3.do some commands on the shell
4.close the shell by the exit menu-item or the mouse

Try using a vanilla-2.4.21 kernel. Also, which cflags do you use?

i didn't change the cflags from the stage3 tarball.
I had reinstalled gentoo and will rebuild KDE today
