Description


Dan Wilhelm





          2008-01-30 15:23:18 UTC
        

The ANY_ANY variable in vmware.eclass should be changed as follows:

export ANY_ANY="vmware-any-any-update115"

The current value of "vmware-any-any-update114" causes the digest checking to fail since all of the vmware-workstation digests have been updated to "115".

Thank you.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge -f vmware-workstation
2.
3.

Hmmm? It's already there.
