Description

I believe this is the error it stops at: "kmplayer_lists.cpp:(.text+0x3791): undefined reference to `KMPlayer::MediaInfo::wget(QString const&)'"

I normally build kmplayer w/ the cairo and npp flags set. Unsetting them did not change the result. 


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Set AcceptKeywords to ~x86 for kmplayer (necessary to get Flash in Konqueror 4)
2.build kmplayer
3.

version 0.11.1a fails here as well (with Qt-4.5.1). Build log attched.

Sorry about the delay before trying this.
I'm afraid .11a failed too.

Okey i have one suspect, what is your gcc version (the selected one).
Just post emerge --info if you are not sure. Actualy post emerge --info anyway :]

I got the same failure with media-video/kmplayer-1.11.1b.

Switching gcc from 4.1.2 to 4.3.2 solved the problem.

Thanks for testing. GCC 4.3 is part of current, and stable, Gentoo toolchain.
Using anything older than that, you're on your own.
