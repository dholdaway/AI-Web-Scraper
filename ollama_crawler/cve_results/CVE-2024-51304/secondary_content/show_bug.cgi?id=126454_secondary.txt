ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="x86"

about shfs-0.35-r1
shfs.ko should be installed in /lib/modules/kernel_version/fs/shfs.ko instead of /lib/modules/kernel_version/modules/fs/shfs.ko (like for example submount), becouse after kernel recompiling and make modules_install you have to reemerge shfs.

about shfs-0.35-r2 (this is ~x86)
the location is better, but in my mind fs modules should stay all in one place (/lib/modules/kernel_version/fs/shfs.ko instead of /lib/modules/kernel_version/misc/fs/shfs.ko)

The modules is installed into misc/fs now, really don't see what's wrong with it. Closing this bug that doesn't go anywhere.
