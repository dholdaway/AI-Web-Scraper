Needed as dependency by app-editors/emacs-cvs-23.0.60 to enable OpenType font support.

No longer needed for Emacs since the flag has been use.masked in the default-bsd profile (see bug 210411).

Resolving WORKSFORME. Feel free to reopen if you need better support for Indic or Khmer scripts in Emacs.
