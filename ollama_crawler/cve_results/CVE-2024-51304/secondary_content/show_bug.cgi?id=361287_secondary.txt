Doing an emerge -e --keep-going gnome, as a test, results in:

  GISCAN Shell-0.1.gir
  GICOMP St-1.0.gir
/var/tmp/portage/gnome-base/gnome-shell-2.91.93/work/gnome-shell-2.91.93/src/tmp-introspectkotjbT/.libs/Shell-0.1: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib64/libgjs.so.0: undefined symbol: JS_StrictPropertyStub

Did you just upgrade xulrunner-2.0? You need to rebuild gjs.

     Wed Mar 30 06:01:52 2011 >>> net-libs/xulrunner-2.0
       merge time: 15 minutes and 23 seconds.

     Wed Mar 30 06:07:42 2011 >>> dev-libs/gjs-0.7.13
       merge time: 34 seconds.

Have rebuilt gjs several times afterwards, but still the same error. Have now downgraded to xulrunner-1.9.2.*, gnome-shell compiling fine now (apart from some "Failed to load module: /usr/lib64/gio/modules/libgiolibproxy.so" messages, but the emerge does not fail on this)

Do you have spidermonkey installed?
