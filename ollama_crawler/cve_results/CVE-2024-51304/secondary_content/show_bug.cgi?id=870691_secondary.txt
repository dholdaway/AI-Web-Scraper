On my system, binutils cannot be accessed

I had to
cd /usr/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/
ln -s binutils-bin/2.39 bin


to fix my system.

All builds fail with  "gcc cannot create executables"

Unless one finds this fix above a Gentoo system is heavily broken.

There's going to be something way more to this. It's happened to nobody else and it works fine for me.

What happens when you use binutils-config?

Do remove the symlink before trying binutils-config, that's supposed to be a normal directory /in/ which binutils-config will create symlinks.

If you use it as-is it'll try create symlinks over your real binaries (but thankfully fail to).

Many thanks for your quick help.
The question is why binutils-config hasn't been run by emerge.
Or did I miss some NEWS that I had to run it myself?

Anyway, having run binutils-config fixes the problem,
Helmut
