When compiling, errors with the following:

 * Cannot find $EPATCH_SOURCE!  Value for $EPATCH_SOURCE is:
 * 
 *   /usr/local/portage/app-editors/leo/files/leoConfig.py.patch
 *   ( leoConfig.py.patch )

!!! ERROR: app-editors/leo-4.2 failed.
!!! Function epatch, Line 217, Exitcode 0
!!! Cannot find $EPATCH_SOURCE!
!!! If you need support, post the topmost build error, NOT this status message.

Reproducible: Always

Is this the ebuild in portage or a local copy in your overlay? You probably need
to copy the patch to your overlay.

It was a copy in the overlay since amd64 isn't a keyword. I tried unpacking
leo-4.2-final.zip found in distfiles and didn't see the patch. Maybe I looked in
the wrong place?

Try:

cp /usr/portage/app-editors/leo/files/leoConfig.py.patch
/usr/local/portage/app-editors/leo/files/leoConfig.py.patch

Ok, that does work. Not sure why I didn't try looking in /usr/portage in the
first place.

This now compiles on ~amd64. However, to get it to run, I needed to recompile
python with tcltk and X support before it would run. It seems to run fine.
