Description

Baselayout versions 1.12.13 and 1.12.14 have the following on line 90 of /etc/init.d/clock:

# Since hwclock always exit's with a 0, need to check its output.

But of course the word "exits" doesn't have an apostrophe.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Look in /etc/init.d/clock
2. Go to line 90
3. Wince

either is fine.  the reference is to exit as a function, not as an "exit".  less work to leave it alone.
