Cannot install Java.    Emerge sun-jdk require J2SDK..1.4.2.10...  but that is no longer available at the sun site.   Should be upgraded to 1.5 (now that 6 is in beta) or at least to 1.4.2.11.

1.5 is available, but it is package.masked with good reason. See http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/java/tiger-faq.xml for details.

As for the downloadability of 1.4.2.10, the link works perfectly fine for me. Could you please verify?

One of our users verified that the fetch instructions are correct. Please double check.

yes, the link work perfect for me. but when I try to manually download the jdk from the main page http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html the only downloadable version of j2se is the 1.4.2_11.

yes, I did it. but when I try to emerge java-sdk-docs and the ebuild ask to download it from http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html. well, I downloaded the docs and in the same page there's a link to the jdk. because I know I need to download jdk with the next ebuild by hand I directly download it. with the surprise I need a precedent version and without an ebuild for the 1.4.2.11

result: 2 version downloaded and 1 installed
