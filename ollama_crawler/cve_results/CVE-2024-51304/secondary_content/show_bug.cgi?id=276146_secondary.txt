Description


Luis Fernando Schultz Xavier da Silveira





          2009-07-02 03:48:37 UTC
        

When optimisations are on (-On, n >= 1), gcc-4.3.2-r3 compiles a fairly straightforward piece of C code into an incorrect binary.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
0. Compile the code.

Actual Results:  
gcc produces an incorrect binary.

Expected Results:  
gcc produces a correct binary.

Today I tried to solve a problem from the Northwestern-Europe Regional from ACM ICPC 2001 whose statement is very simple and can be found here (http://acm.pku.edu.cn/JudgeOnline/problem?id=1265).

I wrote the following code in order to obtain a solution:
/*
 * Area
 * 	source     = ACM ICPC 2001 - Northwestern Europe
 * 	difficulty = medium
 * 	keywords   = geometry number-theory
 */

#include <stdio.h>

static int gcd(int a, int b) {
	int r;
	if (a < 0)
		a = -a;
	if (b < 0)
		b = -b;
	while (b != 0) {
		r = a%b;
		a = b;
		b = r;
	}
	return a;
}

int main(void) {
	int tc, cs;
	int x0, y0, x1, y1, dx, dy;
	int n, i;
	int l;
	int area;

	scanf("%d", &tc);
	for (cs = 0; cs != tc; ++cs) {
		scanf("%d", &n);

		x0 = 0; y0 = 0;
		l = 0;
		area = 0;
		for (i = 0; i != n; ++i) {
			scanf("%d%d", &dx, &dy);
			l+= gcd(dx, dy);
			x1 = x0 + dx;
			y1 = y0 + dy;
			area+= x0*y1 - x1*y0;
			x0 = x1; y0 = y1;
		}
		if (area < 0)
			area = -area;

		printf("Scenario #%d:\n", cs+1);
		printf("%d %d %d.%d\n\n", (area+2-l)/2, l, area/2, area&1 ? 5 : 0);
	}

	return 0;
}


It is just an application of Pick's Theorem, the standard formula for computing the area of a polygon and the trivial algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two integers.

Anyway, I believe gcc is incorrectly compiling the cross product of the vectors (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) in the line
area+= x0*y1 - x1*y0;

Here are my results:
$ cat a.in
2
4
1 0
0 1
-1 0
0 -1
7
5 0
1 3
-2 2
-1 0
0 -3
-3 1
0 -3
$ cc a.c
$ ./a.out <a.in
Scenario #1:
0 4 1.0

Scenario #2:
12 16 19.0

$ cc a.c -O
$ ./a.out <a.in
Scenario #1:
-1 4 0.0

Scenario #2:
-7 16 0.0

$

I inserted some printf's in the code to actually see gcc is simply ignoring the computation of `area'.

Any ideas on the source of this behaviour? 

Thank you for your attention.

P.S.: I consider this bug severe for it is a bug in the toolchain, thus all my system is vulnerable to it.

Could you please attach this code for convenience sake ?
BTW, this affects gcc 4.4.0 too.

an amusing bug

Now, that really silly.
Following attachment is your code + 2 commented lines.
As you may notice, those two area lines are arithmetically
equal.
Simply exchanging those two lines does nothing.
However if both those lines are exchange AND printf line is uncommented,
code works. If however only the printf line is uncommented, but
the exchange is not made, bug still happens.

Could you confirm my result, as I was using 4.4.0 ?

Upstream says:
Can't reproduce in any active branch, thus already fixed for 4.5.0, 4.4.1,
4.3.4 

Though they're not saying when exactly it got fixed.
Also, it works correctly in 4.1.2.

Result confirmed.

I'm trying to hunt down the commit on the 4.4 branch that fixes this.  Then I'll find it on 4.3 as well.

So, 4.4.1 got released today.
Once it gets into the tree, we'll see if it
really fixes this problem.
Though backporting to stable will still be a problem,
till a new release of 4.3 branch.




Comment 9


Rafał Mużyło





          2009-07-22 13:30:55 UTC
        

OK, 4.4.1 works with 4.4.0 1.0 patch tarball.
It does fix this problem.
But, as already said, that's not really helpful for stable.

IMOP, gcc-4.3.2 should be masked as soon as possible. Let's stay with gcc-4.1.2 stable or stabilize gcc-4.3.4.
I have built all my system with gcc-4.3.2 :) Let's pray for this bug doesn't affects anything critical.

If this is the same bug that affects GCC 4.4.0, I've seen it hit production code. I agree, gcc-4.3.2 needs to be fixed or get masked ASAP. I wouldn't be surprised if this is causing bugs or instability in packages.

          2009-10-07 14:50:37 UTC
        

I think you've missed what I've said -
while 4.4.1 does have its own bugs (like i.e.
tree vectorizing one), this particular one is fixed.




Comment 13

          2009-10-07 14:59:54 UTC
        

I'm talking about this bug:
http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=40747

4.4.0 had it, 4.4.1 fixed it. We were using 4.4.0 for some stuff and it hit real, production code. However, the testcase in that bug report does not fail with 4.3.2-r3, so I think we're talking about different (related?) bugs.

Has the bug that this report is about been located in the GCC bugtracker?

fixed versions are in stable, so we're not going to spend time on older ones
