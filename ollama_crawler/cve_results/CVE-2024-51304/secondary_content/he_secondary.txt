Net income for the year included $14.1 million of after-tax wildfire-related expenses, and an $11.0 million after-tax loss on the sale of investment securities executed by American Savings Bank (ASB) in the fourth quarter. The loss resulted from selling low-yielding securities in order to reduce high cost deposits, strengthening the bank’s balance sheet while positioning the bank for improved profitability. Core net income and EPS1 for the year were $224.3 million and $2.04, respectively, compared to $235.0 million and $2.14 for 2022. For the fourth quarter of 2023, consolidated net income for common stock was $48.8 million and EPS was $0.44 compared to $57.3 million and EPS of $0.52 for the fourth quarter of 2022. Core net income and EPS1 for the fourth quarter were $53.4 million and $0.48, respectively. There were no core net income adjustments for the fourth quarter of 2022.1 Core net income, core EPS, core return on average equity and core return on average assets are non-GAAP measures which, for 2023, exclude Maui wildfire-related after-tax costs and, except for the utility, the after-tax loss on sale of securities resulting from the bank’s balance sheet repositioning executed in the fourth quarter; and for 2022, exclude the gain on sale of an equity method investment recorded in the first quarter at Pacific Current. See “Explanation of HEI’s Use of Certain Unaudited Non-GAAP Measures” and the related GAAP reconciliations.1The following information was filed by Hawaiian Electric Industries Inc (HE) on Tuesday, February 13, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.
