Both companies will carry forward GE's commitment to innovation and continuous improvement, with even sharper focus on their vital, growing industries. They serve vast and valuable installed bases with enviable service franchises that keep them close to customers, day in and day out. I am proud of what our teams have accomplished and excited for our next chapter as GE Aerospace invents the future of flight and GE Vernova leads the energy transition." Culp continued, "In 2023, our teams delivered an excellent year, more than tripling earnings and generating almost 70 percent more free cash flow. At GE Aerospace, we drove solid revenue and operating profit improvement in the fourth quarter and double-digit revenue, profit, and cash growth for the year, reflecting ongoing strength in Commercial Engines and Services. At GE Vernova, Renewable Energy and Power together delivered meaningfully better results, with double-digit revenue growth in the quarter and positive profit and free cash flow for the year. We expect further revenue, profit, and free cash flow growth for both GE Aerospace and GE Vernova in 2024."  GE Aerospace1•Delivered higher orders, revenue, and operating profit in the quarter.

GE Vernova•Renewable Energy and Power drove double-digit revenue growth in the quarter. For the year, together they delivered strong revenue growth, operating profit improvement of over $1 billion, and positive free cash flow, with services representing approximately 65 percent of backlog. •Secured 2.4 GW order to support Pattern Energy's SunZia wind project in New Mexico—expected to be the largest wind project in U.S. history—with 674 onshore wind turbines and a long-term services award.•Reached key milestones toward its spin-off, including naming its Board of Directors, filing its Form 10 registration statement on a confidential basis, and achieving operational readiness.* Non-GAAP Financial Measure1Following the planned spin-off, in which GE will distribute the common stock of GE Vernova on a pro rata basis to holders of GE common stock, General Electric Company will be known as GE Aerospace.
