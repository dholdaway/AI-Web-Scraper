Description

Hi,

After some inactivity (~3 months), I ran emerge @world on my ia64 workstation. Hundreds of packages were upgraded/rebuilt leading to a broken GNOME desktop environment (more on this later). I don't know exactly how the various GNOME packages relate to each other, so it may be that the faulty package isn't gnome-shell itself. It's only because I think that both GDM and the GNOME desktop rely upon it that I've opened this BR against gnome-shell. Feel free to redirect if it proves to be wrong. Now the facts.

At the GDM login screen (attached gdm.jpg snapshot), when I click on my account, the GNOME Settings option and an edit text box (allowing me to enter my password) used to be displayed. Following emerge @world, as soon as I click on my account, GDM is restarted and I can't do much more. It's noteworthy that the calendar and accessibility options however work fine. Forcing GDM to use X11 (uncommenting WaylandEnable=false in /etc/gdm/custom.conf) didn't help, as Xorg is properly started anyway.

Starting a GNOME session from the command-line (startx) allowed me to see the GNOME desktop (attached gnome.jpg snapshot). But as can be seen in the snapshot, the dock, which is normally displayed on the left isn't there. Here again, the calendar is working properly. However, clicking on any of the settings (system, account) or Activities restarts the GNOME desktop. Clicking once again on any of those once the GNOME desktop is restarted shuts down the session. I'm the back to the shell prompt, without any further error message displayed.

Quite interestingly, emerge @world failed to upgrade gnome-shell and mutter to GNOME 3.26 because of bug #671538. I know for sure that =gnome-base/gnome-shell-3.24.3 was working fine during the GNOME 3.24 days.

From the evidences above, if you know which GNOME component may be faulty and reverted to give it a try, or which log file should I have a look at to get more information, please let me know as I'm in the dark here. And if you think that the GDM and desktop problems reported here are in fact two different issues, please let me know too, so that I can open separate BRs.

Thanks,

     Émeric

Do you have any coredumps in coredumpctl or anything interesting in journalctl?
The attached photos themselves seem fine to me - there is no left dock shown unless you are in activities overview, which you don't appear to be in.

mutter and gnome-shell need to be in sync (both 3.24 or both 3.26), other than that - I don't recall any big interdependencies.

gdm itself doesn't do any drawing really, you are seeing gnome-shell in its login UI there as well.

Well, I wish I could. My Gentoo HDD crashed hard and I had to reinstall everything from scratch. But now, I can't emerge GNOME 3.24 because of bug #671538, so can't even start a GNOME session right now.

That being said, I always had the dock displayed on my GNOME desktop previously, not only when in activities overview.

No more problem with GNOME 3.30 (gnome-shell and mutter still at 3.26 because gnome-light > 3.26 isn't keyworded on ia64).

The problem I had at the time is probably different than the one I just hit while stabilizing GNOME 3.30, so just in case: it seem's that nothing requires to install fonts (e.g. cantarell) with gnome-light, thus leading to broken GDM and GNOME Shell. Installing a font (found by accident while installing a minimal testing X environment that has a dependency on font-misc-misc) solves the problem.

gnome-light[gnome-shell] does pull in cantarell.
As does gnome-base/gnome-shell itself unconditionally.

Well, not in the GNOME 3.26 days, it seems. And indeed, media-fonts/cantarell dependency was added in =gnome-base/gnome-shell-3.28.3 in commit a97a41f (https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/gnome-base/gnome-shell/gnome-shell-3.28.3.ebuild?id=a97a41f77a0458f78ee5586151fd2508a5baba80).
