Description

It would be nice to have a set of all packages which install kernel modules.

Rationale: so you can type things like this:
cd /usr/src/linux && cp /boot/config .config && make oldconfing && make && \
emerge -1 @kernel-modules && make firmware_install modules_install install

My simple approach to this would be to walk all installed packages and see which one place files in /lib/modules. Grepping CONTENTS files would be feasible, but I guess there is a much nicer way using the portage python API.

This already exists as the @module-rebuild set.

Thanks a lot! I somehow missed that in the portage documentation. Probably because it's no python class by itself, but simply an application of the OwnerSet class, which I hadn't considered closely enough. Sorry for the noise.
