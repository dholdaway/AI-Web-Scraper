Apparently similar to bugs 624078 and 678626.
"See also" field gives error when I use bugs.kde.org link to refer to upstream bug.

So is this not a bug, was a transient issue, or is it fxed, per your commit to https://bugs.gentoo.org/624078?

My guess is we fixed it some time over the last 3 years. the weird thing is, I thought bugs.kde.org links worked that whole time. They definitely worked before today too.
