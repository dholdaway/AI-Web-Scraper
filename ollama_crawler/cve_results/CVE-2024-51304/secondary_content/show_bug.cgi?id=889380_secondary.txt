I installed Gentoo-aarch64 on my rpi3b and noticed I was getting these nice informative messages after emerging packages Ive never seen before on my default/linux/amd64/17.1/desktop/gnome machine...

So I discovered its due to adding PORTAGE_ELOG_SYSTEM="echo" in make.conf

Is there a reason echo is not default in amd64/17.1/desktop profile?

Its nice to see these messages after EACH emerge as I can be reminded of extra packages needed to be installed for extra functionality & other messages etc without having to dig through logs and the like. Not just be told the first time you emerge the package and that's it...

I often receive messages from packages along the lines of "this message will only be displayed once <insert important relevant package information here> to see this again [go to some log]"

I just figure it would be nice to see every time, thanks.

PORTAGE_ELOG_SYSTEM is a Portage-specific variable, so setting it in profiles doesn't make much sense.

Its default value already contains "echo". See /usr/share/portage/config/make.conf.example.

> #PORTAGE_ELOG_SYSTEM="save_summary:log,warn,error,qa echo"

I'm guessing you overrode this via make.conf on your amd64 system.
