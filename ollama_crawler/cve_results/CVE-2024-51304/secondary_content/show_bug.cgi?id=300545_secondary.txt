Description

I have FEATURES="test". Maybe this caused /usr/bin/cryptest.exe to be installed. Whenever I try to run that binary, I get this error:
# cryptest.exe 

CryptoPP::Exception caught: FileStore: error opening file for reading: usage.dat

This bug may also apply to ~dev-libs/crypto++-5.6

cryptest.exe isn't installed by >=dev-libs/crypto++-5.6.0-r1.
This file should be used only in src_test().
