 Inside Everbridge, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
The general consensus among economists suggests that we should expect a higher recession risk to continue over the next year, which, together with rising interest rates and inflation, could result in further economic uncertainty and volatility in the capital markets in the near term, and could negatively affect our operations.



 Other - Other   Highlight
However, our belief may prove to be incorrect, and we could utilize our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect.

 Other - Other   Highlight
We have generated significant losses since inception and expect to continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future.

 Other - Other   Highlight
The estimate of expected credit losses is based on information about past events, current economic conditions, and forecasts of future economic conditions that affect the collectability.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, we may experience increases in the near future, especially if inflation rates continue to rise, on our operating costs including our labor costs, employee availability and wage increases, consequences associated with COVID-19, the ongoing war in Ukraine and the evolving situation in the Middle East, which may result in additional stress on our working capital resources.
