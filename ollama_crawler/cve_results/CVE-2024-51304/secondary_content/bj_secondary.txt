 Inside Bj's Wholesale Club Holdings, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Sales comparisons can be influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control such as changes in the cost of gasoline and macro-economic factors such as inflation.



 Legal - Other   Highlight
The inherent uncertainty of future loss projections could cause actual claims to differ from our estimates.

In response to general inflationary volatility, we seek to minimize the impact of such events by sourcing our merchandise from different vendors, changing our product mix or increasing our pricing when necessary.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
General merchandise and service sales decreased during fiscal year 2023 due to decreased demand for home goods and seasonal merchandise, as well as lower ancillary income, compared to fiscal year 2022.
