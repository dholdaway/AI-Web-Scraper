Revenue for the three months ended January 31, 2024 was $265 million, representing 12% year-over-year growth. Revenue for the year ended January 31, 2024 was $910 million on a GAAP basis and $911 million on a non-GAAP basis. For the three months ended January 31, 2024, diluted EPS was $0.37 on a GAAP basis and $1.07 on a non-GAAP basis. For the year ended January 31, 2024, diluted EPS was $0.28 on a GAAP basis and $2.73 on a non-GAAP basis. “The market today is looking to increase CX Automation, and Verint is leading the way with an AI-powered open platform. I am pleased to report strong Q4 results, ahead of our expectations. Our differentiated approach to CX Automation enables Verint to deliver tangible AI business outcomes better than any other vendor in our market. Our customers purchase our AI innovation in Bundled SaaS, and we are pleased with our 16% year-over-year increase in Bundled SaaS New ACV bookings in Q4, and our over 20% year-over-year increase in Bundled SaaS pipeline as of the end of Q4. For the current year we are raising our outlook to reflect our AI momentum,” said Dan Bodner, Verint CEO.  Q4 FYE 2024 Highlights•Revenue: Up 12% year-over-year•SaaS Revenue: Up ~28% year-over-year•Recurring Revenue: 89% of software revenue recurring (up ~200bps year-over-year) •Gross Margin: Up ~300bps year-over-year•Free Cash Flow: Up 20% year-over-year for the full yearGrant Highlander, Verint CFO, added, “As we execute our roadmap to become a ‘Rule of 40’ company, we continue our AI investments in the platform, ending Q4 with ~1,300 engineers in R&D and Cloud Operations, and adding resources to our Customer Success team to drive AI adoption by our customers. In Q4, we also aligned our services catalog to our AI offerings by adding value realization services and divesting a manual managed services offering that is being replaced with AI-powered bots.” Highlander continued, “We expect our AI innovation to drive Bundled SaaS growth and free cash flow acceleration. For FYE 25, we are targeting a greater than 40% increase in free cash flow, to approximately $180 million. We expect our largest use of free cash flow to be share buybacks, to further reduce our share count.”FYE 2025 Outlook We are providing our non-GAAP outlook for the year ending January 31, 2025. Our outlook reflects the divestiture of a managed service offering on January 31, 2024 that generated $25 million in FYE 24 revenue.The following information was filed by Verint Systems Inc (VRNT) on Wednesday, March 27, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.

 Other - Other   Highlight
However, if the conflict worsens or expands, leading to greater disruption in Israel and/or to greater global economic disruptions and uncertainty, our business or results of operations could be materially impacted.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight

 Other - Other   Highlight
Although we believe the assumptions, judgments, and estimates we have used in our assessments are reasonable and appropriate, a material change in any of our assumptions or external factors could lead to future goodwill or other intangible asset impairment charges.
