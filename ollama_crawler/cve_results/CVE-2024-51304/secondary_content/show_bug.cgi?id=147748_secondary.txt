Configure fails if dbus is not built with python support, but python support has been enabled:

checking for python module gtk... yes
checking for python module dbus... no
configure: error: Could not find Python module dbus

If USE flag 'python' is enabled, then have the ebuild do:

if use python; then
                ! built_with_use sys-apps/dbus python && \
                  eerror "sys-apps/dbus must be built with Python support"
                  eerror "if the 'python' USE flag is to be enabled"
                  die
fi
