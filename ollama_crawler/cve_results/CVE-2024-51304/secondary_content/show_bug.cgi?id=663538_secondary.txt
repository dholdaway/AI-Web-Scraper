Kea supports host reservations / lease storage in RDBMS like:

MySQL (--with-mysql)
PostgreSQL (--with-pgsql)

As far as i can see both can be enabled at the same time.
Would be nice to have this option when installing through portage.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Check use flags for Kea
Actual Results:  
openssl, samples are supported

Expected Results:  
additionally mysql and postgres are supported

Supported Configure Options can be found here:
https://kea.isc.org/docs/kea-guide.html#configure

This would be nice to add in to offical ebuild... so i dont forget to manually fix ebuilds before upgrades :) Also while you are at it, you could add support for starting control agent in conf/init script.

Patches are welcome. Unfortunately I don't have much time to look into this.

Oh, and the mysql/postgresql changes will likely go into the next 1.5.0 (beta, rc or final) release if I don't forget about it :)

Given that bot 1.5.0 (stable) and 9999 have this integrated now; can this bug be closed?
