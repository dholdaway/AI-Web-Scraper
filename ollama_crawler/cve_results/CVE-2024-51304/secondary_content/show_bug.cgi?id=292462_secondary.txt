Here's an idea from a recent -dev thread, aiming to help in situations when users p.unmask (or ** keyword) a package because they want a particular version at the moment, but later forget about it and get a breakage from some future version that's still unmasked (such example being sys-auth/policykit)

- visibly distinguish (red color and stuff?) packages that are to be 
installed only thanks to package.unmask or ** in package.keywords

- print extra warnings about those entries in package.unmask and ** 
keywords that are not version restricted, if they contain the packages 
to be merged. This could follow the suggestion above - aside from the 
distinguished packages, below the list and above the yes/no (if --ask is 
used) there would be "Warning: the following packages have broad 
unmasks, you sure you want these versions?" and the list.

We have that this some time.

This would easily get annoying and would then again need an option to disable it. I think the marker in the merge list is warning enough.
