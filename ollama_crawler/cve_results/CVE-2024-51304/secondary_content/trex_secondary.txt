CEO Comments   
  Fourth quarter results represented a strong
finish to the year. Sales were above the high end of our guidance range, reflecting strong demand for Trex products heading into 2024. Channel sell-through remained at mid-single-digit levels in the fourth
quarter and channel inventories ended the year at historically low levels, said Bryan Fairbanks, President and CEO. Also, our recently launched products are continuing to gain traction in the marketplace. Notably, our Trex Transcend® Lineage decking line, which offers consumers the look and feel of wood together with heat mitigation technology has garnered
considerable consumer interest, along with Trex Select® T-Rail, our high-performance, value-priced
composite rail system, and the premium Trex Signature® decking line, which replicates the graining and color richness of tropical hardwoods.
