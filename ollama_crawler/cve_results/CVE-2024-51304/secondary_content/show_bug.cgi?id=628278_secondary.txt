Until today 
setting LANGUAGE=de directly in /etc/portage/make.conf
I ever got an emerge message like this:
---
* Messages for package mail-client/thunderbird-52.3.0:
 .... 
 * Sorry, but thunderbird-52.3.0 does not support the de_DE locale
 * Sorry, but thunderbird-52.3.0 does not support the de_DE locale
 * Sorry, but thunderbird-52.3.0 does not support the de_DE locale
 * Sorry, but thunderbird-52.3.0 does not support the de_DE locale
 ....
---
Weird is, I have this variable set before in /etc/locale.conf:
---
# Configuration file for eselect
# This file has been automatically generated.
COUNTRY="DE"
LANGUAGE="de"
LANG="de_DE.utf8"
LC_CTYPE="de_DE.UTF-8"
LC_NUMERIC="de_DE.UTF-8"
LC_TIME="de_DE.UTF-8"
...
---
But emerge gets its own runtime LANGUAGE value from 
/etc/locale.conf:LANG
not from
/etc/locale.conf:LANGUAGE

There are several problems with this bug report.

1. Why are you setting LANGUAGE in make.conf? sys-apps/portage does not use it.

2. "Sorry, but ${P} does not support the ${lingua} locale" is emitted by mozlinguas-v2.eclass. sys-apps/portage has nothing to do with that.

3. /etc/locale.conf has nothing to do with support linguas in ebuilds or source packages.

4. You didn't attach your `emerge --info` like you should have. It would probably point out that your make.conf has a variable LINGUAS defined, which you *should* use to determine which locales your system should support. It should probably read something like LINGUAS="de de_DE" in your case.

5. bugs.gentoo.org is a bug tracker - you're not supposed to a file bug report unless you're certain that your problems are likely caused by an actual bug, and you're certainly not supposed to file bug reports (like this one) to get technical support. Hence the name: bugs.gentoo.org.
