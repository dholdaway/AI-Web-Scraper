emerge --info + fuse-exfat-1.1.0 build log with ld.gold

If building fuse-exfat with ld.gold, there are no warnings or compilation errors, but the thing simply does not work.

# binutils-config --linker ld.gold
 * Setting default linker to ld.gold for x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-2.24 ...     [ ok ]
# emerge fuse-exfat
# mount.exfat-fuse /dev/sde1 /mnt
FUSE exfat 1.1.0
fuse: unknown option `'
# grep sde1 /proc/mounts | echo "fail"
fail

# binutils-config --linker ld.bfd
 * Setting default linker to ld.bfd for x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-2.24 ...      [ ok ]
# emerge fuse-exfat
# mount.exfat-fuse /dev/sde1 /mnt
FUSE exfat 1.1.0
# grep sde1 /proc/mounts | echo "fail"
/dev/sde1 /mnt fuseblk rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,user_id=0,group_id=0,allow_other,blksize=4096 0 0

Same problem with sys-fs/ntfs3g.

The same happens with sys-fs/sshfs-fuse.

The same issue in multiple packages might indicate some issue with a shared library (like libfuse).

I can no longer reproduce this problem with fuse-exfat-1.2.4, fuse-2.9.7, and binutils-2.26.1.
