Description

The last couple of times these two apps have required an update the file sizes have had mis-matchs.

It is easy to fix, FOR ME, as I just digest the ebuilds in question and away it goes, however, I have setup a couple of boxes for, shall we say, less technically savvy, friends and this stops the cron job I have set up from completing the upgrade for them.

As the build works OK after I have digested the ebuilds, I think it is just someone being slack ..

Can the "someone" be asked to double check in future? 

I only ask as it is the same two packages for the last couple of times, not your usual, trivial type of mistake that happens from time to time, but an ongoing problem with just these two apps.

I'm not sure why it happened on this or the remote system, hasn't got anything the same, is even different chipset/cpu.  Just the same ebuilds failed for the stated reason and was fixed with re-digest all machines.

Can re-digesting fix on-board file size reads? ..clutching at straws madly here :-)

OH well, live and learn, I'll keep my eye on it any, OK?

You need to delete the old tarballs from /usr/portage/distfiles; we can't do much about upstream silently changing them without version bump. :(
