I am a bit scared about this idea, but we have some consumers...

should probably be done during version bump, if at all

Out of curiosity, does DirectFB work at all nowadays? And does it work as 32-bit lib with 64-bit kernel? :)

media-libs/libsdl and dev-libs/DirectFB are circular deps in this multilib conversion

It works, I have no idea about the second question.

also mind that FusionSound is now part of DirectFB

This one actually should also block bug 488672 in case we keep it (the patch for cairo ebuild actually includes directfb)

May be drop libsvg* deps? https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=496370#c5

+  05 Apr 2014; Julian Ospald <hasufell@gentoo.org> libsdl2-2.0.1-r1.ebuild,
+  libsdl2-2.0.2.ebuild:
+  remove directfb video support


so this is of no interest anymore... and will save us a lot of pain with circular deps
