Error(s) that match a know pattern in addition to what has been reported in the summary:


Run-time dependency avahi-client found: NO (tried pkgconfig and cmake)
Run-time dependency avahi-glib found: NO (tried pkgconfig and cmake)

avahi-client is controlled by avahi's USE=dbus, which seahorse depends on.

avahi-glib is built unconditionally via --enable-glib.

seahorse's meson.build has

avahi_client = dependency('avahi-client', required: get_option('key-sharing'))
avahi_glib = dependency('avahi-glib', version: '>= 0.6', required: get_option('key-sharing'))

seahorse's ebuild has:

> 	zeroconf? ( >=net-dns/avahi-0.6:=[dbus] )
> ...
> 		$(meson_use zeroconf key-sharing)

So I don't see a way this can happen.
