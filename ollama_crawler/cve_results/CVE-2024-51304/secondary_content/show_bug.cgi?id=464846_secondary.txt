Are you building on real hardware or in a virtual machine ?

btw with gcc-4.7 (at least), you would get -march=cortex-a9, could you try that ?

erm went too fast, that would be "-march=armv7-a -mcpu=cortex-a9"

Also, if I understand http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=46788 (from search a bit your error), you might want to at least test with gcc-4.6.

Thank you, gcc 4.7.2 solved the issue
