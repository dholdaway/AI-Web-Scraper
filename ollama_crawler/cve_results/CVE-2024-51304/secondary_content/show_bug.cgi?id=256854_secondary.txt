The configure script complains about missing 32bit libsane development files and therefor fails.

if you dont provide 32bit libs, there isnt anything wine can do about it

I can't agree with you SpanKY. I have this same problem. I tried to update wine from 1.1.8 to 1.1.14 and found that 1.1.14 and 1.1.13 can't compile on amd64!.
Bug #255467 gave me a hint. In 1.1.13 and higher someone removed that line:

use amd64 && multilib_toolchain_setup x86

readding it in 1.1.14 fixes compiling problem on amd64. Please update ebuild in tree (or mayby there was a serious reason why that line was removed?).

Anyway, error about "32-bit development files not found" was also on libhal, dbus, ldap...

Adding vapier/SpanKY to CC because of comment #3

Please have a look and leave a comment about the removed line for amd64.

I have the same problem with wine-1.1.26 on a 32 bit system (therefore not appending the logs). To be able to continue with my update I cheated by using "-scanner" for wine ;-)

Since your problem is on 32bit system and therefor different to mine, you should either open a different bug or at least provide the logs and info needed to debug it.
My error was due to missing 32bit scanner libs and scanner useflag not masked in my profile, i fixed the second, so no error any more for me.
