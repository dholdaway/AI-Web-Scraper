When i update pango to version 1.8.1 i got this when running firefox (i had this problem before, fixed it, and updated pango, now i have this problem again)

/usr/lib/MozillaFirefox/firefox-bin: error while loading shared libraries: libpangoxft-1.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

So i fixed it by entering "export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib64/pkgconfig" in a terminal and recompile pango by "emerge pango --oneshot"

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge pango on a AMD64 system
2. run a program that requires libpangoxft-1.0.so.0

Actual Results:  
Firefox and other apps that require libpangoxft-1.0.so.0 gives an error about 
missing lib. 

Expected Results:  
firefox and other pango based apps running

Sorry, i had some problems with my previous AMD64 install.
It seems to work flawless now.

Sorry for the interruption
