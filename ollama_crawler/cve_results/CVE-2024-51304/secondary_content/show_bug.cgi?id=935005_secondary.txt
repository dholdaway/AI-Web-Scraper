I don't know what happened, just at one day's daily rolling, the emerge warned me that a lot of packages has file not listed in manifest.

and when I tried to clean the cross-emerge and rebuild the cross-toolcain, I received an error like this:
Calculating dependencies  . ... done!

Dependency resolution took 9.68 s (backtrack: 0/20).


>>> Verifying ebuild manifests
!!! A file is not listed in the Manifest: '/var/db/repos/cross-riscv64-milkv-linux-musl/cross-riscv64-milkv-linux-musl/binutils/binutils-2.32-r2.ebuild'

You are probably missing the thin-manifests setting in metadata/layout.conf for that overlay.

Yes, but crossdev's document doesn't mention this, and this worked fine previously, so does portage change the manifest rules yet?
