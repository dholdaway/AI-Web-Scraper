(NASDAQ:DDOG), the monitoring and security platform for cloud applications, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023."We are pleased with our strong execution in fiscal year 2023, with 27% year-over-year revenue growth, $660 million in operating cash flow, and $598 million in free cash flow," said Olivier Pomel, co-founder and CEO of Datadog. "During 2023, we delivered over 400 new features and capabilities to help our customers deliver on their cloud migration and digital transformation plans."Pomel added, “Looking forward to 2024, we are excited about our plans to deliver more innovation and help our customers with their needs in modern Observability, Cloud Security, Software Delivery, and Cloud Service Management."Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Highlights:•Revenue was $589.6 million, an increase of 26% year-over-year.•GAAP operating income was $27.7 million; GAAP operating margin was 5%. •Non-GAAP operating income was $166.7 million; non-GAAP operating margin was 28%. •GAAP net income per diluted share was $0.15; non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $0.44. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share is adjusted for an assumed provision for income taxes based on our long-term projected tax rate of 21%. 1•Operating cash flow was $220.2 million, with free cash flow of $201.3 million.1 The impact of this change was a reduction in non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.11 and $0.32 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, respectively.

 Inside Datadog, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
However, if economic uncertainty increases or the global economy worsens, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.



 Financial - Expense   Highlight
The level, timing and relative investment in our infrastructure could affect our cost of revenue in the future.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Consequently, any decreases in new subscriptions or renewals in any one period may not be immediately reflected as a decrease in revenue for that period, but could negatively affect our revenue in future quarters.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
This increase was primarily due to an increase of $107.5 million in personnel costs including allocated overhead costs for our sales and marketing organization as a result of increased headcount and increased variable compensation for our sales personnel and an increase of $5.4 million in advertising, sales, marketing and promotional activities.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
This increase was primarily due to an increase of $194.5 million in personnel costs including allocated overhead costs for our engineering, product and design teams as a result of increased headcount and an increase of $14.1 million in cloud infrastructure-related investments.
