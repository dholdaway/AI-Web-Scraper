I was unable to reproduce on any current builds. However this might have happened after bug 411935 and (at the same time as) bug 413785. Either way, PHP and the suhosin patch now emerge successfully.

yes, this bug is no longer relevant, php5.3.10 is no longer in the tree.
There was similar bug about php 5.3.11 (https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=413785 - no longer relevant either), so I forgot about this one.
