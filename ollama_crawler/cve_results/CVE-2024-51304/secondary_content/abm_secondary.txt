Exhibit 99.1
 
 
ABM REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR FISCAL 2023 RESULTS AND PROVIDES FISCAL 2024 OUTLOOK
 
•Grew fourth quarter revenue 4.1% to $2.1 billion, including 3.8% organic growth  
•Fourth quarter net income of $62.8 million and GAAP EPS of $0.96, up 29% and 32%, respectively 
•Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $144.2 million, up 10% 
•Fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.01, up 13%
•Board of Directors approves a $150 million expansion of existing share repurchase authorization
•Fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings per share expected to be in range of $3.20 to $3.40 (1) 
 
NEW YORK, NY - December 13, 2023 - ABM (NYSE: ABM), a leading provider of facility solutions, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended October 31, 2023. 
“Our team executed well in the fourth quarter, delivering 4.1% revenue growth and strong margins, resulting in double-digit growth in net income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Our broad-based organic revenue growth and improved adjusted EBITDA margin was bolstered by strong operating performances in our Aviation and Technical Solutions segments," said Scott Salmirs, ABM's President and Chief Executive Officer. "We also benefited from continued solid performances in our Manufacturing & Distribution ("M&D") and Education segments. Despite ongoing headwinds in the commercial real estate market, Business & Industry ("B&I") posted modest organic revenue growth, which is a testament to our positioning in the Class A market and the overall resilience of the business."
"For full year fiscal 2023, ABM delivered solid performance in what was an unusually difficult operating environment, marked by labor shortages, wage inflation, rising interest rates and softness in commercial real estate. Our team successfully navigated these challenges, and our results highlight the advantages of our end market diversification and relentless focus on our clients," continued Mr. Salmirs. "We continued to progress on our ELEVATE initiatives, which included the completion of the first deployment phase of our cloud-based enterprise resource planning system, including multiple connected applications. Additionally, we expanded the use of tools for workforce management, productivity and optimization, all of which contributed to our financial results."
"Looking to fiscal 2024, we expect generally healthy market conditions for our Technical Solutions, Aviation, Education and M&D segments.  We also anticipate that the commercial real estate markets served by B&I will remain challenged, and that we will be impacted by the reallocation of some business by a large client in M&D. Combined, we expect that these factors, along with protracted labor inflation, will likely keep our enterprise-wide revenue growth rate modest and adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 6.2% to 6.5%(1)." 
(1) When the company provides expectations for adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA margin on a forward-looking basis, a reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP expectations and the corresponding GAAP measures generally is not available without unreasonable effort. See “Outlook” and “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information” below for additional information.
