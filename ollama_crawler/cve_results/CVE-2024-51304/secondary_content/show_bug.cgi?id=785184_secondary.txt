This doesn't appear to be a [-native-symlinks] issue. I can't reproduce.

-- CMake version 3.20.1
-- The C compiler identification is GNU 10.3.0
-- The CXX compiler identification is GNU 10.3.0

...

-- The C compiler identification is unknown
-- The CXX compiler identification is unknown
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:31 (project):
  No CMAKE_C_COMPILER could be found.

I'm not sure what's going on here

It's unclear where this ebuild comes from since it's not present in default gentoo tree, however version available in https://git.pants-on.net/gentoo/portage.git/tree/net-p2p/monero builds like a charm with dev-lang/python-exec[-native-symlinks]
