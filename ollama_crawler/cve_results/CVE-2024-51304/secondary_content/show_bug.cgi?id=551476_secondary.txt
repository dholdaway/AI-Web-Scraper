(don't be surprised by the 45.0.2421.0 version - I bumped it locally)

www-client/chromium-45.0.2421.0 fails in prepare stage in attempt to remove bundled library which is not bundled anymore (v8/src/third_party/kernel)

v8/src/third_party/kernel does not exist
 [31;01m*[0m ERROR: www-client/chromium-45.0.2421.0::portage failed (prepare phase):
 [31;01m*[0m   (no error message)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge =www-client/chromium-45.0.2414.0*
2. 
3.
Actual Results:  
it fails

Expected Results:  
it should have compiled

the line

		'v8/src/third_party/kernel' \

can be removed from the section:

src_prepare() {

}

So... which version actually fails? 45.0.2414.0 or 45.0.2421.0? Or both?

both fail,

I hope you don't expect me to test 45.0.2414.0, too since compilation takes long enough even with a Haswell CPU ;)

Fri Jun  5 02:23:31 2015 >>> www-client/chromium-45.0.2421.0
       merge time: 1 hour, 19 minutes and 52 seconds.

Thanks

You are misunderstanding what that actually does; that list tells remove_bundled_libraries.py which files we want to KEEP, not which ones to remove.

In any case, I have no issue building 45.0.2414.0. Attach a build log please.

Created attachment 404770 [details]
log file of the prepare phase failing

Sorry, can't reproduce it anymore with www-client/chromium-45.0.2414.0 (I'm pretty sure it occurred with both),

anyway ...


Attached you'll find the log with the error for 45.0.2421.0


v8/src/third_party/kernel does not exist



Thanks
