Description

(from rox.eclass)

rox_src_install() {
	if [ -d "$APPNAME/Help/" ]; then
		for i in $APPNAME/Help/*; do
			dodoc "$i"
		done
	fi
	insinto /usr/lib/rox

/usr/lib/rox is NOT where rox is installed. While rox does not adhere to FHS at
all, it does install or suggest users all applications EITHER in ~/Apps or in
/ROXAPPDIR/appname.

rox-x.x.x.ebuild installs in /usr/share/ROX-Filer/. Yet, all subsequent
applications install into /usr/lib/rox/. They really should be together as per
the install.sh file delivered with rox.

APPDIR=/usr/local/apps

This is unacceptable by most distros. However, since all other rox applications
go into /usr/lib/rox, so should rox itself go there. Otherwise, you have rox in
two places. /usr/lib/rox and /usr/share/ROX-Filer/.

IMO Hierarchy should be EITHER:

Base Rox AppDir = /usr/lib/rox

AppDir: ROX-Filer/
        Pager
        Edit
        Systray
.....
etc.

OR, 

change all rox application ebuilds (via rox.eclass) to install into
/usr/share/ROX-Filer.

Implementing this change would require all rox application ebuilds to be revised
 to force relocation to the correct place. Might also be a good time to get all
rox application versions up to date.

I am closing this bug since it is NOT a bug. ROX belongs in /usr/lib/rox, not
/usr/share/ROX-Filer. This was just to highlight the discrepancy between where
ROX was being installed and every single other ROX app. insinto /usr/lib/rox is
good and should remain. It is bug #102228 (ROX 2.3) which needs to be addressed
since old version of ROX installed into the wrong place. Since ROX has it's own
FHS, sticking everything together in /usr/rox/lib makes perfect sense. See bug
#106774 for additional patches to the rox.eclass that require attention.
