I'm unable to merge it:
---

card-piv.c: In function ‘piv_validate_general_authentication.isra.3’:
card-piv.c:2390:9: error: ‘rbuflen’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
    body = sc_asn1_find_tag(card->ctx, rbuf, rbuflen, 0x7c, &bodylen);
    ~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
cc1: all warnings being treated as errors

---

Any insight?

This was already in tree when you opened the bug.

Please open a proper bug if you have issues with the ebuild in the tree.
