  Mozilla Network Security Service (NSS): RSA signature forgery
  — GLSA 200610-06




      
    NSS fails to properly validate PKCS #1 v1.5 signatures.
  
    
Affected packages



Package
dev-libs/nss on all architectures


Affected versions
< 3.11.3


Unaffected versions
>= 3.11.3



Background

    The Mozilla Network Security Service is a library implementing security
    features like SSL v.2/v.3, TLS, PKCS #5, PKCS #7, PKCS #11, PKCS #12,
    S/MIME and X.509 certificates.
    
Description

    Daniel Bleichenbacher discovered that it might be possible to forge
    signatures signed by RSA keys with the exponent of 3. This affects a
    number of RSA signature implementations, including Mozilla's NSS.
    
Impact

    Since several Certificate Authorities (CAs) are using an exponent of 3
    it might be possible for an attacker to create a key with a false CA
    signature. This impacts any software using the NSS library, like the
    Mozilla products Firefox, Thunderbird and Seamonkey.
    
Workaround

    There is no known workaround at this time.
    
Resolution


 All NSS users should upgrade to the latest version:
 
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/nss-3.11.3"

 Note: As usual after updating a library, you should run
 'revdep-rebuild' (from the app-portage/gentoolkit package) to ensure
 that all applications linked to it are properly rebuilt.
