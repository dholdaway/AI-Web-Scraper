Description


Matteo Modesti





          2014-03-02 23:59:25 UTC
        

Hello,
I'm on amd64 and I have a package which needs >=x11-libs/libXi-1.7.1[abi_x86_32] , which requires >=x11-proto/inputproto-2.2.99.1[abi_x86_32] . Problem is that the only multilib x11-proto/inputproto is 2.2-r1 .
Therefore I kindly ask to add multilib to =x11-proto/inputproto-2.3 or 2.3-r1, or change libXi's dependency to >=x11-proto/inputproto-2.2-r1 if it's a sufficient version.
Thanks in advance!
Kind regards
Matteo

That support seems to already be in place.

Both x11-proto/inputproto-2.2-r1 and 2.3 are multilib. However abi_x86_32 is stable.masked so you need to either unmask that flag or add 2.3 to package.accept_keywords or something.
