Description

Incorrect result displayed in KSpread

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Enter in cell A1 the number 32
Enter in cell A2 the formula =A1/3
Actual Results:  
The answer is 0.66666667 

Expected Results:  
10.66666667 

The program doesnt realise that the number doesnt fit in the cell and shows 
only the right hand part. If you resize the cell out and back in again, it 
correctly displays #####

The problem is that the value exceeds the width of the cell. Resize the column and you see the missing 1. While mathematically correct, it's indeed not optimal. I don't know if this is fixed with the upcoming release, but it's nothing we can care for. Please search https://bugs.kde.org/ and file a bug there if you don't find a corresponding one.
