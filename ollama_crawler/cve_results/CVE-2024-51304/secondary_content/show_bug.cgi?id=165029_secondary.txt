Description

It appears that the DBus upgrade from 0.62-r2 to 1.0.2 has broken the GTK print dialogue.

Evince and Yelp cannot see my USB printer anymore. I can only choose to print to lpr and print to file. Both are irrelevant with a USB-printer (Brother HL2030, installed as HL2060 by CUPS).

Firefox, gedit, scribus, openoffice.org, Thunderbird, gnumeric and so on works fine. Only Evince and Yelp fails.

It seems to be related to this ubuntu-bug: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/evince/+bug/66379

I'm seeing the same issue.  Evince won't print after sbus upgrade.  Using the Gnome PDF viewer "gpdf" will print my pdf document, but not evince.

I deleted and then re-added my printer in cups and and now evince is printing again.  My guess is evince chats with cups to get printer options for the printer and uses this to make the tabs for printer options.  If this fails, it won't light the print submit button.

That trick didn't do a thing for me. The USB printer still doesn't show up in the list in Evince and Yelp. But the rest work fine.

Hey, it was a guess  :)
Go into the cups admin UI at http://localhost:631/printers/ and hit the "Set Printer Options" button.  That wasn't working for me.  When I re-added the printer, the set printer options cups feature started working again and that is also when evince started printing.

I have no problems with cups. I can do it through the web-interface or through the Gnome cups manager. Both work fine. But evince and Yelp still cannot see the printer. It doesn't show up in the print dialogue.

This is what I see in the gtk-print-dialogue:

- Print to File
- Print to LPR


No more, no less.

I finally found the solution. GTK+-2.10.6 didn't install libprintbackend-cups.so when compiled after updating dbus. Recompiling GTK+ solved the problem.

Funny though that revdep-rebuild showed no problems.
