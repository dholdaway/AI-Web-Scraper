For the quarter, sales totaled $500 million, a decrease of 13% against a year ago period that benefited from delivery of pandemic related backlog and 5% above the pre-pandemic third quarter of fiscal 2020. Results were impacted by winter weather events in January, which caused temporary shutdowns of our U.S. manufacturing facilities, delivery delays, and reduced store traffic throughout much of the central U.S. Operating margin was 6.5% in the quarter on a GAAP basis and 6.6% on a Non-GAAP basis. Diluted earnings per share totaled $0.66 on a GAAP basis and $0.67 on a Non-GAAP basis.Written same-store sales for the entire La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® network decreased 6% versus the year ago period, with company-owned written same-store sales down 8% in a challenged consumer environment and due in part to winter weather events. Written same-store sales were positive across the entire network and for company-owned stores in November and December, but were significantly challenged in January, impacted by softening traffic, a strong base period, and weather.Melinda D. Whittington, President and Chief Executive Officer of La-Z-Boy Incorporated, said, “We remain optimistic about the mid-to-long-term growth potential for our industry, given structural housing shortages and the expectation of improvements in interest rates and housing affordability, and our ability to disproportionately grow with the consumer. In the near term, despite the furniture and home furnishings industry being in a sustained slowdown, our La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® network is executing well. Results in January, the third month of our quarter, were negatively impacted by winter weather events, which caused reduced store traffic throughout much of the central U.S. and delivery and production delays at our U.S.-based assembly facilities, the source of the majority of our customized upholstery finished product. After January’s weather disruptions, production and deliveries are now back to normal as we focus on servicing our customers and consumers with the high quality, comfortable products they expect from us.”Whittington added, “We continue to make progress on our Century Vision strategy, as we completed the acquisition of a six-store network in the Midwest, bringing the company-owned store network to 184 of the 353 total store network. Furthermore, we recently signed an agreement to acquire an additional two stores from an independent La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® dealer in the South. Our company-owned store The following information was filed by Lazboy Inc (LZB) on Tuesday, February 20, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.

 Inside Lazboy Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Actual results could differ from these estimates, assumptions, and judgments and these differences could be significant.



 Revenue - Product   Highlight
The decrease in sales primarily reflects a decline in delivered unit volume reflecting the absence of the significant backlog built from prior periods that delivered throughout fiscal 2023, combined with lower furniture demand across the entire industry due to a challenging macroeconomic environment.

 Other - Other   Highlight
The Monte Carlo valuation model simulates a distribution of stock prices to yield an expected distribution of stock prices over the remaining performance period.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Intercompany eliminations decreased in fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023 due to lower sales from our Wholesale segment to our Retail segment, driven by lower sales in the Retail segment.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
As a result, if we revise our assumptions and estimates, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.
