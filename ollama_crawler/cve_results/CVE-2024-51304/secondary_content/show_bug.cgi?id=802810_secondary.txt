in particular, wayland doesn't need those at all, but also users of display managers don't need xinit, and i think for most DMs don't need xauth either. xauth and xinit are not super heavy, but imo especially with increasing popularity of wayland, shouldn't be force-installed for all users.

We're migrating people to use the x11-base/xwayland package directly, rather than using xwayland provided by x11-base/xorg-server. Given that that's the case, I think the (already light) benefit for doing this is not worth it.

Thoughts?

i remembered that i need xorg-server for xvfb, which doesn't need xauth or xinit either.

on the whole i'm inclined to agree that this is "low priority", but i think it's still valid. otoh i can also continue maintaining my overlay ebuild.
