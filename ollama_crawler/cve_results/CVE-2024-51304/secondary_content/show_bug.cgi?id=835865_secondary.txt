I'm not sure if this is an upstream bug or not

sys-devel/clang-14.0.0 (/usr/lib/llvm/14/lib/libclang.so.13 -> libclang.so.14.0.0)
sys-devel/clang-14.0.0 (/usr/lib/llvm/14/lib64/libclang.so.13 -> libclang.so.14.0.0)

Reproducible: Always

I think it's not a bug.  The comment says:

# The SOVERSION should be updated only if a change is made to the libclang
# ABI, and when it is updated, it should be updated to the current
# LLVM_VERSION_MAJOR.
# Please also see clang/tools/libclang/libclang.map
set(CLANG_SONAME 13)


So apparently they just haven't changed the ABI.
