 Inside Semtech Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
When using a quantitative approach, changes in our projections used in the discounted cash flow model and public company guideline model could affect the estimated fair value of certain of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.



 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
For example, we have valuation allowance against federal, state and certain foreign deferred tax assets in jurisdictions where we have cumulative losses or otherwise are not expected to utilize certain tax attributes.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
We classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the provision for (benefit from) income taxes line of the Consolidated Statements of Income.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
In the event our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made.

 Other - Other   Highlight
While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of our reporting units, it is possible a material change could occur.
