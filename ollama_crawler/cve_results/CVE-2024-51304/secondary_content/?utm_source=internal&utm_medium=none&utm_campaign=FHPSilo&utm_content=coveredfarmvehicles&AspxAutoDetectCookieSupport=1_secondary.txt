            Motor carriers are strongly encouraged to consult with their legal counsel for guidance on applicability and interpretation. Before operating in states other than Florida, consult with those states to determine whether they will recognize the covered farm vehicle exemptions.
        










WHAT IS A COVERED FARM VEHICLE IN FLORIDA?


                A straight truck or an articulated (combination) commercial motor vehicle is a Covered Farm Vehicle when it is operated in accordance with 49 CFR Section 390.5 and 390.39, for vehicles that operate in interstate commerce and Sections 316.003(14) and 316.302(3), Florida Statutes, for vehicles that operate solely in intrastate commerce, regardless of how the vehicle is otherwise classified for purposes of motor vehicle registration or how it operates at other times. Operating in accordance with the above-mentioned federal and state regulations means the Covered Farm Vehicle meets all conditions, as described below.

                

                        To be eligible for the Covered Farm Vehicle exemption, the vehicle or combination of vehicles must be transporting agricultural commodities, livestock, machinery, or supplies to or from a farm or ranch; 
                        
If it has a gross vehicle weight or gross vehicle weight rating (whichever is greater) of 26,001 pounds or less, it may transport such commodities, livestock, machinery, or supplies anywhere in Florida or the United States; or
If it has a gross vehicle weight or gross vehicle rating (whichever is greater) of more than 26,001 pounds, it may transport such commodities, livestock, machinery, or supplies anywhere in Florida and, if it crosses state lines, only within 150 air miles of the farm or ranch for which the vehicle is operating.


It is operated by an owner or operator of a farm or ranch, or by an employee or a family member of an owner or operator of said farm or ranch;
It always carries a Covered Farm Vehicle designation certificate while operating as a farm vehicle, to allow law enforcement officers to identify it as a Covered Farm Vehicle. (Note: Covered Farm Vehicles registered in other states may have different registration and display requirements);
It is not transporting hazardous materials in amounts that require placarding pursuant to provisions in the Federal Code of Regulations (49 CFR Part 172).
Is not being used in a for-hire motor carrier operation. (Tenants transporting their landlord's portion of crops pursuant to a crop-share farm lease agreement are not considered for-hire motor carrier operators.)










WHAT EXEMPTIONS APPLY TO COVERED FARM VEHICLES?


                Covered Farm Vehicles and their operators are exempt from certain federal provisions governing motor carriers:

                

                        Controlled Substances and Alcohol Use and Testing (49 CFR Part 382)

                Operators of Covered Farm Vehicles shall self-certify that their vehicle meets all of the criteria for exemption by completing the Designation Form (click "Create Certificate" button, above).
