Amarok 2 from svn fails because it thinks Qt is built without STL support.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try compiling amarok

Actual Results:  
Amarok fails to compile

Expected Results:  
Amarok should compile

This must be a bug in how we handle split Qt, not sure where exactly yet...

Can you please confirm this still applies with the latest amarok-2 ebuild?

I can't reproduce this one with 2.0.2, so I'm closing this bug.
