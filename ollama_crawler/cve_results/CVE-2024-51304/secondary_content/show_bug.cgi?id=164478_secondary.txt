A similar bug was marked invalid because I was asking for ffmpeg version bump on the same day it was bumped (!), but I was also asking that --enable-swscaler be turned on, for ffmpeg2theora-0.17 (bug #164469).

This relates to bug #164470 (the old/invalid one) and bug #164469 (bump ffmpeg2theora), and even possibly bug #143790 (0.17 may make that bug go away).

Reproducible: Always

enabling swscaler will break several packages that have not switched to the new api.

for example : 
http://bugs.cinelerra.org/show_bug.cgi?id=390

To comment #2, agreed and understood for the most part.

However, http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/download.html clearly states:
"FFmpeg has always been a very experimental and developer-driven project. It is a key component in many multimedia projects and has new features added constantly. New, official "releases" are few and far between. In short, if you want to work with FFmpeg, you are advised to go along with SVN development rather than relying on formal releases. SVN snapshots work really well 99% of the time so people are not afraid to use them."

If an old version of cinelerra is stopping a better and more stable version of ffmpeg2theora from getting in the tree, I'd be disturbed. The bug you mentioned was created on 20070114, and the last comment was that date as well.  What is considering an appropriate amount of time for fixing something in cinelerra that was deprecated sometime around 20061201?

Well, I'm sure $(every package that is broken by enabling libswscale) upstream will be happy if you can help them upgrading.

But for now, I don't think breaking packages to bump another one is an option.

Moreover, lu_zero will have to be happy with swscale stability to enable it.

@ comment #4:

Points taken.

Considering the nature of ffmpeg itself, I'm sure the stabile ARCH marking won't happen until it's ready.

However, packages that would be API incompatible with implicit DEPEND on "media-video/ffmpeg" by >=media-video/ffmpeg-0.4.9_p20070129 with swscaler should simply be DEPEND'd <media-video/ffmpeg-0.4.9_p20070129.  In that case, at least users would see blockers, right?  Honestly, IMHO, and as you've said, to do anything else would be broken, since those packages would break if ffmpeg was blindly updated.

I suppose some/a-lot-of SLOT'ng work could possibly alleviate this situation if there really are lots of packages that would break?  As I mentioned in my last comment, swscaler code in ffmpeg is at least 2 full months old at this point.  It's not that I think cinelerra (and/or others) is a second class citizen, it's simply that I want to get ffmpeg2theora-0.17 into the the tree-proper, and out of my overlay. ;-)

0.18 is in tree (CVS) but package.masked because of this bug. I was however able to create perfectly working .ogg from .avi with media-video/ffmpeg-0.4.9_p20070129  
installed. Is this bug still valid?

swscaler or not, 0.18 works for me.
