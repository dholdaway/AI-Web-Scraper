Description


Dominik Kozaczko





          2007-08-16 16:46:13 UTC
        

I have similar problem with k3b 1.0.x (I tried several version with same results) burning DVD+-R (DVD+-RW are burnt smoothly without any problems)

Sometimes (couldn't find pattern) k3b ruins first one or two DVDs (after starting the system).

If k3b burns DVD properly, then every time it can't eject it and rarely crashes trying to eject. I can eject DVD only by pressing button on the front panel. Trying "eject" freezes and unfreezes system in loop but without desired effect. More to say - if I manually eject the DVD, drive is unusable. Next DVD (or CD) is not detected. I have to quit k3b and "hdparm -w /dev/dvd". If I reset the drive with k3b running, nothing happens (sometimes system freezes perpetually like with "eject" above). Sometimes even that does not help and I have to do a reboot.

As I said before, DVD-/+RW are handled properly - they are correctly ejected after burning and the drive is still usable. CDs are not affected and handled properly.

Right now I'm trying to figure out if USE="-hal" will help anything.

Previous kernel versions also had this problem.

I'm using cdrkit-1.1.6, dvd+rw-tools-7.0



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
burn DVD with k3b-1.0.x

Actual Results:  
DVD does not eject, drive unusable, needs "hdparm -w" or reboot.

Expected Results:  
Eject DVD properly, do not block drive.

I've contacted upstream about this.

k3b-1.0.4 has been released. Is this problem still present in the new version?

Maybe it sounds like a stupid question, but do you have this problem with 0.12.17?

Did you try to burn DVDs from console just using growisofs? As I see k3b is just frontend to command line utils like growisofs, mkisofs etc. So the problem can be on the lower layer.

Created attachment 141502 [details]
The stdout when the problem of ejecting occurs

This is the logging that I get in my xterm when I try to verify a data-DVD.
I have pressed the eject button on the DVD-writer and inserted the DVD again, but after that it started to produce the ScsiCommand failed texts.
