CUPS web interface reports "Destination printer does not exist!", and cannot print test pages to remote printer. But other applications such as xpdf print flawlessly with 'lpr' command.

Here's my system config:

net-print/cups-1.1.23-r7 +gnutls +nls +pam +samba +slp +ssl
Device URI: http://server:631/ipp/

Solved. I think this should be considered as a bug, though. This is very misleading.

Ask upstream to improve their examples, not a Gentoo issue.
