From the Nvidia Linux Kernel Forum:

"Linux/x86-64 kernels >= Linux 2.6.11 have a bug in their implementation of the
global_flush_tlb() kernel interface that can lead to severe stability problems
in combination with the NVIDIA Linux/x86-64 graphics driver and/or other drivers
relying on the change_page_attr()/global_flush_tlb() kernel interfaces. This
problem is not expected to be fixed before Linux 2.6.14 (final) is released.

The patches below for the 1.0-7676 and 1.0-7174 NVIDIA Linux/x86-64 graphics
driver releases work around this problem. It is highly recommended that users of
affected Linux kernels and NVIDIA Linux/x86-64 graphics drivers apply these
patches."

I was having the same freezes, but fixed it with that patch from zander.

No longer relevant bug about obsolete driver versions. Closing.
