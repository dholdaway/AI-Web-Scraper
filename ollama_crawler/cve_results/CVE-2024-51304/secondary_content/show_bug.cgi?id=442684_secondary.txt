ok, I found via google that blobby needs pulseaudio. So I emerged pulseaudio and blobby runs with sound again. Probably pulseaudio was unmerged during an "emerge --depclean". Could you please check this?

strange - I started an emerge --depclean and nothwing was unmerged.
So I changed the status to RESOLVED and WORKSFORME.
