Binary distros often contain the symbols in a file, making crashes debuggable at least a little bit.  Right now, unless you build mysql with debugging and no stripping, this is impossible.  See:

Reproducible: Always

BTW, I understand that one can enable saving of debug information, but that doesn't really do much good if you run into a bug after you built the app.  Then you have to rebuild and schizophrenically hope to hit it again.

You probably want FEATURES="splitdebug"
