sys-apps/hotplug-20040923-r1

Plugging in a USB camera device creates a device with a group named "plugdev".

#ls -alh /proc/bus/usb/003/
-rw-rw----  1 root plugdev 57 Mar 10 21:50 010

All other devices within /proc/bus/usb are created with root.usb ownerships except this usb camera (usable via gphoto2/gtkam).  I'm guessing this issue originates via sys-apps/hotplug?

No, hotplug does not modify this.  I bet it's a gphoto script somewhere.

It is libgphoto and deals with the automounting of devices.

One thing to note, I'm having to modify the udev script to make sure all my usb devices are "group" readable.  

If root is only allowed to use the devices, why even plug in the device to begin with? :-)
