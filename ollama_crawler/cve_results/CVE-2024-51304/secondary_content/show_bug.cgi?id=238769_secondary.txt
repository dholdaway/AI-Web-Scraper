When emerging warzone2100, it will fail EVERY time, if you did not emerge libsdl with the xv USE flag. The current warzone2100 ebuild does not warn about this when it crashes, nor does it say anywhere about this requisite.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.USE="-xv" emerge libsdl
2.ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~amd64" emerge warzone2100

Actual Results:  
It fails compiling warzone2100 concerning sdl type Atom.

Expected Results:  
Should have warned about the necessary USE flags in the libsdl package

we'll pick this up later with use-based deps.

tried warzone2100-2.1.0.ebuild with libsdl built without the xv use flag for libsdl and it worked for me.  Maybe it's been fixed up in the latest version.
