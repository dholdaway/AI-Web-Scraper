NEW YORK, NY — February 27, 2024 — IMAX Corporation (NYSE: IMAX) today reported financial results for the Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2023, highlighted by strong top and bottom-line growth for the full-year. 
 
“IMAX delivered excellent results in 2023 — we grew Net Income by $48 million, Adjusted EPS by 88 cents, Adjusted EBITDA by 52%, and system installations by nearly 40%  — on the strength of demand for our technology, our unique premium model, and a clear preference among consumers worldwide for awe-inspiring IMAX experiences,” said Rich Gelfond, CEO of IMAX.
 
“As the entertainment landscape transforms, it is clear that IMAX is among its premier, in-demand destinations. We drove significant expansion and diversification of our global footprint, with a record 61 of our system installations coming from strategic Rest of World markets such as Japan, South Korea and Europe. Even as we deliver an outsized share of the global box office, we estimate the current IMAX network is only at 47% penetration — with the opportunity to open nearly 2,000 additional locations worldwide.”
 
“Our strong network growth is a direct result of our global content strategy, which has yielded the biggest and most diverse portfolio of IMAX Experiences ever. 2023 saw IMAX deliver a record at the North American box office, highest grossing year ever for local language films and overall box office approaching our best year ever. We are strategically managing our content portfolio to drive greater share of Hollywood releases, grow local language, accelerate our pipeline of IMAX Documentaries, and push further into emerging verticals including music and gaming, live experiences and recurring programming.”
 
“Through our global technology platform, IMAX powers awe-inspiring experiences for audiences around the world — capitalizing on the limitlessness of human imagination and need for shared experiences. We look forward to further capturing this opportunity, growing our network and content portfolio, to deliver results for our shareholders.”

 Inside Imax Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Revenue - Product   Highlight
(Refer to “Risk Factors — The Company conducts business internationally, which exposes it to uncertainties and risks that could negatively affect its operations, sales, and future growth prospects.”



 Other - Other   Highlight
(Refer to “Risk Factors ― Failure to respond adequately or in a timely fashion to changes and advancements in technology could negatively affect the Company’s business.”)

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
These indicators could include a decline in the Company’s stock price and market capitalization, a significant change in the outlook for the reporting unit’s business, including projections of future box office results and IMAX System installations, lower than expected operating results, increased competition, legal factors, or the sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Theater operators and, in certain situations, movie studios, may experience financial difficulties that could cause them to be unable to fulfill their payment obligations to the Company.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
If, after recording a valuation allowance, management’s projections of future taxable income and other positive evidence considered in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance prove, with the benefit of hindsight, to be inaccurate, it could prove more difficult to support the realization of these deferred tax assets.
