 Inside Weave Communications, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Actual results could differ and may materially impact our financial statements in future periods.



 Financial - Expense   Highlight
However, our cost of revenue has been and will continue to be affected by a number of factors including increased regulatory fees on texting and phone calls, the quantity and aging of phones provided to customers, our stock-based compensation expense, and the timing of the amortization of internal-use software development costs, which could cause it to fluctuate as a percentage of revenue in future periods.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
Our gross margin improvement is derived from a favorable customer mix as a greater portion of our customers had fully depreciated phone hardware, and from reductions in third-party costs incurred for specific platform features and overall data usage as part of our cost management efforts.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
As and to the extent in-person events and conferences continue to return to pre-pandemic levels of activity, we expect that our sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase compared to 2023.

 Other - Other   Highlight
