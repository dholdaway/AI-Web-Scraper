What would this ssl USE flag actually do? Is there a ./configure option that the ebuild doesn't know about?

this flag must enable or disable ssl support for postgresql-server. 
At this moment I have next USE flags for ebuild
dev-db/postgresql-server-8.3.3  USE="nls -doc -perl* -python* (-selinux) -tcl -uuid -xml"

but for configure we can on/off:
--with{out}-pam
--with{out}-openssl
--with{out}-ldap

We can see next opts

The contrib makefile, also includes checks for openssl uuid-ossp and libxml2.

from postgresql-base ebuild:

RDEPEND="kerberos? ( virtual/krb5 )
        pam? ( virtual/pam )
        readline? ( >=sys-libs/readline-4.1 )
        ssl? ( >=dev-libs/openssl-0.9.6-r1 )

I think that should handle this issue. If there's anything missing feel free to reopen this bug :)
