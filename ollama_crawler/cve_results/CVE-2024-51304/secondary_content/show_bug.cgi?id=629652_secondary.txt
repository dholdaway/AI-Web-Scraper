Thanks for the report.

As requested, post your emerge --info. I Can't reproduce this on my machine, the --with-lisp option is not get filled but SBCL seems installed on your side. You can try forcing USE="sbcl". 

Anyway, stumpwm is dropping support for other common lisps apart of SBCL (so our ebuild will do) and next release (1.0.1) is comming out soon, you can try when the new version arise.
