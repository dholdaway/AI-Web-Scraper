I'm not seeing an error here.  Not everyone wants nano, so it makes sense to remove it if another editor is installed.  To keep nano just run 'emerge --noreplace nano'

the virtual/editor ebuild has been that way for years now (almost a decade).  the stages should have it selected by default.

what command exactly are you running ?
