 Allison Transmission Announces Record Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Results 
 


 

 
 Record Full Year Net Sales of $3,035 million, up 10% from 2022 
 


 

 
 Record Full Year Diluted EPS of $7.40, up 34% from 2022 
 


 

 
 Record Fourth Quarter Net Sales of $775 million, up 8% year over year
  


 

 
 Fourth Quarter Diluted EPS of $1.91, up 26% year over year  
INDIANAPOLIS, February 13, 2024  Allison Transmission Holdings Inc. (NYSE: ALSN) today reported an 8 percent increase in
fourth quarter net sales from the same period in 2022, propelling full year net sales to a record $3.04 billion. Diluted EPS for the year increased 34 percent from 2022 to a record $7.40. 
David S. Graziosi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Allison Transmission commented, Allisons fourth quarter marks the highest fourth
quarter revenue in our history, leading to a record year driven by strong demand in our largest end markets, and the dedication from our team to realize growth objectives. Our commitment to operating performance was demonstrated by 2023 year over
year EBITDA margin expansion of 180 basis points and Adjusted Free Cash Flow growth of 37 percent.  Graziosi continued, Throughout the
year, we maintained our well-defined approach to capital allocation by increasing our dividend for the fourth consecutive year and repurchasing over $260 million of our common stock, representing nearly 6 percent of outstanding shares.
Through increased earnings and reduction in share count, we are pleased to report record full year Diluted EPS of $7.40 per share. As a result of resilient demand in our largest end markets, at the midpoint we are guiding to another record revenue
year for 2024 as we continue to realize our investments and expand our addressable markets.  Full Year and Fourth Quarter Financial Highlights
 Net sales for the year were $3,035 million. Record annual results are attributed to: 
 


 

 
 A 13 percent increase in net sales in the North America On-Highway
end market principally driven by strength in customer demand for Class 8 vocational and medium-duty trucks,   


 

 
 An 18 percent increase in net sales in the Service Parts, Support Equipment and Other end market, leading to
record full year net sales of $696 million, principally driven by higher demand for global service parts, support equipment and aluminum die cast components and price increases on certain products, 
 


 

 
 A 14 percent increase in net sales in the Defense end market principally driven by increased demand for
Wheeled and Tracked vehicle applications, and   


 

 
 Record net sales of $477 million in the Outside North America
On-Highway end market, driven by the continued execution of our growth initiatives, including a 21 percent increase in Europe, Middle East and Africa net sales, led by strong sales in vocational truck.
 Net income for the year was $673 million. Diluted EPS for the year was $7.40. Adjusted EBITDA, a
non-GAAP financial measure, for the year was $1,108 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year was $784 million. Adjusted free cash flow, a
non-GAAP financial measure, for the year was $659 million.

 Inside Allison Transmission Holdings Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 M & A - Other   Highlight
In addition, the Credit Agreement includes, among other things, customary restrictions (subject to certain exceptions) on our ability to incur certain indebtedness, grant certain liens, make certain investments, engage in acquisitions, consolidations and mergers, declare or pay certain dividends, and repurchase shares of our common stock.



 Other - Other   Highlight
In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) authoritative accounting guidance on goodwill, we do not amortize goodwill but rather evaluate it for impairment on an annual basis, or more often if events or circumstances change that could cause goodwill to become impaired.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Some factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include the number of transmissions that will be affected by the incentive program and the rate of acceptance of any incentive program.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Any changes to the assumptions and estimates resulting from changes in actual results or market conditions from those anticipated may affect the carrying value of long-lived assets and could result in an impairment charge.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
The need to establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets is assessed at least quarterly based on a more-likely-than-not realization threshold, in accordance with the FASB authoritative accounting guidance on income taxes.
