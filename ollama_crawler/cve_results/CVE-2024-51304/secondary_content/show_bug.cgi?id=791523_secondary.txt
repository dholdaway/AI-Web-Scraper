Can you try to run `which rustc`, `which rustup`, `rustc -Vv` and `eselect rust show` and paste the output?

Your rust installation is busted. With some luck it's just the ldcache because you switched recently (just try calling `ldconfig`). If `rustc -Vv` still does not work you will probably have to re-emerge rust.

ldconfig and re-emerging rust did nothing.

Most likely fixed now with newer rust/firefox versions.
