Hi,

i think it is usefull to build a peudo ebuild which create a symlink to
javapugin for firefox.
After creating this symlink you have java runing with firefox.

example: ln -s
/opt/blackdown-jre-1.4.2.02/plugin/i386/mozilla/libjavaplugin_oji.so
/usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins/libjavaplugin_oji.so

will work for me.

other idea ist to set this symlink automaticly when java is USE for firefox.

Think about it ;-)

This doesn't work. As soon as you update Java, the symlink is dead. The
mozilla-launcher script could do this, though.

this should be handled by java package weather it be blackdown-jre or
blackdown-jdk even sun builds should link the plugin with nsplugin or nsbrowser
which is loaded from /usr/lib{32|64}/nsbrowser/nsplugin.

That's what USE=nsplugin in java-* ebuilds is for.
