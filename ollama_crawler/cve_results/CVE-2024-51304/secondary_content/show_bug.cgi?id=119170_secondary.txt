There is no volume control for rhythmbox-0.9.2 under FVWM
It is not just a missing icon. There is physically no place you can click to get the volume control popup to show up.

Could you please try media-sound/rhythmbox-0.9.3.1 and see if this is fixed?

Visible icon still missing but not completely absent now. Under 0.9.3.1 there is now a 5px (or so) wide area that you can click on to get to the volume control. 

Any ideas?

I have this problem as well using Fluxbox and Rhythmbox on a x86 Pentium 4M laptop.

This thing? (never used rhythmbox before)

It seems to work fine for me, it doesnt sound like something that would be window manager dependent.
