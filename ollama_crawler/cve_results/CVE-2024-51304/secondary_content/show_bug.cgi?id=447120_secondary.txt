I have SYNC="rsync://mirrors.eu.kernel.org/gentoo-portage/" in /etc/portage/make.conf, and for several days I am getting this message when running "eix-sync"

>>>
>>> SERVER OUT OF DATE: rsync://149.20.4.71/gentoo-portage/
>>>
>>> In order to force sync, remove '/usr/portage/metadata/timestamp.chk'.

FYI, the hostname revolves to a single IP:

taz ~ # host mirrors.eu.kernel.org
mirrors.eu.kernel.org has address 149.20.4.71
mirrors.eu.kernel.org mail is handled by 20 zeus1.kernel.org.
mirrors.eu.kernel.org mail is handled by 30 zeus2.kernel.org.
mirrors.eu.kernel.org mail is handled by 999 bl-ckh-le.kernel.org.
mirrors.eu.kernel.org mail is handled by 10 mail.kernel.org.

I don't actually see this mirror in our list at all, so I don't think we monitor it or care if it is behind (although it appears to have caught up?)

http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/mirrors-rsync.xml lists the mirrors we advertise.
