I had the very same problem.

postgrey[5956]: FATAL: Can't locate object method "new" via package "IO::Multiplex" at /usr/lib64/perl5/vendor_perl/5.16.3/Net/Server/Multiplex.pm line 39.	

after installing

[ebuild     U  ] dev-perl/IO-Multiplex-1.130.0 [1.09] 16 kB


it works for me.

So I guess the dependency needs to be bumped.
