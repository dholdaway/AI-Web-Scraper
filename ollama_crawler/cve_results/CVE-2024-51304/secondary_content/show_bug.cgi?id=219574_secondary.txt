please try with 2.22. Also if it's only for oc language please report a bug upstream to ask them to use only one dtd pretty please :)

I tried 2.22 without, and with the docbook-xml-simple-dtd, and both gave me the following error:

guys, wrt to 2.22.0, it builds fine here with or without internet access with only docbook-xml-dtd-4.3 for FEATURES=test and none at all for regular install (compiling with ALL locales)

@robert, please list your docbook dtds installed, if you have 4.3 please reinstall it, maybe your catalog is corrupted.
