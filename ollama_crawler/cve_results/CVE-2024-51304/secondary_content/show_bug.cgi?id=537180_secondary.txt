SYMPTOM
audacious quits after files have been added to the playlist and a title is played for a couple of seconds.

CURE
Using gdb's backtrace feature reveals that the error stems from the audpl playlist plugin.

Since the configuration within /home/user/.config/audacious had been created and used by previous versions of audacious, the config was completely removed
  rm -rf /home/user/.config/audacious

and this seemed to fix the problem, i.e. autosaving the playlist works again.  This bug report is mainly for users experiencing similar problems (and, if read, for devs of audacious to maybe fix the issue if the backtrace is enough to fix it; there's no backup of the old config).
