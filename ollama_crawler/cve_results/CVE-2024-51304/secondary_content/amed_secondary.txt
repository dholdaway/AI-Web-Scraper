Our company-specific impact of the hospice final rule could differ based on our mix of patients and differences in the wage index.



 Other - Other   Highlight
Limited risk admissions are admissions for which we assume the risk for certain healthcare services during the remainder of an inpatient acute stay serviced at the patient's home in exchange for a contracted per diem payment.

 Financial - Debt   Highlight
In addition to our collection of patient accounts receivable, from time to time, we can and do obtain additional sources of liquidity by the incurrence of additional indebtedness.
