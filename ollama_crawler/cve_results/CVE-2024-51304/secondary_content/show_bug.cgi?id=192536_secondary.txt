Running in console causes:

AAlib: signal 11 received
Segmentation fault

and scrables whole keyboard input.

Way to avoid this, is to quick switch to another tty for a moment.

> Running in console causes:

Running *what*?

Reopen with:

- exact ebuild name and version this is about
- emerge --info
- backtrace attached (see http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/qa/backtraces.xml)

Anyway it is probably games-engines/scummvm-0.9.1 bug or my sytem failure.

Game runs fine under X.

reopen if this is still a problem with the latest scummvm.
