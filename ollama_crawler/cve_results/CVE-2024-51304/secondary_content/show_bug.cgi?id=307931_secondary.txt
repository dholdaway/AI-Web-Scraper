After upgrading from 4.3.3 to 4.3.5, I get popup messages that kmail cannot start pop3 (or pop3s, or imap) process when attempting to retrieve mail. Filing as gentoo bug because it looks like a missing/broken dependency to me (Yes I ran revdep-rebuild until it could not find anything broken anymore). 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
(that's how to reproduce on my system. I have no testing system available for larger experiments.)
1. emerge ~kde-base/kmail-4.3.3
2. configure some accounts
3. emerge -u kde-base/kmail
4. run kmail & attempt to retrieve new mail.
Actual Results:  
Error popup message telling that the process pop3 (or pop3s, or imap) could not be started.

This can happen when you update KDE while running KDE. Logging out and back in again should solve the issue.

Does it work now for you, or does the problem persist?

Of cause a full KDE restart was the first thing I attempted. Nevertheless, after masking PyQt-4.7 and repeating the upgrade everything worked just fine.
