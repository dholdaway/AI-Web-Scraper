Please add ebuild for new version of kcm_touchpad to portage or may be some overlay. It's extermely more powerfull then current stable 0.3.1 and synaptiks. For example it has an option to turn of touchpad when typing. 
I have compiled it on amd64 successfully but I'm not good on making ebuilds. kcm_touchpad-9999 from kde overlay is for old version too.

Do you mean kde-misc/kcm-touchpad from the KDE overlay?

Yes, you're right.

Resolving, then. We avoid putting live ebuilds in the tree.
