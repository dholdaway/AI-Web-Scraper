I'd say ImageMagick sets the standard here. Please use mupdf/ sub directory for the headers.

See bug 503690

In fact, let me take a closer look first.

$ grep -r -i fitz *
configure:    ac_fn_c_check_header_mongrel "$LINENO" "mupdf/fitz.h" "ac_cv_header_mupdf_fitz_h" "$ac_includes_default"
configure:if test "x$ac_cv_header_mupdf_fitz_h" = xyes; then :
configure.ac:    AC_CHECK_HEADER(mupdf/fitz.h,passed=`expr $passed + 1`,failed=`expr $failed + 1`,)

Only in configure.ac?

I should have looked, they ARE in the mupdf/ sub directory at least in version 1.3
