In two files (resource/kolabproxy/calendarhandler.cpp and resource/kolabproxy/kolabhandler.cpp) in the kdepim-runtime portion of the akonadi 4.3.61 compile, the #include of the Akonadi::KCalMimeTypeVisitor library has the location wrong.  Instead of #include <akonadi/kcal/kcalmimetypevisitor.h>, it should be #include <kcal/kcalmimetypevisitor.h>.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge akonadi-4.3.61 from the kde-testing overlay

Actual Results:  
The compile failed around 53%

Expected Results:  
I would expect (read: hope) it to finish compiling and installing

I've made the patch file to fix the errors in the two places where I found them.  I plan to upload my patch as soon as I finish the bug report, but ... well, this is the first time I've posted an error to bugzilla (this is the first time that I've had an issue that I couldn't find a fix for posted elsewhere), so I'm not entirely sure that I'll be able to post a patch file or ... anything.

Patch to fix directory structure errors

This is the patch I made to fix the (admittedly minor) errors that I found in those two files.
