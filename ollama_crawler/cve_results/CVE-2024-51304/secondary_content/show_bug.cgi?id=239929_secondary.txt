I don't know the build system for this program (and this is a generic bug template so I cannot tell you which program exactly is), but my tests shows that it's not respecting CFLAGS properly.

Please look into it, since it's important to respect user CFLAGS.

Thanks,
Diego

Great, I just committed a new version as fix for bug 239869 one minute ago. :-(

Couldn't you have reported these two build system issues in one single bug, to avoid duplicate work for package maintainers?

Patches are welcome. :p

I was going through the whole list of app-editors/*, but since I grep the logs for one condition first and the other after, they get reported separately... sorry but you're the _only_ person who ever responded to a bug I've been reporting so quickly...

Hm, src_unpack does:
    sed -i -e "s:^OPTFLAGS =.*:OPTFLAGS = ${CFLAGS}:" Makefile

And my CFLAGS are respected during compilation:
>>> Compiling source in /var/tmp/portage/app-editors/jove-4.16.0.70.3/work/jove4.16.0.70 ...
gcc -O -march=pentium-m -O2 -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer -DBSDPOSIX_STDC   -c -o commands.o commands.c
gcc -O -march=pentium-m -O2 -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer -DBSDPOSIX_STDC   -c setmaps.c
[...]

So what exactly is the issue?

Closing (as discussed on IRC). Maybe the ebuild is not using the most elegant solution, but CFLAGS are respected.
