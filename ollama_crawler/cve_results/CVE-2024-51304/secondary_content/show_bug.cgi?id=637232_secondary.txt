hello,
every time, i will update my system, i get depency problems and one of this package is zlib because some packages want different versions. but i think, that all can work with the same version of zlib!

please correct this zlib depencies chaos:

try to add larger --backtrack= option to your world update command.
Like --backtrack=100.

hello,
i try this, but it don't help.

at the moment i have so much problems to update my system, it is terrible.

as sample, why need i chromium to reinstall many libs and imagemagick?

i think, i must make make much work and need much time to get my system up to date and if i must update to gcc 5.x, this is horrible with the actual depency-problems.

goodby

You certainly don't switch to GCC-5 as long as your system is in limbo like that. That's just multiplying your problems.

Bugzilla is not a good place to get help with this.

I suggest seeking help in support channels:

- #gentoo in Freenode IRC
- Gentoo Forums
- Gentoo User mailing list

It is sad to read that you have problems with the software. The situation seems to be a bit more complicate and requires some analysis.
We can not help you efficiently via bug tracker. The bug tracker aims rather on specific problems in .ebuilds and less on individual systems. 

I have had very good experience on the gentoo IRC [1] with questions like this. Of course there are also forums and mailing lists [2,3].
I hope you understand, that I will close the bug here therefore and wish you good luck on one of the mentioned channels [4].
Please reopen the ticket in order to provide an indication for an specific error in an ebuild or any gentoo related product.

hello,
i think, this problem comes from some ebuilds which where not updated to the new zlib in the depencies.

i think a check, that all ebuilds use the actual zlib and update the ebuilds will solve this problem.
