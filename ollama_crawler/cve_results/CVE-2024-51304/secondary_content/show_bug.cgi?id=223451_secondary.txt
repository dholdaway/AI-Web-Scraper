Will provide build log, environment, eclass-debug, java sanity check, emerge info as attachments asap.
sys-libs/db-4.5.20_p2 failed while running "emerge gnome" on a fresh 2008 beta2 install several days ago. I masked sys-libs/db-4.5.20_p2 and completed the "emerge gnome". Numerous subsequent attempts to emerge sys-libs/db-4.5.20_p2 (with sys-libs/db-4.5.20_p2 unmasked) have failed.  Using sys-libs/db-4.3.29-r2 seemed to be okay ubtil an attempt to emerge mythtv with a dvb use flag failed because  dev-util/subversion-1.4.6 specifically required sys-libs/db-4.5.20_p2.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge db or emerge -uND world
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
<snip>
/var/tmp/portage/sys-libs/db-4.5.20_p2/work/db-4.5.20/build_unix/../dist/../mutex/mut_tas.c: In function '__db_tas_mutex_lock':

make: *** [mut_tas.lo] Error 1
 * 
 * ERROR: sys-libs/db-4.5.20_p2 failed.
 * Call stack:
 *               ebuild.sh, line   49:  Called src_compile
 *             environment, line 4193:  Called die
 * The specific snippet of code:
 *       emake -j1 || die "make failed"
 *  The die message:
 *   make failed


Expected Results:  
successful compile

java involved??

please do not attach tarred attachments.
emerge --info should be just included straight into bugzilla.

If you update your toolchain fully, it should build fine, if you're on a hardened system and it doesn't, try the ~arch versions, and please update with emerge --info and a couple more lines of context on both sides of the error output.
