FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                     PENSKE AUTOMOTIVE GROUP REPORTS QUARTERLY AND FULL YEAR 2023 RESULTSCompletes Third Most Profitable Year in Company HistoryFourth Quarter Revenue Increased 4% to $7.3 BillionFourth Quarter Retail Automotive Same-Store Revenue Increased 4%, Including a 7% Increase in Service & PartsFourth Quarter Profitability Impacted by Non-Cash Impairment Charge, Lower Equity Earnings From PTS, and Higher Interest Expense BLOOMFIELD HILLS, MI, February 7, 2024 – Penske Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE: PAG), a diversified international transportation services company and one of the world's premier automotive and commercial truck retailers, today announced fourth quarter and twelve months 2023 results. For the quarter, revenue increased 4% to $7.3 billion. Income from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders decreased 36% to $190.7 million from $298.0 million and related earnings per share decreased 33% to $2.84 from $4.21 when compared to the same period of 2022. Fourth quarter 2023 results include a goodwill impairment charge of $40.7 million (before and after tax), representing $0.61 per share. Excluding the goodwill impairment charge, adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders decreased 22% to $231.4 million from $298.0 million and related adjusted earnings per share decreased 18% to $3.45 from $4.21. Foreign currency exchange positively impacted revenue by $130.0 million and had a negligible effect on income from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders and earnings per share.Goodwill ImpairmentWe are required to assess goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually. In the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with our annual budget and planning process for 2024, which drives certain assumptions used in our annual goodwill impairment testing, we determined the carrying value of goodwill in our used vehicle dealerships international reporting unit was greater than its estimated fair value. Accordingly, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $40.7 million (before and after tax) for the quarter, which represents $0.61 per share for the three months and $0.60 per share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. This impairment charge is largely related to the reporting unit’s lower supply of quality, low mileage used vehicles for its customers due to lower sales of new vehicles across the industry in recent years.Fourth Quarter 2023 PerformanceThe Company’s results for the fourth quarter of 2023 were driven by continued strong performance in retail automotive and retail commercial truck operations, including an 8% increase in retail automotive new units delivered and a 7% increase in same-store service and parts gross profit. Income from continuing operations before income taxes, net income, and income per share, however, were negatively impacted by higher interest costs of $21 million, driven primarily by an increase in interest rates and higher inventory levels which increased borrowings under our floorplan arrangements, and lower equity earnings 1The following information was filed by Penske Automotive Group, Inc.
