Description

These are the packages that I would merge, in order:

Calculating world dependencies                        l
emerge: there are no ebuilds to satisfy ">=x11-libs/motif-config-0.6".

!!! Problem with ebuild kde-base/kdegraphics-kfile-plugins-3.4.0
!!! Possibly a DEPEND/*DEPEND problem.

!!! Depgraph creation failed.

I had motif-config-0.8 merged and have it in my $PKGDIR, but only 0.1 exists in the portage tree.  What's stranger, the portage tree motif-config CHANGELOG mentions nothing beyond 0.1, with a last entry back in February.  Whatever happened to the newer versions, and why wasn't this ebuild modified to reflect it when they were removed?

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge -pvuD world with kdegraphics-kfile-plugins merged.

Run emerge sync and reopen if the problem persists.

Works here now, too.  Must have been either a bad sync, or yet another issue with portage-2.0.51.20-r1, which I had merged for a bit, until I decided the problems I was having with it weren't worth it.  I'm back to 2.0.51.19, with 20-r1 package.masked for now, and after a sync, have motif-config-0.8 back again, so all is good! =8^)

Thanks for the quick response, in any case! =8^)
