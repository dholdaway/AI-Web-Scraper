Description

When texlive-music is build with doc USE, it doesn't install guitar.dtx needed by /usr/share/texmf-dist/doc/latex/guitar/guitar.tex.

It's include in texlive ISO in texmf-dist/source/latex/guitar/guitar.dtx

Also, should mxtx2mml be imported in tree ?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. cd /usr/share/texmf-dist/doc/latex/guitar/
2. pdflatex guitar.tex
3.

Actual Results:  
guitar.sty by M. Vaeth: Guitar chords over song texts 1.5
(/usr/share/texmf-dist/tex/latex/toolbox/toolbox.sty
toolbox.sty by M. Vaeth: The TeX Programmer's Toolbox 5.1
)) (./guitar.aux)

! LaTeX Error: File `guitar.dtx' not found.

yes, this file is installed with the source useflag

                                            ^^^^^^

I'm ok with that. But the doc file /usr/share/texmf-dist/doc/latex/guitar/guitar.tex is installed only with the doc USE flag, and it can't build without source USE flag. It make a inconstency.

What about for the rest ?

Unfortunately, yes. The bug is that guitar.tex should come with the source useflag; the "doc" and "source" useflags only reflect how upstream did split the packages in "main", "doc" and "source" categories.

Addition of packages? The ebuilds are only what was there when texlive 2008 was released. If you want more packages to be added you'll have better luck by posting at texlive's mailing list: see http://tug.org/texlive/lists.html
I didn't check, but maybe it's already in texlive 2009 and should come in the tree soon. If it's not, the other option is to add it as a 'dev-tex' package and make a specific ebuild for it.
