Amarok is no longer playing Last.fm streams for me. If I try, Amarok sits spinning its wheels for a while and after a few minutes says:

The source cannot be read for the URL: http://localhost:41548/lastfm.mp3
xine parameters: localhost

As said last night, the problem at the moment would have been last.fm being down (in which case, the freeze is due to xine-lib, and it freezes 30 seconds with 1.1.3, and indefinitely for 1.1.2... sometimes it actually stops, nothing I can do at the moment for that).

If there are other problems, please contact me on #amarok and I'll see better.
