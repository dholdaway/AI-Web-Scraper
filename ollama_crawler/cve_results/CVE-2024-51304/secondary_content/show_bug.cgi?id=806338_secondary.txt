as noted on another bug, you should fix this before reporting any more bugs:

[rospack] Warning: cannot create rospack cache directory /var/lib/portage/home/.ros: boost::filesystem::create_directory: Permission denied: "/var/lib/portage/home/.ros"
[rospack] Warning: cannot create rospack cache directory /var/lib/portage/home/.ros: boost::filesystem::create_directory: Permission denied: "/var/lib/portage/home/.ros"

permission for that directory looks to be fine:


~ $ ls -la /var/lib/portage/home/
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 1 portage portage 62 May 26 15:50 .
drwxr-sr-x 1 root    portage 96 Aug  4 22:56 ..
drwxr-xr-x 1 portage portage 34 May 12 05:54 .cache
-rw-r--r-- 1 root    root     0 May 26 15:50 .keep_acct-user_portage-0

indeed, but then why do you get those permission denied issues while I don't ?
