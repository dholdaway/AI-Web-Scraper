Hmm, very mystic...

this break comes from the vdr-plugin-2.eclass ONLY if media-video/vdr is NOT installed

i am not shure what goes here wrong :(
did you install media-video/vdr and did not use
ebuild bla-foo.ebuild install

on my local test
media-plugins/vdr-systeminfo pulls on DEPEND the media-video/vdr in the system as first and after this i don't have problems to compile install merge the plugin in the system

it is always help full when the bug opener give no feedback on requests

patrick, what is your suggestion?

Do we need a more expanded feedback in the vdr-plugin-2.eclass?
