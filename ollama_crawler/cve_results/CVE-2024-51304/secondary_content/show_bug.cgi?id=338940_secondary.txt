Sorry to say: I can not reproduce the problem here on 4 systems:

* stable amd64 chroot   - works
* unstable amd64 chroot - works
  (with gcc-4.50. and also with 4.5.1)
* two mostly stable x86 systems - works

The problem seen in the log reads as:
./verilog.g: In function ‘v_name_of_block’:
./verilog.g:1835:7: error: unexpected end of file after #line

But verilog.g is around 2045 lines here.

So can you please retest Diego.

Does the .g file get generated? Tinderbox is using gcc 4.5, gtk 2.22 and gmake 3.82 so there can be some issue with the configuration, but i have no idea where to start on this package unless you give me an idea.

No, it gets simple unpacked from the source. That is why I asked to simple retry and see if there was something wrong with unpacking.

Same problem here. No idea where to start as long as I can not observe the problem :-).

But thanks for the additional informations. I will just look deeper and ask some
others for further testing. 

Next step is to upgrade gtk+ and make to your version.

There's a pretty newer version of gtkwave available at upstream.

I'm planning to bump it tonight. Maybe the newer version fixes the bug.

I know and was about to do it myself in next days. But feel free to do so.

Btw, can you reproduce Diegos observation?

No, I tried to reproduce it with gcc 4.5.1/make 3.82 and can't reproduce it.

Same here. GCC 4.5.1/make 3.82/gtk+ 2.22, rebuild system, forced a reload of the packae from teh server and still no problems here.

I bumped gtkwave to 3.3.16 and removed some old versions, including this one.

I'm closing this bug because it apparently doesn't affect newer versions of gtkwave and we can't reproduce.
