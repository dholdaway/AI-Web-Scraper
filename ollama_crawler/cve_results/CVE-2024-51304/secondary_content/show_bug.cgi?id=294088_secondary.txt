Description

I would like to get my bugzilla email address changed to devurandom-gmx.net (s/-/@/). I do not seem to be allowed to make that change by myself.

Log in.
Click on "Prefs"
The first tab is 'account settings.'
Enter your current password, then enter a new address in the Email Address Field.

Bugzilla will send you a confirmation mail to the new address.

Done.

I made a test account (with no privs) and tested this procedure.

Thanks a lot for that information, I must have totally missed that field.
