emerge -uD world stopped at ruby-1.8.4:

!!! Security Violation: A file exists that is not in the manifest.
!!! File: files/digest-ruby-1.8.4.20060226

Is this a QC issue where someone forgot to add the file, or a compromised mirror?

I've got it listed in my manifest.  May be a mirror problem?

I sync'd up again and it was fine, but I ran into the same kind of issue with another package.  For now I'm just going to turn off the strict feature in portage.

Could this be related to the fact that I use sync with portage tarballs instead of the rsync method?

not sure, really, but this is probably more of a problem for the mirroring folks than for us ruby dudes.
