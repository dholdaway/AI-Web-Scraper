Although their expression and roles in endoderm-derived tissues and in the trigeminal ganglia have been investigated, their expression in the CNS has not been described yet.

Although their expression and roles in endoderm-derived tissues and in the trigeminal ganglia have been investigated, their expression in the CNS has not been described yet. In this study, we report a qualitative and quantitative expression profile of the OC factors in the developing spinal motor neurons (MN). We provide evidence that OC expression is initiated in newly-born MN. At later stages, they are differentially and dynamically expressed in subsets of differentiating motor neuron within the four motor columns. We also show that the expression profile of HNF-6 in spinal MN is conserved in chick embryos. Together, our data unveil a complex and dynamic expression profile of the OC proteins in spinal MN, which suggests that these factors may participate in regulatory networks that control different steps of motor neuron development.ElsevierShow moreShow lessSave Cite Cited by 69 Related articles All 10 versions  PrivacyTermsHelpAbout ScholarSearch help
