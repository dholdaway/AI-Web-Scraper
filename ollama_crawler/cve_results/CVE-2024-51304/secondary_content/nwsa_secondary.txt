Digital audiobooks revenue was larger than e-books revenue for the first time this quarter•REA Group posted exceptional results for the quarter, with revenues of $305 million, a 37% increase compared to the prior year, primarily driven by robust Australian residential performance and higher financial services revenue•At the Subscription Video Services segment, Foxtel Group saw strong streaming performance, with both Kayo and BINGE achieving record paying subscribers, and ended the fiscal year at over 3.2 million total paying streaming subscribers•Announced landmark multi-year global partnership with OpenAINEW YORK, NY – August 8, 2024 – News Corporation (“News Corp” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: NWS, NWSA; ASX: NWS, NWSLV) today reported financial results for the three months and fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. Commenting on the results, Chief Executive Robert Thomson said: “Fiscal 2024 was an outstanding year for News Corp, as we not only delivered robust earnings growth and created substantial shareholder value, but took a significant step to prepare the Company to prosper in the AI age.Our landmark agreement with OpenAI is not only expected to be lucrative, but will enable us to work closely with a trusted, pre-eminent partner to fashion a future for professional journalism and for provenance. Meanwhile, we have begun to take legal steps against AI aggressors, the egregious aggregators, who are predatory in the confiscation of our content. ‘Open source’ can never be a justification for ‘open slather.’For the quarter, revenues grew 6 percent to almost $2.6 billion, while net income improved significantly and profitability advanced by 11 percent to a fourth quarter record. Our core pillars of growth - Book Publishing, Digital Real Estate Services and Dow Jones - inspired the increasing profitability, and their strength augurs well for Fiscal 2025.We are confident in the Company’s long-term prospects and are continuing to review our portfolio with a focus on maximizing returns for shareholders. That review has coincided recently with third-party interest in a potential transaction involving the Foxtel Group, which has been positively transformed in recent years. We are evaluating options for the business with our advisors in light of that external interest.1The following information was filed by News Corp (NWSA) on Thursday, August 8, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.
