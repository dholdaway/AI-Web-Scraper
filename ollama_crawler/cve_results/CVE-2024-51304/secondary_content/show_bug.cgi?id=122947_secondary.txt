${S}/misc/romcheck/Makefile.in contains "-i-" instead of "-i" in the LINKFLAGS in the package my system downloaded. This is a syntax violation and bcc bombs with a usage message. Please consider this updated ebuild to fix the problem.

+ invalid herd in metadata.xml, apps in portage are maintainer-needed.
