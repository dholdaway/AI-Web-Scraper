very same problem like in this bug:
http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=119323

seems whatever i do, pango wont make pangocairo things.

--- /usr/lib/pkgconfig/
>>> /usr/lib/pkgconfig/pango.pc
>>> /usr/lib/pkgconfig/pangox.pc
>>> /usr/lib/pkgconfig/pangoxft.pc
>>> /usr/lib/pkgconfig/pangoft2.pc
--- /usr/bin/

Please use "New -> Gentoo Linux -> Component: Ebuilds" in future. Infrastructure is not the correct addressee.

If you try to emerge cairo and pango one after another, it wont work.

use that command(maybe twice) without breaking emerge. Then and only Then it makes pangocairo things.


emerge -av xft libpng cairo glib pango
