Description

The following line in java-1.5-fixer does not produce the desired result with sys-apps/sed-4.0.9 (instead of replacing space with newline, it replaces space with the letter "n") but it does work just fine with sys-apps/sed-4.1.5:

sed -e 'y/ /\n/' <<< ${broken_packages} | sort | uniq

People caught with old versions of sed (like me) will have a problem trying to run this command unless they realize they need to upgrade.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. use sys-apps/sed-4.0.9 (not sys-apps/sed-4.1.5)
2. run java-1.5-fixer (hopefully there will be some jar files requiring fixing)
3. breakage!

Actual Results:  
java-1.5-fixer prints:
 * Packages to fix this run:
=dev-java/xml-commons-external-1.3.02n=media-sound/jsynthlib-0.19_pre20041220n=sci-libs/libsvm-2.81


Expected Results:  
java-1.5-fixer should have printed:
 * Packages to fix this run:
=dev-java/xml-commons-external-1.3.02 =media-sound/jsynthlib-0.19_pre20041220 =sci-libs/libsvm-2.81

sys-apps/sed-4.0.9 has been removed half year ago; update your system properly using emerge -uD world instead. Thanks.
