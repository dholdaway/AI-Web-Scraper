Exhibit 99.1 
 
 
Liquidia Reports Fourth
Quarter and Full-Year 2019
Financial Results and Provides Corporate
Update
 
Submitted
New Drug Application (NDA) for LIQ861 in January 2020
Management to Host Webcast and Conference Call Today at 8:00 a.m. ET
 
RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, NC, March 11,
2020 – Liquidia Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: LQDA) (“Liquidia” or the “Company”), a late-stage
clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel products utilizing its proprietary
PRINT® technology, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2019, and provided
a corporate update.
 
“We are pleased to have submitted
our NDA for LIQ861, an important milestone in our continued evolution towards becoming a fully-integrated, commercial biopharmaceutical
company. We were also pleased to raise additional equity capital through a private placement and ATM sales during the fourth quarter.
We look forward to continuing to advance our pipeline based upon our PRINT technology to bring meaningful benefits to patients,”
stated Neal Fowler, Liquidia’s Chief Executive Officer.
 
Corporate Update
 

·Completed INSPIRE clinical trial and
submitted NDA for LIQ861
 
Based upon the favorable results
of the pivotal Phase 3 INSPIRE trial and pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers, the Company submitted an NDA for LIQ861
to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on January 24, 2020 under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. As previously reported,
the safety and tolerability profile of LIQ861, the primary endpoint of the INSPIRE trial, was observed to be favorable. Also, as
previously reported, a high rate of sustained treatment benefit across certain exploratory endpoints was observed, including the
maintenance or improvement of New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class in more than 90% of all patients enrolled in the
trial who completed two months of treatment. As recently reported at the 14th Annual Pulmonary Vascular Research Institute (PVRI)
Conference, results of a pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers have also demonstrated that treprostinil exposure from a 79.5
mcg dose of LIQ861 is comparable to that of nine breaths of Tyvaso, the reference listed drug.
 

·Continuing clinical studies to evaluate
long-term safety, tolerability and hemodynamic effects of LIQ861
 
Most patients from INSPIRE continue
to receive LIQ861 in the extension study, including several patients with at least 18 months of treatment. The safety and tolerability
profile of LIQ861 in this extension study remains consistent with the results seen in the INSPIRE trial. In addition, a clinical
study has been initiated in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension at certain investigational sites in Europe to characterize
the hemodynamic dose-response relationship to LIQ861.
