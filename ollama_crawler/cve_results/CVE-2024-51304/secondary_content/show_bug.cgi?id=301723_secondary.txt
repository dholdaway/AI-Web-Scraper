i am installing from from gentoo minimal CD. 
unpacking
stage3-amd64-20091231.tar.bz2
portage-latest.tar.bz2
and chrooting.
my next step was emerge gentoo-sources.
after make menuconfig i did make, and i got compile error.

so i tried stage3-amd64-20091203.tar.bz2
and there is no problem.
maybe is something broken in stage3-amd64-20091231.tar.bz2 ?

I'm not sure about correct solution but on russian forum this was discussed and reverting this patch: http://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/13814/ fixed the problem. Could you confirm?

This ticket needs to be reopened, the bug persists and is caused by the lines:
# revert to pre-gcc-4.4 behaviour of .eh_frame
KBUILD_CFLAGS        += $(call cc-option,-fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm)

in the Makefile. The flag being used there is only available to systems running gcc 4.4 or newer. 

Since at the moment x86 gentoo-sources implement these lines, while x86 gcc is still 4.3.x, no kernel compilation will work.

Reverting, as stated, will correct the behaviour.
