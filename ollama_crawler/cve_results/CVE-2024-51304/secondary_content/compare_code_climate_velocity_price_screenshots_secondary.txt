How is GitClear so price-competitive vs Code Climate?

Divergent customer acquisition philosophies. Traditional GitClear competitors (LinearB, Code Climate Velocity,
Pluralsight Flow, etc) price in a mandatory/dedicated
sales rep
"account manager," ostensibly on behalf of ensuring that customers are fully utilizing the product.


Code Climate uses a sales-driven customer acquisition funnel, which means they need to charge
considerably more to cover the salaries of a sales team.


GitClear also offers in-house experts via our Data Insights Program. The difference is
that our "dedicated support" program comes a la carte -- you are welcome to purchase it for a few months, and
then cancel it once you're up-to-speed on how the product works.







A few reasons customers choose GitClear







1. Flexible, product-driven pricing



A sales-driven company is more expensive than a product-driven company. This makes GitClear a more appealing
option for companies sensitive to annual costs.

2. Developer-powered vs. Manager-powered



GitClear bills itself as "the most developer-friendly analytics tool," and it requires that developers grant permission
to those who want to filter on their individual stats. No other Developer Analytics tool gives developers control
over who views their data.


Every developer has dealt with a Bad Manager at some point in their career, so the burden is on the tool to prove that those managers won't use it against the creators.
Several pages of Code Climate promote the comparison of individuals based on metrics of debatable value.






3. Pinpoint Tech Debt


Actionability of data matters. That's why GitClear helps pinpoint directories that have slowed down developers who dared wade into them.
Only GitClear allows you to utilize a substantiated metric to decide upon which directories to prioritize when you decide it's time to pick up the development pace.





4. Perfect for developer self-optimization


GitClear was originally built for developers that have a self-interest in improving: the developers in a startup.
Anyone in a small company understands how the business will live or die based on the rate at which code changes
can be deployed.

5. Empirically validated


Code Climate Velocity derives measurements by analyzing git's reporting of Lines of Code and Commit Count.
The data that can be gleaned from these sources is prone to bursts of noise.
GitClear's Diff Delta metric has been empirically proven to correlate better with code evolution than
Lines of Code or Commit Count.

5.5 Rapid setup, no process changes



To reap the full benefit of Code Climate Velocity requires training a team to participate in a specific regimen that allows the
software to generate data.


In contrast, GitClear was built to "Just Work‚Ñ¢Ô∏è". You log in, choose which repos to import,
optionally connect to Jira, and wait a few hours. No credit card or no sales demo necessary. Once you see
your data through GitClear, you'll realize why we grew more than 4x in 2021 alone.
