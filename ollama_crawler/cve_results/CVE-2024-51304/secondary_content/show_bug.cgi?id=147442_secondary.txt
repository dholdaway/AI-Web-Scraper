Description

User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier: 

At least the forum article listing uses hard formating of text, i.e. some of 
the text is hidden unless viewed at a very large display.  One has to scroll 
sidewards back and forth to read the whole article, which is very unconvenient.

Probably this IMHO bad style of HTML/XML coding can be found on other gentoo 
web pages, too.

Proposed fix:
An example of how to do it better is the gentoo bugtracking website.  Here the 
contents needs a minimal sized display of say 800x600 to be viewed w/o 
scrolling sidewards, but the contents enlarges when you resize your browser 
window.  This is still not optimal; consider the small displays of network 
enabled PDA or mobile phones.  But for the average equipment today it is fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open forums.gentoo.org
2. Choose any category and click a thread with many postings
3. Read all the articles
4. After ten minutes, observe the fingers that you use to hold and instruct 
your pointing device (mouse).  Do you feel pain?  Make a break.  No? Go on 
reading the thread until your hand and fingers hurt.

Actual Results:  
pain in the right hand and fingers and: headache... (HTML is about ten years 
old)

Expected Results:  
Provide _easy_ and _instant_ access to information with minimal effort (e.g. 
mouse or keyboard interaction).
"Information at you fingertips" w/o needing medical help after a week of 
visiting the site.

Note on the severity: IMHO this is not a cosmetic bug, nor is it minor (there 
is no easy workaround for the user)

I'm not quite sure i can follow, could you provide a screenshot?
Furthermore i assume that may be an upstream problem unless it has something to do with our patches, does it also happen on other phpBB forums?

I checked forum posts and the size of the actual text was 272 pixels wide.

The width of thread lists was 147 pixels.

Forum lists appear to be a similar length.

If you encounter further issues with excessively wide content, please reopen *including a URL*.
