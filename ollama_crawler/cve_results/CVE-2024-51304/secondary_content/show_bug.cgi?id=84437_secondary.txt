xchat crashes when connecting to a server when the systray plugin is present.. it did not do that with the previous stable version of xchat.. probably should p.mask the plugin or find a patch... its really annoying.. took me a while to find out where the problem came from

[I--] [  ] net-irc/xchat-2.4.1-r1 (2)
[I--] [  ] net-irc/xchat-systray-2.4.5-r1 (0)

and I don't get a crash when connecting. Do you have some more information, like a backtrace?

Created attachment 52886 [details]
systray.conf that crashes..

for some reason gdb refuses to work with xchat-2 ... it tries to access memory
at 0x10670 .. 
and I get
warning: Unable to find dynamic linker breakpoint function.
GDB will be unable to debug shared library initializers
and track explicitly loaded dynamic code.

And gdb works with other apps btw.. 
I can give you a strace output.. but wont help much.. all it says is that it
crashes after having connected to a server.

But I managed to find that if I change some config in systray.conf it stops..
not sure which.. I attached my systray.conf .. I guess it will be pretty easy
to diagnose if gdb works..

Just moved your systray.conf over my .xchat2/systray.conf and it still doesn't crash.

Sorry, I'm unable to reproduce this.
