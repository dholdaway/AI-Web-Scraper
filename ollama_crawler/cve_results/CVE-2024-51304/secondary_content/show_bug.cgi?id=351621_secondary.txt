Hi, if i enable pulseaudio flag for wine , it will download a patch from external source , and it's now dead , took me 20 minutes to search for a useable one , it's here.

Reproducible: Always

This patch is just 2.6KB , it should be stored just in an external source , please put it directly into portage tree , thanks.

the server is temporarily dead.  if your system had proper gentoo mirrors listed in the make.conf, this wouldnt be a problem.
