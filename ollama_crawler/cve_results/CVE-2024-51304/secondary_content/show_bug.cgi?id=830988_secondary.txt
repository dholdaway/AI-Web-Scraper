Error(s) that match a know pattern in addition to what has been reported in the summary:


-- Could NOT find VulkanRegistry (missing: VulkanRegistry_DIR) 
/var/tmp/portage/media-libs/vulkan-layers-1.2.198-r1/work/Vulkan-ValidationLayers-sdk-1.2.198.0/layers/subresource_adapter.h:67:5: error: definition of implicit copy assignment operator for 'Subresource' is deprecated because it has a user-declared copy constructor [-Werror,-Wdeprecated-copy]

I only see this today with 1.3.216:

> cc1: error: command-line option ‘-Wdeprecated-copy’ is valid for C++/ObjC++ but not for C [-Werror]
> cc1: all warnings being treated as errors
