Basically, the package.mask on hal/dbus/etc breaks gnome upgrades since
gnome-vfs-2.11.92 requires hal >= 0.5... this wouldn't be such an issue, but
gnome-vfs-2.11.92 is *not* masked and hal >= 0.5 *is* masked.

Calculating world dependencies |
!!! All ebuilds that could satisfy ">=sys-apps/hal-0.5" have been masked.
!!! One of the following masked packages is required to complete your request:
- sys-apps/hal-0.5.2 (masked by: package.mask)
# Doug Goldstein <cardoe@gentoo.org> (18 August 2005)
# Masking 0.5.x of HAL & 0.3x of DBUS since they break API
# Added here for Gnome purposes, pmount deps on this stuff


For more information, see MASKED PACKAGES section in the emerge man page or
section 2.2 "Software Availability" in the Gentoo Handbook.
!!!    (dependency required by "gnome-base/gnome-vfs-2.11.92" [ebuild])

>=gnome-base/gnome-vfs-2.11 is listed in package.mask. It was added on 8/14 as
shown here:
http://www.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/profiles/package.mask?rev=1.4274&view=markup

This seems like a local problem. Maybe you have some old entries in
package.unmask causing this package to upgrade.
