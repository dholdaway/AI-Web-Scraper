Issue: dev-perl/CHI-0.600.0-r1 fails tests (lto).
Discovered on: amd64 (internal ref: lto_tinderbox)

NOTE:
This machine uses lto with CFLAGS=-flto -Werror=odr -Werror=lto-type-mismatch -Werror=strict-aliasing

Here is a bit of explanation:

-Werror=lto-type-mismatch:
User to find possible runtime issues in packages. It likely means the package is unsafe to build & use with LTO.
For projects using the same identifier but with different types across different files, they must be fixed to be consistent across the codebase.

-Werror=odr:
Used to find possible runtime issues in packages. These bugs are a problem anyway but may be even worse when combined with LTO. C++ code must comply with the One Definition Rule (ODR) - see https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/definition#One_Definition_Rule.

-Werror=strict-aliasing:
Used to find possible runtime issues in packages. These bugs are a problem anyway but may be even worse when combined with LTO.

Workarounds:
- If upstream is friendly and still active, file a bug upstream. For emulators, codecs, games, or multimedia packages, it may be worth just applying a workaround instead, as upstreams sometimes aren't receptive to these bugs (VALID FOR ALL).
- Use the new 'filter-lto' from flag-o-matic.eclass as it's likely to be unsafe with LTO (VALID FOR lto-type-mismatch - odr).
- Fix it yourself if interested, of course (VALID FOR ALL).
- Append-flags -fno-strict-aliasing (VALID FOR strict-aliasing).
- Use memcpy() but a union is sometimes suitable too (VALID FOR strict-aliasing).
- -fstrict-aliasing is implied by -O2, so this must be addressed in some form (VALID FOR strict-aliasing).

===(     345;1  126/?  114/? )==========================================# 40 is not between 59 and 99

#   Failed test 'Memory:l1_cache size = 40'
#   at /var/tmp/portage/dev-perl/CHI-0.600.0-r1/work/CHI-0.60/blib/lib/CHI/t/Driver.pm line 1555.
#   (in CHI::t::Driver::Memory->test_size_awareness_with_subcaches)
# 2 is not between 3 and 5

#   Failed test 'Memory:l1_cache keys = 2'
#   at /var/tmp/portage/dev-perl/CHI-0.600.0-r1/work/CHI-0.60/blib/lib/CHI/t/Driver.pm line 1557.
#   (in CHI::t::Driver::Memory->test_size_awareness_with_subcaches)
# Looks like you failed 2 tests of 875.
t/Driver-Memory.t ..... Dubious, test returned 2 (wstat 512, 0x200)     
Failed 2/875 subtests 
	(less 1 skipped subtest: 872 okay)





But I cannot reproduce the test failure at all (with 0.610.0). Moreover, this package doesn't build any compiled code so it clearly cannot have anything to do with LTO.
