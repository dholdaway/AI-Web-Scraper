Well sorry, but you did cut off all the important info.

Do the same for libICE.

OK, what I did:
emerge libXt => fails
emerge libSM => fails
emerge -e xorg-x11 did it! But I don't know why ;-)

Soo now emerging libICE didn't made any difficulties. I should have made this before "emerge -e xorg-x11".

Good to hear that it's fixed.  Still not sure what's causing this...

Alternatively, you may set the environment variables XT_CFLAGS

This appears to just be a problem with the dependency graph portage builds.  When I emerged libXt directly without packages that depend on libXt it got all the dependencies in the right order and compiled fine.

The errors and log above (in my previous post) were during a fresh AMD64 install.

I'd suggest either reopening the bug or making a new one, but with my past experiences here I'm guessing the consensus will just be that users are smart enough to figure out what dependencies are missing and emerge them themselves.

I think so ;)

This is a semi-known problem, and there are some Portage patches that are supposed to alleviate some cases of this problem.  However, it appears that sometimes packages don't install all their files.  This headache should only happen once, since we're sticking with modular after this point.
