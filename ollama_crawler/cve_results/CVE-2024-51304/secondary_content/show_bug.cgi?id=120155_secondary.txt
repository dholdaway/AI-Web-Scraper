On opening the 'Run Application' dialog via shortcut gnome-panel dies on almost half the times (no pattern found): "The Application "gnome-panel" has quit unexpectedly."
I think this happens since updating to gnome-panel-2.12.2.

by shortcut, do you mean alt+f2?

this works fine here.

have you done a revdep-rebuild lately?

Don't remember the original shortcut, changed it to ctrl+space.

Just did a revdep-rebuild, no gnome package has been mentioned in the output.
Going back to 2.12.1 didn't help.

I have same problem after last system update:
Menu item "Run application" removed from "Application" menu. But I can to start it when I press Alt-F2.
revdep-rebuild do not help me.

by default, run application is removed from the menu for 2.12.

@Sergey: does your panel crash when doing Alt+F2 to bring up the run application? ( or another key combination you set it to ) or are you just saying its removed from the menu?

Thanks

Seems gnome-panel dies each second time I bring up the 'Run Application' dialog, except for the first 2 times after booting.

When gnome-panel dies, try to launch a gnome-terminal, for example, an execute "gnome-panel". Later, try to reproduce the bug and post the error here.

Thanks :)

Good idea. But gnome-panel automaticaly restarts. Brings up the dialog Restart or Cancel, but after Cancel it restarts anyway (on Restart you will get an endless row of "already running" messages).
I looked, but couldn't find an option to turn this off (via gconf).

you can stop it from restarting in gnome-session-properties -> current session tab .

It looks like I can't trigger the bug after changing gnome-panel from Restart to Normal in the Sessions dialog. In other words, the panel only dies with Restart style.

It seems the problem disappeared thanks to a recent update (don't know when and what exactly)

3 years and 6 gnome releases later... Please open a new bug report with versions of the involved applications and basic informations such as emerge --info and the backtrace of the problem.
