Analyze this sequence






Run BLAST
Find regions of similarity between this sequence and other sequences
                    using BLAST.


Pick Primers
Design and test primers for this sequence using
                            Primer-BLAST.


Highlight Sequence Features
Opens the Highlight Feature Bar and highlights feature annotations
                        from the FEATURES table of the record. The Highlight Feature Bar can be used
                        to navigate to and highlight other features and provides links to display
                        the highlighted region separately. Links in the FEATURES table will also
                        highlight the corresponding region of the sequence. More...


Find in this Sequence
Finds sub-sequences or patterns in the sequence and highlights the
                        matching regions. The tool works with standard single letter nucleotide or
                        protein codes including ambiguities and can match Prosite patterns in
                        protein sequences. More...
