failed to load "./apple-red.png": Couldn't recognize the image file format for file './apple-red.png'

emerge -e gtk+-2.24.5-r1 don't solve the problem.

Build.log for gtk+-2.24.5-r1

The Build log was too big to post it as plain text.

I found a solution. 
because "emerge -e gtk+ aren't solving the soloution I tried to rebuild some other packages. 
After rebuilding x11-libs/cairo-1.10.2-r1 i can compile x11-libs/gtk+-2.24.5-r1

It's very strange why i have to rebuild cairo.  emerge -e gtk+ are building cairo. 

for me you can close this bug .. or you may find out why I have to rebuild cairo.


Thx. for your work

As I cannot reproduce the problem and looks like no duplicates appear, closing then

Thanks for feedback :)
