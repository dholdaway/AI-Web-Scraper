Description


Christian Hofrichter





          2007-09-03 10:38:39 UTC
        

Running /etc/init.d/xdm in the default runnel during boot up with baselayout-2 causes:
/usr/kde/3.5/bin/kdm died
/etc/init.d/xdm[4479]: ERROR: could not start the Display Manager

After the error boot continues and kde is started normally. (Auto Login)
Kdm seems still be running though:

>ps -e | grep -i kdm
 4475 ?        00:00:00 kdm
 4567 ?        00:00:00 kdm

>cat /var/run/kdm.pid
4475

Error is seen only during boot up. Manually starting the service later after boot causes no errors.
Happens with baselayout-2.0.0-rc3 and rc4. Xinit version 1.0.3-r3

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. starting /etc/init.d/xdm in the default runlevel with baselayout-2
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
error reported though kdm seems started

Upgrade your xinit to -r4 or newer
