 Inside Becton Dickinson Co's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
The Medical segment's higher gross profit margin in 2022 compared with 2021 primarily reflected the following: Favorable product mix with higher sales of high value-added products in the Medication Delivery Systems and Medication Management Solutions units.



 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Strong growth in global placements of the Medication Management Solutions unit's dispensing systems, partially offset by an unfavorable comparison to revenues in 2021, which benefited from pandemic-related demand for infusion pumps and sets.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
The Interventional segment's higher gross profit margin in 2022 compared with 2021 primarily reflected favorable impacts from price, favorable product mix and foreign currency translation, which were partially offset by higher freight costs.

 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
Cash flows from continuing operating activities in 2021 reflected higher net income, which was driven by strong revenue performance, adjusted by a change in operating assets and liabilities that was a net source of cash.

 Other - Other   Highlight
BD's effective tax rate in any given period could be impacted if, upon resolution with taxing authorities, we prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established, or we were required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves.
