Hi,
  for some reasons, the Gentoo BSD-2 file does not match the http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause file. Should they be same or not?

Thank you

I see only a difference of one word: In the second sentence of the disclaimer, our version says "COPYRIGHT OWNER" whereas the version at opensource.org says "COPYRIGHT HOLDER". 

The FSF even identifies the 2-clause BSD license with the FreeBSD license. The text of their version says "FREEBSD PROJECT" instead of the above.
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html#FreeBSD

So I don't think that we have any problem there.

Hi Ulrich,
  thank you for your analysis. I am scratching my head what I really wanted to report here. I think I saw more differences while writing the bugreport but maybe I was fooled by the line-wrapping in the re-shuffled diff output. At the moment I also only see the following difference, as you said:

--- /usr/portage/licenses/BSD-2  2012-12-14 20:17:49.000000000 +0100
+++ /tmp/BSD-2-Clause   2015-02-28 10:44:47.150154732 +0100
-ARE DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT OWNER OR CONTRIBUTORS BE
+ARE DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTORS BE

I am sorry for the noise.



BTW: Is there any common source of the plaintex-formatted LICENSE files so that one could just rely on diff command and require an identical match? It is suboptimal to copy&paste a LICENSE text from the http://opensource.org/licenses website (without line wrappings) and compare with plaintext files, mostly line-wrapped, in Gentoo.

I'm only aware of the collections at opensource.org and spdx.org which are without line wrappings. Generally, I more often use wdiff (possibly with the -3 option) for comparing license texts than plain diff.
