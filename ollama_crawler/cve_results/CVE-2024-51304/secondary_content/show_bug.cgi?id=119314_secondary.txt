hello,
I just wanted to offer a suggestion pertaining to the split ebuilds in the installation of the KDE window manager.

I'm a KDE user, although I didn't come by this decision lightly, after using varied distributions of linux and finding I liked it best. What helped me to decide as a then n00b linux user is having "everything" there for me to explore and get a good idea of what linux has to offer. Basically what I'm saying is that you should always allow for a meta build of KDE components simply if anything else so a new linux user discovring linux for the first time can also see "everything" that linux has to offer. If anything else you can also think of us lazy lusers who would want to update with just emerging one package. I also on the other hand like the option of updating what I feel like instead of everything. Either ways there's my two cents...I appreciate your time.

You mean like "emerge kde" ?

yeah, something like that, or emerge kde-meta but still allowing for the option to install individual packages for those that would prefer the split ebuilds.

Right, but "emerge kde" and "emerge kde-meta" work now and do what you suggest, so I'm confused at what you're wanting.

then it appears that you have not read the info about future plans on kde split ebuilds (try the split ebuilds how to document) which states that meta ebuilds may no longer be available after kde 3.x (such as when kde 4.x comes out). What I'm wanting, to make it absolutely clear, is for kde meta ebuilds to always be available in further releases after 3.x rather than completely phased out and unavailable once kde moves on to the 4.0 and above series.

It does?

From what I read, it says that the monolithic ones may be moved away, but the meta ebuilds encompassing the whole kde set will still be available.

Either way though, it's a bit early to speculate since we don't even know what KDE 4.x will look like.  They may completely change the structure.

There will always be a way to install all of KDE, be it "emerge kde" or "emerge kde-meta", which do the same thing.  I think you may just be confused on the difference between monolithic and -meta.

I think what was requested in this Bug is there and the plan is to always provide such a feature, even if the monolitic ebuilds are not provided any more. Therefore closing this Bug for now, please reopen if you still think that there is something missing!
