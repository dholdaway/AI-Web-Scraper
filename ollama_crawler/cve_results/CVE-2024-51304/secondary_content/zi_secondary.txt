 Inside Zoominfo Technologies Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Income   Highlight
Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our Provision (Benefit) for income taxes in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results.



 Legal - Other   Highlight
However, if such claims arise in the future, they could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.

 Financial - Debt   Highlight
Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of substantially all of our debt.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
Subsequent to the measurement period, changes to uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances will be recorded to earnings.

 M & A - Other   Highlight
As part of our business strategy, we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses from time to time; however, we cannot predict the magnitude or frequency of such acquisitions or investments.
