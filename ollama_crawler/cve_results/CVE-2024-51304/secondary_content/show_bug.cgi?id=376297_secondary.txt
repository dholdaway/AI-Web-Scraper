Description

While attempting to update my system, the emerge failed to build gobject-introspection. I tried a revdep-rebuild only to discover that gobject-introspection was the first package to be installed. After doing some reading online I followed suggestions to use "lafilefixer --justfixit" to no avail. I also emerged cairo again. Upon trying an emerge --sync a day later to see if any issues were fixed, the problem persisted. As a last resort, I downgraded cairo to 1.8.10 and found that gobject-introspection will install with 1.8.10. Having found an older version that enables gobject-introspection to install, I suspect that gobject-introspection needs a fix to work with the newer version of cairo, or a change between cairo-1.9.10 and 1.10.2-r1 is to blame.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Emerge x11-libs/cairo-1.10.2-1
2. Emerge dev-libs/gobject-introspection-0.10.8
Actual Results:  
Build failed to complete

Expected Results:  
gobject-introspection should have installed

Any plans of attaching the build log of the failure ?

I apologize for the delay. In order to produce a build log, I attempted to emerge the packages again. x11-libs/cairo-1.10.2-r1 succeeded as an upgrade. However emerging gobject-introspection also succeeded. I'm not sure why the downgrade and upgrade of cairo fixed this when a straight reinstall of cairo did not. Nevertheless, I cannot reproduce this again myself.
