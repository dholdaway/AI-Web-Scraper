FIRST FINANCIAL BANKSHARES ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER 2023 EARNINGS RESULTS
 
ABILENE, Texas, January 25, 2024 - First Financial Bankshares, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) (NASDAQ: FFIN) today reported earnings of $45.98 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to earnings of $58.67 million for the same quarter a year ago. Basic and diluted earnings per share were $0.32 for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with $0.41 for the same quarter a year ago.
 
“2023 was a very challenging year for the banking industry due to the Federal Reserve’s highest and most rapid increase in interest rates in our country’s history. Despite the decline in our year-over-year net income in 2023, I am proud of the many accomplishments we achieved during the year and we continued to outperform our peer group of banks,” said F. Scott Dueser, Chairman, President and CEO of First Financial Bankshares, Inc. “We are pleased that we ended 2023 having maintained our total deposit levels when compared to 2022 year-end balances primarily resulting from the addition of over 12,500 net new accounts. Additionally, we grew loans organically $706.92 million, or 10.97 percent, during the year while maintaining our conservative credit standards. In addition, we took advantage of opportunities to restructure our balance sheet by selling $411.13 million in securities with lower yields and redeployed those dollars into our higher earning loan portfolio. The cash flows provided from the sales of securities combined with the monthly maturities in our bond and loan portfolios are providing us with the needed liquidity to grow loans which will also benefit our interest income as we go forward. Entering 2024, I believe we are well positioned for success in the economic environment. We appreciate the continued support of our customers, shareholders and associates.” Mr. Dueser added.
 
As further described below, the results this quarter when compared to the same quarter a year ago included (i) a $6.53 million decrease in net interest income, (ii) a $964 thousand decrease in mortgage revenues, (iii) a $6.34 million loss on sale of securities, (iv) a $2.08 million increase in FDIC insurance premiums, which includes a $1.75 million special assessment, and (v) a $1.51 million increase in incentive and profit sharing expenses.
 
Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2023, totaled $198.98 million compared to $234.48 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Basic and diluted earnings per share were $1.39 for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared with basic and diluted earnings per share of $1.64 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Included in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2023, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, were (i) a decrease of $17.61 million in net interest income, (ii) a decrease in debit card revenues of $8.56 million, (iii) a decrease in mortgage revenues of $7.15 million, (iv) a $9.26 million decline in gains on sales of securities, and (v) an increase of $4.04 million in FDIC insurance premiums, which includes a $1.75 million special assessment. Offsetting these reductions to earnings were (i) a decline of $6.80 million in the provision for credit losses and (ii) a decline of $5.30 million in incentive and profit sharing expenses.
 
Net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $97.51 million compared to $94.15 million for the third quarter of 2023 and $104.04 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The net interest margin, on a taxable equivalent basis, was 3.33 percent for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to 3.22 percent for the third quarter of 2023, and 3.47 percent for the fourth quarter of 2022. Average interest-earning assets were $11.93 billion for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $12.32 billion for the same quarter a year ago.
 
The Company did not record a provision for credit losses for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to a provision for credit losses of $4.08 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. At December31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses totaled $88.73 million, or 1.24 percent of loans held-for-investment (“loans” hereafter), compared to $75.83

 Inside First Financial Bankshares Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
The banking agencies could require additions to our allowance for credit losses based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examinations of our bank subsidiary.



 Financial - Income   Highlight
A downturn in the economy or lower employment could result in increased levels of nonaccrual, past due 90 days or more and still accruing, foreclosed assets, charge-offs, increased provision for credit losses and reductions in income.

 Other - Other   Highlight
The allowance for credit losses is the amount we determine as of a specific date to be appropriate to absorb current expected credit losses on existing loans.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Since these correlations are based on competitive and market conditions, we anticipate that our future results will likely be different from the foregoing estimates, and such differences could be material.

 Other - Other   Highlight
As of December 31, 2023, an increase of 100 basis points in the 5-year U.S. Treasury rate would result in an increase to unrealized losses by approximately $225 million before taxes, while a 100 basis point decrease in the same rate would result in a decrease to unrealized losses by approximately $198 million before taxes.
