Add linuxbios patches to qemu and other requisits for Linuxbios support.


Per http://www.linuxbios.org/index.php/QEMU_Build_Tutorial

---snip---
$ patch -p1 <qemu-linuxbios.patch
$ patch -p1 <qemu-piix-ram-size.patch

Use the --cc option if your default gcc is newer than version 3.2
---snip---

(The above patches might be provided in the next release of Qemu.)


Also, a new USE flag called "linuxbios" might be appropriate for required linuxbios cflags and patches.


Once I get an qemu ebuild hacked, I'll post it here.


The overall goal of this is to provided a linuxbios user/developer the tools and the ability to easily create a linuxbios to emulate with Qemu.

I haven't been working on linuxbios for awhile now and especially not with Qemu.

I still think this would be a great feature for Qemu/VirtualBox, but I don't have the time to work on it.  With any luck, it's probably a feature already included into Qemu.

(Marking as WORKSFORME.)
