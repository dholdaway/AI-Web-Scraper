Description

          2006-05-13 18:12:50 UTC
        

If I open up the deskbar prefs and try to change the Layout to "Button in panel", I get two successive dialogs saying that "A programming error has been detected", with the following details:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/deskbar/DeskbarApplet.py", line 68, in <lambda>
    deskbar.GCONF_CLIENT.notify_add (self.prefs.GCONF_UI_NAME, lambda x, y, z, a: self.on_ui_changed (z.value))
  File "/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/deskbar/DeskbarApplet.py", line 305, in on_ui_changed
    self.ui = CuemiacUI (self.applet, self.prefs)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/deskbar/ui/cuemiac/Cuemiac.py", line 656, in __init__
    self.on_change_background()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/deskbar/ui/cuemiac/Cuemiac.py", line 659, in on_change_background
    pixmap = self.applet.get_background()
AttributeError: 'gnome.applet.Applet' object has no attribute 'get_background'


The deskbar then disappears.  When I switch it back to "Entry in panel", the same dialog pops up again, but with no details, multiple times, and the deskbar comes back.  If I keep switching between the two layouts, I will get increasing numbers of the dialogs when switching back to entry in panel.

Reopen with exact ebuild name and version, I won't guess.

gnome-extra/deskbar-applet-2.14.1.1 - I wasn't sure whether the applet had its own ebuild, which apparently it does.

Happens to me with gnome-extras/deskbar-applet-2.14.2

"
checking for gnomeapplet module... X11 connection rejected because of wrong authentication.
no
configure: error: gnomeapplet module required to build deskbar
"

using "ssh -XY root@::1" to become root, if i disable the Xforwarding it works like a charm, would seem to be a bug to me, i finaly decided to posta bug after running into about 6 or so that need this.

I can no longer reproduce this, and I'm still on 2.14.1.1
