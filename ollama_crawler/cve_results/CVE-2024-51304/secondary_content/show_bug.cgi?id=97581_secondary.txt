Quoting from gentoo-dev thread:

I see now that in my case, emerge aborted on die() due to a side effect:
beta kchmviewer # emerge konqueror -pv

These are the packages that I would merge, in order:

Calculating dependencies   waiting for lock 
on /dev/shm/aux_db_key_temp.portage_lockfile

!!! ERROR: kde-base/konqueror-3.4.1 failed.
!!! Function deprange-list, Line 426, Exitcode 0
!!! deprange(): unsupported parameters 1 2 - BASEVER must be identical
!!! If you need support, post the topmost build error, NOT this status 
message.

 -

!!! Problem in kde-base/konqueror dependencies.
!!! too many values to unpack exceptions
^^^ Portage died due to a really bad DEPEND, but we can't count on that. So we
need to set a variable DEPEND_ERROR=<text> in deprange(), and see it and abort
in eg kde.eclass. Same applies to qt.eclass qt_min_version.
