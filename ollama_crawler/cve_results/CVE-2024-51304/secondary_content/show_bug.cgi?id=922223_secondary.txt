Please disregard. I was able to get over this issue by deleting the /boot/*.old files. Apparently, crap there due to having run out of disk space while building a new kernel led to junk files that eclean-kernel was not capable of handling.

It would be nice if tools like eclean-kernel gave better debug output and failed gracefully, but perhaps too much to expect from a Python script.
