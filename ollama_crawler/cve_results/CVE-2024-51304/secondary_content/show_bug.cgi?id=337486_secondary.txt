this patch is wrong. We (at least until now) don't do half-git/half-tree compatible ebuilds. We make use of gnome2 and gnome2-live eclasses for live ebuilds and your patch drops them for worse solutions (like not using eautoreconf).

and please provide a trace of your problem, I just run the unpack from an up to date overlay and it just works.
