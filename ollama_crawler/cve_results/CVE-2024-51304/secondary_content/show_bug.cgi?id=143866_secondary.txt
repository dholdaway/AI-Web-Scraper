Description


Julien Blanc

Context: fresh install of kmldonkey, client only (core doesnt't run on same machine).
Version : 0.10.1

After install and launch of kmldonkey, it is impossible to open the "connection settings" option (the menu never opens the box nor an error message), making it impossible to connect to a remote core.

this appear to be due to a missing configuration file
~/.kde/share/config/mldonkeyrc

(creating the file with following default values will solve this issue).

[MLDonkey]
BinaryPath=
Default=true
DonkeyGuiPort=4001
DonkeyHTTPPort=4080
DonkeyHost=192.168.0.1
DonkeyPassword=
DonkeyUsername=admin
HostMode=0
RootPath=
StartupMode=0

Works just fine for me as is on both KDE 3.5.5 and 3.5.6. Fully stable/unstable systems each.

If this is still a problem for you, please post your "emerge --info" as well as "emerge -pv =net-p2p/kmldonkey-0.10.1".
