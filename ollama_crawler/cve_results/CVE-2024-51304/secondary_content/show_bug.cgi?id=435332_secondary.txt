I filed bug report 435300 earlier today, regarding a net-misc/tigervnc build failure. It was marked as a duplicate of bug 435272. I wouldn't have wasted both my and your time by filing the report if I had known that the bug was already known.

The problem is that I tried to look to see if the problem was known already by searching for "tigervnc". This search finds neither of the two bug reports mentioned above. I would have expected the search to find a match by the name of the package.

The search feature is documented (in the toolbar the ?; on the front page 'Quick Search help'). The documentation [1] contains:

"By default, only open bugs are searched. If you want to know how to also search closed bugs, see the Advanced Shortcuts section."

Both of the bugs you are quoting are closed. As such, things work as intended.
