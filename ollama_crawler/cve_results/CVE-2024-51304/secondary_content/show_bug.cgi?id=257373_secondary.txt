I have seen this bug here - but i dont have trash in /usr/local.
Hope i filled out the form right - my first bug report.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.emerge xorg-x11

Actual Results:  
* Messages for package media-libs/mesa-6.5.2-r1:

 * 
 * ERROR: media-libs/mesa-6.5.2-r1 failed.
 * Call stack:
 *               ebuild.sh, line   49:  Called src_compile
 *             environment, line 2461:  Called die
 * The specific snippet of code:
 *       emake -j1 ${CONFIG} || die "Build failed"
 *  The die message:
 *   Build failed
 * 
 * If you need support, post the topmost build error, and the call stack if relevant.
 * A complete build log is located at '/var/tmp/portage/media-libs/mesa-6.5.2-r1/temp/build.log'.
 * The ebuild environment file is located at '/var/tmp/portage/media-libs/mesa-6.5.2-r1/temp/environment'.
 * 

Expected Results:  
nothing ;)

I have to say that i added xf86-video-intel,libdrm and gentoo-sources to package.keywords - so it compiles intel 2.5.1 and kernel 2.6.28-r1.
