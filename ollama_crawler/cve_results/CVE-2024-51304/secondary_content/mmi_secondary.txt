 MARCUS & MILLICHAP, INC. REPORTS RESULTS FOR FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2023 CALABASAS, Calif., February 16, 2024 -- (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Marcus & Millichap, Inc. (the “Company”, “Marcus & Millichap”, or “MMI”) (NYSE: MMI), a leading national brokerage firm specializing in commercial real estate investment sales, financing, research and advisory services, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and the year ended December 31, 2023.

We believe the eventual Fed shift, coupled with growing evidence of an economic soft landing will become catalysts to an increase in transactions and release of pent-up demand held by investors waiting for clarity. With record capital on the sideline, as values adjust we are seeing more buyer activity and offers on well-priced inventory we are bringing to market. MMI’s branding, talent acquisition and platform enhancements are positioning us well to lead in the eventual market recovery. In the interim, our focus remains on maintaining a strong balance sheet, fostering client relationships and strengthening the business for the long term.”Page 1The following information was filed by Marcus Millichap, Inc.

 Inside Marcus Millichap, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Debt   Highlight
That in turn could lead to modest declines in debt capital interest rates, which could support increased commercial real estate transaction activity.



 Other - Other   Highlight
This historical trend can be disrupted both positively and negatively by major economic events, political events, natural disasters or pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which may impact, among other things, investor sentiment for a particular property type or location, volatility in financial markets, current and future projections of interest rates, attractiveness of other asset classes, market liquidity, and the extent of limitations or availability of capital allocations for larger property buyers, among others.

 Other - Other   Highlight
We made an accounting policy election to not measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivable.

 Financial - Shares   Highlight
Movements of interest rates in one direction, whether increasing or decreasing, could adversely or positively affect the operations and income potential of commercial real estate properties, as well as lender and equity underwriting for real estate investments.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Although the fundamentals of most property types remain sound, both lending and investor activity remain below the pre-pandemic norm and the expectation gap between buyers and sellers remains wide.
