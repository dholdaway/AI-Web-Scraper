adobe-flash-11.2.202.425 contains a regression and does not work with http://join.me.  When viewing a screenshare, the entire screen blinks at a high speed.  I have verified that this was not an issue under adobe-flash-11.2.202.424.

Reproducible: Always

It was with firefox 34.0.5-r1 but it appears I cannot reproduce this bug anymore.  Perhaps something was quirky with my machine or join.me fixed whatever problem there was since I filed a bug with them as well yesterday.
