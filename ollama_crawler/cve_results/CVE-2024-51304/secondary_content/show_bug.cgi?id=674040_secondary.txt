Gerbera has support for libexif (exif) and exiv2 for extracting exif information.

I'm not convinced it is the best solution - user not building with exiv2 means they get effectively 'less' exif support, e.g. losing xmp support, but it extends to more than just the xmp functionality. Not losing more time over it though...
