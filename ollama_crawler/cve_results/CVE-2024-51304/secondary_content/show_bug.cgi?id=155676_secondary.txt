Description


Brian Davis

Current ebuilds for bind have a very convenient config script to configure bind to run in a chroot. This bug requests this functionality in apache ebuilds.

The beginning of a ebuild config script can be found here:
http://www.genco.gen.tc/gentoo_chroot_apache2.html

However, it's quite outdated and there are a few bugs in this script which could be corrected.
