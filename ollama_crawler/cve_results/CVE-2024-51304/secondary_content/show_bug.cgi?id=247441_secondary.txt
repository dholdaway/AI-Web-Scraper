This is per design and not any bug. PHP5-specific stuff (that in dev-php5) has always installed to /usr/share/php5 to avoid collisions with PHP4 - see the relevant eclasses. And yes, it requires proper settings on your side.

I will bring this up with the PHP team.

There two probable solutions to this:

(1) include /usr/share/php5 in the include path by default
(2) move everything to /usr/share/php

With php4 gone and php6 not in sight, (2) could be done but requires reworking a very complex set of eclasses (and will require another rework when php6 rolls around). So maybe (1) is the better way to go.

The php team has decided to not do (2), so that leaves us with (1). I've added this to https://overlays.gentoo.org/proj/php/wiki/TodoList so we don't forget.

In the meantime, please modify your include path and add the php5 directory.
Leaving the bug open until we decide on adding this to the default include path.

Well, olemarkus just noticed me /usr/share/php5 IS included in the default include path. So no action needed. Please update your php.ini, it should be there.
