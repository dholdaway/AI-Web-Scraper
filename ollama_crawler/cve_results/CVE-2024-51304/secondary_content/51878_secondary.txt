Previously we only provided a method to set the ignored schema cache tables, but there was no way to ask if a table was ignored by the schema cache. Applications may want to implement their own schema cache, or at least run this check. Rather than forcing them to implement an internal method, this adds a way to ask whether a table is ignored by the schema cache code.
Usage:
ActiveRecord.schema_cache_ignored_tables = ["developers"]
ActiveRecord.schema_cache_ignored_tables?("developers")

















    Sorry, something went wrong.
