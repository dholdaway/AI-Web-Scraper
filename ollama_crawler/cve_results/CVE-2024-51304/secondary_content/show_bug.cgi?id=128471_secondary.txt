Description

I think it would be a great idea (especially in light of recent spam/crapflooding by My_dog_Farts_A_TON, ucapa123 and others) if there were a utility for moderators to be able to quickly prune an entire user's post history and threads he or she may have started. 

For example, with something like this last string of crapflood, I think it would be reasonable to report one dustbin'ed thread to the "Accounts used for SPAM" thread and click a "Prune Posts" option in the user's profile which would delete all such non-Dustbin posts and threads the person has created or started, respectively. 

Thanks.

I've already implemented this for admins, it's available from the dustbin button.

Not for us Mods though codergeek, only for admins. We had a chat about it and I agree with tomk's decision to make it an admin-only feature.
