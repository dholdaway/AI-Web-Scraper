On trying to update from audacious-1.5.1-r3 to current stable 2.1 emerge fails just after the config. From what I can tell its a problem with one of the audtool functions. Haven't found anything about this error or anything similar on the net which is weird. Also I run pretty similar installs on my laptop and pc and it emerged fine on the laptop so :/ Also audacious-1.5.1-r3 re-emerges fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.emerge audacious
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
emerge fails

Expected Results:  
audacious should update to version 2.1

I suspect you have old headers lingering in /usr/local; please try a find /usr/local | grep audacious

If you get output, you need to clean up. If you do not get output for that command, please reopen the bug if 2.2_alpha1 does not clear this up for you.

Hi Tony

Nothing in /usr/local to do with audacious it seems. I'll wait for that alpha release and see if it resolves that issue. Theres no real rush 1.5 is serving it purpose for the time being. Thanks for the help.

Thanks for the tip! I finally managed to emerge audacious-2.1 by removing /usr/lib64/libaudclient*!

The filename version of the deleted lib was 1.0.0. The previous version (installed by portage) was audacious-1.5.1-r1.
