Description


C. Wijtmans





          2013-02-16 22:09:16 UTC
        

Trying to push to git with qt-creator and i get this message:


22:54 Executing in xxx: /usr/bin/git push
error: cannot run ssh-askpass: No such file or directory
fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': No such device or address
The command '/usr/bin/git' terminated with exit code 128.

I am running on KDE and emerged net-misc/ksshaskpass but it doesnt create a symlink or anything to ssh-askpass.
Tried searching around and i dont know how to input my password manually and doesnt seem very safe to do so.
Missing a dependency on git or qt-creator?

i uploaded some files to provide a ssh-askpass symbolic link with eselect, requires two new packages.

also this seems to be a problem with qt-creator and not with git.

I'm not sure if I agree... for example I use pam_ssh to setup ssh-agent at login, therefore I don't need any askpass program...

I agree. People who need an askpass program would know what to install. Not everyone needs it (I don't, I use keychain)
