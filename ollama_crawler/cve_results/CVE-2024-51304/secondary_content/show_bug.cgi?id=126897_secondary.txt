emerge mutella - with >=gcc-4.0.1 results in a error with out the above url's patch. I discovered this on the SF mutella site forums, while looking for Documentation on the subject. The change to mutella-0.4.5.ebuild was simple also, I meerly had to add the following lines. 

+inherit eutils
+src_unpack() {
+  unpack ${A}
+  epatch ${FILESDIR}/mutella-gcc4-fix
+}

note I renamed the diff to something similar to what other patches look like among other ebuilds. This patch may or may not break the compilation with earlier versions of gcc.

ty, Matt B

This is the Diff file renamed, from my overlay directory.

next I'll offer the ebuild.

This is the Ebuild from my overlay in /usr/local/portage/net-p2p/mutella

Here's the Ebuild I use. This is all I have on the subject, mutella works.

As I said, this worked. Its a fairly simple change.
<rant> I'm greatful Gentoo has such a simple method of package creation and management. Although I like python, It would be nice to change to a binary package for portage or use shell scripts. That's just an opinion. Would reduce the most minimal install down by a huge package. </rant>
