zile-2.2.24 doesn't distinguish between ^h (help function) and ^? (backspace), even when backspace is configured to send ascii del. I found a small patch online (http://www.mstevens.org/code/zile-backspace.html) that fixes this:

$ cat zile-2.2.24-ctrl-h.patch
--- src/term_ncurses.c.orig     2007-05-29 21:27:53.000000000 +0200
+++ src/term_ncurses.c  2007-05-29 21:28:41.000000000 +0200
@@ -155,6 +155,7 @@
   case KEY_DC:         /* DEL */
     return KBD_DEL;
   case KEY_BACKSPACE:  /* BS */
+    return KBD_CTRL | 'h';
   case 0177:           /* BS */
     return KBD_BS;
   case KEY_IC:         /* INSERT */


Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
keycombo ctrl-h h doesn't produce help text, but a 'h' in the scratch buffer.

Expected Results:  
keycombo ctrl-h h should display zile's help text.

C-h and backspace work for me (on the Linux console).
With your patch applied, backspace doesn't work anymore ...

See also /usr/share/zile/FAQ:
   2.9. The `C-h' key is bound to <BS>/<DEL>; help doesn't work.

In case you observe the problem within an xterm, you may also look at <http://www.ibb.net/~anne/keyboard/keyboard.html#terminfo> for possible solutions.

(In short: "infocmp" should show kbs=\177. If it shows kbs=^H then you have a problem with terminfo.)
