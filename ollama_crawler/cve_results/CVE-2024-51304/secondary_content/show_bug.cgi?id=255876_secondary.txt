Description


Diego Elio Pettenò (RETIRED)






          2009-01-22 00:43:52 UTC
        

Portage warns about pre-stripped files being installed into the image directory; this is a bad thing since it makes Portage's splitdebug feature useless, and it stops the users and the developers from looking into backtraces with full debug information available.

For the developers going to look into it, what you have to look out for, to
find what is stripping the files, is one of these conditions:

- explicit "strip" command run on the produced files;
- "install -s" command to install the binary files;
- "-Wl,-s" flag passed during linking

Remove the "strip" commands, remove the "-s" option at install, and remove
"-Wl,-s" and the problem should be gone.

Thanks,
Diego
