Gnome 2.14.1 (~x86)
I don't have esound running as a service (any more) and in Gnome preferences "Enable software sound mixing" is disabled. So esd is not loaded after Gnome login. When I do logout, esd gets loaded. Why?

should be fixed in 2.20 if you have -esd in your useflags, thanks to dang's patches. Could you give it a try ?

it's not loaded here anytime with gnome 2.20 (even though I have the esd flag on). Closing as worksforme since no input from user.
