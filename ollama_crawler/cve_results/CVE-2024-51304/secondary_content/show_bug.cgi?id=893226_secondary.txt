I don't know what app-marketing/buttonmaker is, but it's not in the ::gentoo repository. Please advise which repository it's in.

Yes it is a joke about the cool "Compile your own button" machine at FOSDEM this weekend.

The whole thing is obviously a joke :)

(And since Andreas is coordinating the FOSDEM activities I thought it fitting to assign him the bug).

Hope this didn't confuse you too much Sam (and maybe even motivates you to visit FOSDEM in the future to meet the European Gentoo community).

I was being a bit literal, sorry!

I was hoping to! I had to cancel very-late-on due to illness. I'll be there next year :)
