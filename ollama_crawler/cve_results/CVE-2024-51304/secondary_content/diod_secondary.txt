 Inside Diodes Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Ship and debit reserves, which arise when we, from time to time based on market conditions, issue credit to certain distributors upon their shipments to their end customers;



 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Average unit cost increased 0.2% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period last year, due to cost increases from various subcontractors and foundries, as well as the cost for a more premium mix of products that were sold in 2023.

 Other - Other   Highlight
On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, which are based upon historical experiences, market trends and financial forecasts and projections, and upon various assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances at that certain point in time.

 Financial - Dividend   Highlight
The Credit Agreement contains certain financial and non-financial covenants, including, but not limited to, a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio, a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, and restrictions on liens, indebtedness, investments, fundamental changes, dispositions, and restricted payments (including dividends and share repurchases).

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Our net sales decreased approximately $338.8 million, or 16.9%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the prior year, due to widespread decreased demand for our semiconductor products.
