Blender changes its Python API very frequently, and at least for me, the present versions (both newer and older) introduce numerous compatibilities (and not just simple ones like method, renaming).

Since we have slots, would it be possible to bring back some version of `=blender-2.90.1*`?

I don't have a fundamental objection to this, although I'm worried about how usable it'll be if you *NEED* Python 3.8 for it to work properly in your case.

I don't think we should bring back an older (non LTS) versions of blender that is not supported any more.

If you really need 2.90.1, you can copy the 2.83 ebuild and rename it to 2.90.1 in a local portage overlay.

You could also download the official stand alone version here:

ok, I went the local overlay root. Indeed it doesn't work with python3.9 or higher, but in any case it would be good to keep old blender versions around...
