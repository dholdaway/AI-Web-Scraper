When installing awstats with the vhost flag active, using webapp-config to install it onto a virtual host, a directory is created under htdocs like "awstats/icon", while the application and related pages refer to "awstats/icons". Seems like a simple typo.

No, it's not a typo. Read the postinstall instructions and setup the needed aliases.

<snip>
Alias /awstats/classes "/usr/share/webapps/awstats/<version>/htdocs/classes/"
Alias /awstats/css "/usr/share/webapps/awstats/<version>/htdocs/css/"
Alias /awstats/icons "/usr/share/webapps/awstats/<version>/htdocs/icon/"
ScriptAlias /awstats/ "/usr/share/webapps/awstats/<version>/hostroot/cgi-bin/"
ScriptAlias /awstats "/usr/share/webapps/awstats/<version>/hostroot/cgi-bin/awstats.pl
"
ScriptAlias /awstats.pl "/usr/share/webapps/awstats/<version>/hostroot/cgi-bin/awstats
.pl"
</snip>

This is completely awful, since you have to change apache config on each upgrade because the /awstats directories aliased via apache are version specific. Additionally it wouldn't make sense then to install these files additionally into the docroot.

I suggest to remove the alias crap from postinstall and fixe the model.conf

kthxbye

Can't do any such thing, it does NOT work without the aliases - plus the config file is per-vhost (that's why you need the aliases). If you dislike it, the tell upstream to provide something better, current removing any aliases is plain no-go.

it works like a charm without an alias on a lot of boxes here

Well, so don't use the aliases if you dislike it. And no, it doesn't work like a charm here, it plain doesn't work at all without them.
