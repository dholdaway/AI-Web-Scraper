 Inside Acadia Realty Trust's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
Subsequent changes in estimated undiscounted cash flows arising from changes in anticipated actions could affect the determination of whether an impairment exists and whether the effects could have a material impact on the Company’s net income.



 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
Expected future cash flows and recoverability conclusions could be materially impacted by changes in items such as future leasing activity, occupancy, property operating costs, market pricing, our view or strategy relative to a tenant’s business or industry, the manner in which a property is used and the expected hold period of an asset.

 Other - Other   Highlight
As a result, the Company could feel pricing pressure on rents that it is able to charge to new or renewing tenants, such that future rents and rent spreads could be negatively impacted.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Except for increased interest costs, we have not experienced any material negative impacts at this time and we intend to actively manage our business to respond to the ongoing economic and social impact from such events.

 Other - Other   Highlight
These provisions are designed to partially mitigate the impact of inflation; however, current inflation levels are greater than the contractual rent increases we obtain from our tenant base.
