EXHIBIT 99.1Star Group, L.P. Reports Fiscal 2023 Fourth Quarter Results
STAMFORD, Conn., Dec.  06, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Star Group, L.P. (the "Company" or "Star") (NYSE:SGU), a home energy distributor and services provider, today announced financial results for the fiscal 2023 fourth quarter and year ended September 30, 2023. Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2022For the fiscal 2023 fourth quarter, Star reported a 10.0 percent decrease in total revenue to $266.9 million compared with $296.6 million in the prior-year period, largely due to a decrease in selling prices and, to a lesser extent, a decline in total petroleum product demand. The volume of home heating oil and propane sold during the fiscal 2023 fourth quarter decreased by 0.6 million gallons, or 3.1 percent, to 18.8 million gallons, and the volume of motor fuel sold declined by 5.8 percent to 34.3 million gallons. Star’s net loss decreased by $30.3 million in the quarter, to $19.7 million, primarily due to a favorable change in the fair value of derivative instruments of $46.8 million, somewhat offset by a decrease in the Company’s income tax benefit of $14.8 million, and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $1.2 million. The Company reported a fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA loss (a non-GAAP measure defined below) of $31.4 million, an increase of $0.7 million, reflecting the lower sales volume and an increase in operating costs of 4.6 percent, largely offset by an increase in home heating oil and propane per-gallon margins. “As we turn the corner on fiscal 2023, I would say the year was, in many respects, similar to the one before – as we experienced elevated oil prices and continued market volatility and, thus, high revenue but, largely due to warmer weather, lower overall product demand,” said Jeff Woosnam, Star Group’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Notably, temperatures for the year were the third warmest in 123 years within the New York City metropolitan area. That said, we maintained our cost discipline, achieved slightly improved net customer attrition versus the prior fiscal year and completed several acquisitions that complement our existing businesses in key geographic areas. We remain focused on effectively managing working capital, controlling operating expenses, and providing the best customer service possible as we head into fiscal 2024.” Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2022For fiscal 2023, Star reported nearly flat revenue year-over-year of $2.0 billion, as a decrease in total volume sold was almost totally offset by an increase in selling prices in response to higher wholesale product costs. The volume of home heating oil and propane sold during fiscal 2023 decreased by 36.9 million gallons, or 12.5 percent, to 259.2 million gallons, with the additional volume provided from acquisitions more than offset by the impact of warmer temperatures, net customer attrition and other factors. Temperatures in Star’s geographic areas of operation for the twelve-month period were 7.7 percent warmer than during the prior fiscal year and 16.3 percent warmer than normal, as reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Star’s net income declined by $3.4 million, to $31.9 million, primarily due to a $13.5 million decrease in Adjusted EBITDA and a $5.0 million increase in interest expense, partially offset by a $15.3 million favorable change in the fair value of derivative instruments. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $13.5 million, to $96.9 million, as a decline in home heating oil and propane volume more than offset an increase in per gallon margins and an $11.4 million higher benefit recorded under the Company’s weather hedge. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP Financial Measures)EBITDA (Earnings from continuing operations before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) and Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings from continuing operations before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, (increase) decrease in the fair value of derivatives, other income (loss), net, multiemployer pension plan withdrawal charge, gain or loss on debt redemption, goodwill impairment, and other non-cash and non-operating charges) are non-GAAP financial measures that are used as supplemental financial measures by management and external users of the Company’s financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks and research analysts, to assess Star’s position with regard to the following: compliance with certain financial covenants included in our debt agreements;financial performance without regard to financing methods, capital structure, income taxes or historical cost basis;operating performance and return on invested capital compared to those of other companies in the retail distribution of refined petroleum products, without regard to financing methods and capital structure;ability to generate cash sufficient to pay interest on our indebtedness and to make distributions to our partners; andthe viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return of alternative investment opportunities. The method of calculating Adjusted EBITDA may not be consistent with that of other companies, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA both have limitations as analytical tools and so should not be viewed in isolation but in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with GAAP. Some of the limitations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are as follows: EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect cash used for capital expenditures;although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated or amortized often will have to be replaced and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the cash requirements for such replacements;EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital;EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the cash necessary to make payments of interest or principal on indebtedness; andEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the cash required to pay taxes. REMINDER:Members of Star's management team will host a webcast and conference call at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time tomorrow, December 7, 2023. The webcast will be accessible on the company’s website, at www.stargrouplp.com, and the telephone number for the conference call is 1-888-346-3470 (or 1-412-317-5169 for international callers). About Star Group, L.P.Star Group, L.P. is a full service provider specializing in the sale of home heating products and services to residential and commercial customers to heat their homes and buildings. The Company also sells and services heating and air conditioning equipment to its home heating oil and propane customers and, to a lesser extent, provides these offerings to customers outside of its home heating oil and propane customer base. Star also sells diesel, gasoline and home heating oil on a delivery only basis. We believe Star is the nation's largest retail distributor of home heating oil based upon sales volume. Including its propane locations, Star serves customers in the more northern and eastern states within the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic U.S. regions. Additional information is available by obtaining the Company's SEC filings at www.sec.gov and by visiting Star's website at www.stargrouplp.com, where unit holders may request a hard copy of Star’s complete audited financial statements free of charge.

 Inside Star Group, L.P.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Depreciation and Amortization Expenses For fiscal 2023, depreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.2 million, or 0.8%, to $32.4 million, compared to $32.6 million for fiscal 2022, primarily due to lower amortization expense related to intangible assets that fully amortized in the prior fiscal year.



 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
The increase was partially offset by a $25.9 million unfavorable change in accounts payable due to the pricing and timing of inventory purchases, an $11.7 million decrease in cash flows from operations, $5.2 million more in payroll taxes paid in the first fiscal quarter of 2023 versus the first fiscal quarter of 2022 as the result of deferring payment of certain payroll tax withholdings in first quarter of fiscal 2021 to the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2023, and $2.8 million of other net changes in working capital.

 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
The method of calculating Adjusted EBITDA may not be consistent with that of other companies, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA both have limitations as analytical tools and so should not be viewed in isolation and should be viewed in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with GAAP.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
While accounts receivable were higher by $38.6 million, or 38.7%, during fiscal 2022 than fiscal 2021, days' sales outstanding remained fairly consistent with the prior year.

 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
To the extent our interest rate derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are effective, as defined under this guidance, changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income until the forecasted hedged item is recognized in earnings.
