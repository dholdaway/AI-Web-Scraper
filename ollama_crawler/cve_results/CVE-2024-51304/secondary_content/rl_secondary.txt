 Inside Ralph Lauren Corp's 10-K Annual Report:

However, unforeseen adverse future economic and market conditions, such as those resulting from widespread pandemic diseases and/or other catastrophic events, could result in our actual results differing materially from our estimates.



 Other - Other   Highlight
However, unforeseen adverse future economic and market conditions could result in our actual results differing materially from our estimates.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
Changes in economic conditions, most notably persisting inflationary pressures (including increases in the cost of raw materials, transportation, and salaries & benefits), high interest rates, significant foreign currency volatility, bank failures, and concerns of a potential recession, continue to impact consumer discretionary income levels, spending, and sentiment in the U.S. and beyond.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
The 210 basis point decline was primarily driven by inflationary cost pressures, unfavorable foreign currency effects, and higher non-routine inventory charges recorded during Fiscal 2023 as compared to the prior fiscal year, partially offset by higher pricing.
