It is common practice to mark packages stable 30 or more days after adding a ~arch keyword. Remembering what you keyworded a month ago is hard, so I wrote a patch for ekeyword that logs whenever you add a ~arch keyword. It adds a line to ~/.ekeyword_tildearch.log in the following format "2006 06 07 Added ~alpha to mutagen-1.4.ebuild" if the ECHANGELOG_TILDEARCH_LOG env variable is set. I'll attach the patch to this bug.

Created attachment 88612 [details, diff]
ekeyword-tildearch-log.patch

Disclaimer: I haven't done very much perl programming, so this might be crap, but it works for me.

Aron, you've done all of the work on ekeyword, what is your opinion?

policy for such changes is to add a line to the ChangeLog ... so information on when ~keyword was added should already be available
