in /etc/man.pages 
NROFF           /usr/bin/nroff -Tascii -c -mandoc
that why man is unreadable for localized man pages.
must be use there
NROFF           /usr/bin/nroff -Tlatin1 -c -mandoc

and check for other localized man pages

Huh, illegal?

<snip>
case "`exec 2>/dev/null ; locale charmap`" in
  UTF-8)
    T=-Tutf8 ;;
  ISO-8859-1)
    T=-Tlatin1 ;;
  IBM-1047)
    T=-Tcp1047 ;;
  *)
</snip>

The default value is just fine for en_US; if you are using UTF-8 then it's covered by http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/utf-8.xml#doc_chap2, if you are using something else then ask the translators to document this in http://www.gentoo.org/doc/ru/guide-localization.xml.

Not a man bug.

man nroff

<snip>
The nroff script emulates the nroff command using groff. Only ascii, latin1, utf8, and cp1047 are valid arguments for the -T option, selecting the output encoding emitted by grotty, groff's TTY output device. If  an  invalid  or  no  -T option is given, nroff checks the current locale to select a default output device.  It first tries the locale program, then the environment variables LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, and LANG, and finally the LESSCHARSET environment variable.
</snip>

well, if there is 
NROFF           /usr/bin/nroff -Tascii -c -mandoc
in /etc/man.conf when there is no matter to values of LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, and LANG, and finally the LESSCHARSET. If there is 
NROFF           /usr/bin/nroff -c -mandoc
(no -Tascii) in /etc/man.conf and when
$ LESSCHARSET="latin1" man ls
works fine.

In case of KOI8-R locale -T option mustn't be used or used latin1.

So set it as you need, there's no illegal parameter in there.
