When I tried to emerge iiimf related applications, none of the package can download the source required for compilation.  There's the list of package that has broken links:

app-i18n/iiimgcf-11.4_p1467
dev-libs/libiiimcf-11.4_p1467
dev-libs/libiiimp-11.4_p1467
dev-libs/eimil-11.4_p1467
app-i18n/iiimxcf-11.4_p1467
app-i18n/iiimsf-11.4_p1467
app-i18n/iiimcf-11.4_p1467

Here's the error log:

>>> Downloading http://www.openi18n.org/download/im-sdk/src/iiimf-src-11.4_p1467.tar.bz2

Matsuu,

I noticed that you committed iiimf to the ebuildjp overlay that replaces the
6 or 7 ebuilds that are currently in app-i18n. Is it possible to replace the
current iimf* ebuilds in portage with that because I think your ebuild is
much better  than the current iiimf.eclass ebuilds.

Thanks!

Set yourself GENTOO_MIRRORS in make.conf, thanks.
