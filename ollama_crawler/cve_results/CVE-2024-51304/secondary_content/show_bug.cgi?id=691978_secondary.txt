right now, ctest only reports failed tests as failed. With ctest --output-on-failure it would increase verbosity, by throwing out anything that the failed test program has thrown out before.

cmake-utils.eclass is already doing that:

> [[ -n ${TEST_VERBOSE} ]] && myctestargs+=( --extra-verbose --output-on-failure )

There's also:

> if [[ -n "${CMAKE_YES_I_WANT_TO_SEE_THE_TEST_LOG}" ]] ; then
> (prints LastTest.log)

So, just set these variables to get more verbosity. ;)
