 Inside Diamondback Energy, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Viper retained a partial valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets due primarily to potential future volatility in commodity prices and an inherent lack of visibility to certain underlying operator activity for more than relatively short periods of time, which could impact the likelihood of future realizability.



 Other - Other   Highlight
Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the registrant.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements of this report.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Although the impact of inflation on our business has been insignificant in prior periods, inflation in the U.S. has been rising at its fastest rate in over 40 years, creating inflationary pressure on the cost of services, equipment and other goods in the energy industry and other sectors, which is contributing to labor and materials shortages across the supply-chain.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Negative evidence may include losses in recent years, if any, or the projection of losses in future periods.
