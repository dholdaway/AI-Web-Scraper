Can you reproduce this with liferea-1.8_rc1 ? I have just updated this ebuild, so you must wait some time until it's available in your mirror.

Still fails with liferea-1.8_rc1. I'll attach the new stack trace.

It catches my eye the fact that even if you have specified ACCEPT_KEYWORDS=amd64 you are using ~arch webkit-gtk.

I guess you're using libpng-1.5.5, and that you already have executed revdep-rebuild.

Hm. the thing about amd64 instead of ~amd64 looks like a bug. I've reported it to the paludis guys. I'm actually completely on ~amd64 with nothing masked or unmasked by me.

I'm using libpng-1.5.5 and revdep-rebuild only wants to rebuild shotwell which is caused by https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=384165

Problem occurs with liferea-1.7.1-r1 here (amd64).
Segfaults with very similar stack :

Looks like this somehow solved itself, at least for me. Maybe this was a transient issue about liferea-1.7 <-> webkit-gtk-1.4.X.

I'm currently using webkit-gtk-1.8.1 and everything looks fine.
