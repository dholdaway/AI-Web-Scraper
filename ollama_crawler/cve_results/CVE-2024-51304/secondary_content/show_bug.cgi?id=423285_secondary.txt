What's the best way to fix this? Full log attached...

***** automake *****
***** PWD: /var/tmp/portage/app-text/xournal-0.4.5_p20111022-r2/work/xournal-0.4.5_p20111022
***** automake --add-missing --copy

configure.in:4: version mismatch. This is Automake 1.11.1,
configure.in:4: but the definition used by this AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE
configure.in:4: comes from Automake 1.11. You should recreate
configure.in:4: aclocal.m4 with aclocal and run automake again.
configure.in:20: installing `./config.guess'
configure.in:20: installing `./config.sub'

Same with automake 1.11.5

For the record I "fixed" this by saying in the ebuild

+       rm -f "${S}/aclocal.m4"  # bug 423285
        eautoreconf

Feel free to close the bug, but I think there should be a better way to do that?

i can't reproduce this with automake-1.11.6.  i tried:
 - grabbed last xournal-0.4.5_p20111022-r2.ebuild from cvs
 - deleted the `rm` line
 - ran `WANT_AUTOMAKE=1.11 ebuild ... clean unpack prepare`
 - automake ran fine w/out warnings about mismatch

let's assume it was a problem with earlier 1.11.x versions and the later releases fixed the problem.
