Description

When I tried to run spyder-3.3.1, I got an exception. I tracked it down to an exception for its qtconsole dependency:

https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/3595

This suggests updating dev-python/pyzmq (to in-portage 17.1.0 for us). This fixed that exception for me. But then another one was triggered:

https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/6783

This suggests updating dev-python/ipykernel (to in-portage 4.8.2 for us). This fixed the second exception and make qtconsole and spyder work again.

I guess this was triggered by the stabilization of www-servers/tornado to 5.1 recently (since I last ran spyder).

I guess one way of solving this bug is to stabilize the two packages I updated (also triggers +drafts use flag to net-libs/zeromq). But some more complex dependency formulation is also possible.
