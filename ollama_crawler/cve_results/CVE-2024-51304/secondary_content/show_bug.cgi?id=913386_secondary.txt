Hi,

As I've taken up maintenance of www-servers/apache and associated packages it would be helpful to have access to proj/apache.git which is the canonical source of the gentoo apache tarballs that we generate for each release.

Please let me know if any additional information is needed.

Hans,

that repository is already open for all developers:

repo proj/apache
        RW+ = @devs
        R   = @all daemon gitweb

Do you need anything different / special?

Right now, it has:

repo proj/apache
        RW+ = @devs
        R   = @all daemon gitweb

I could restrict it to you / apache members if you want though, but you should be able to push already (unless I'm looking at the wrong repo)?

Ah, right. Didn't think to try first :-)

This works as expected, no need to limit this if this was the original setup, I think.

Thanks!
