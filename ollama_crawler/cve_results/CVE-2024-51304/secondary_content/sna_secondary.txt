 Snap-on Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Results 

 Diluted EPS of $4.75 for the quarter represents a gain of 7.5% from Q4 2022; 
Sales of $1,196.6 million up 3.5% from Q4 2022, organic sales up 2.2%; 
Operating margin before financial services of 21.6% compares to 21.5% in Q4 2022 



KENOSHA, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 8, 2024--Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE: SNA), a leading global innovator, manufacturer and marketer of tools, equipment, diagnostics, repair information and systems solutions for professional users
              performing critical tasks, today announced 2023 operating results for the fourth quarter and full year. 

 Net sales of $1,196.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 represented an increase of $40.7 million, or 3.5%, from 2022 levels, reflecting a $26.1 million, or 2.2%, organic gain, $5.5 million of acquisition-related sales, and $9.1
                million of favorable foreign currency translation. 


 Operating earnings before financial services for the quarter of $257.9 million compared to $248.0 million in 2022. As a percentage of net sales, operating earnings before financial services were 21.6% in the fourth quarter compared to
                21.5% last year. 


 Financial services revenue in the quarter of $97.2 million compared to $88.3 million in 2022; financial services operating earnings of $67.9 million compared to $63.9 million last year. 


 Consolidated operating earnings for the quarter of $325.8 million, or 25.2% of revenues (net sales plus financial services revenue), compared to $311.9 million, or 25.1% of revenues, last year. 


 The fourth quarter effective income tax rate was 21.4% in 2023 and 22.0% in 2022. 


 Net earnings in the quarter of $255.3 million, or $4.75 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $238.9 million, or $4.42 per diluted share, a year ago. 


 Full year net sales of $4,730.2 million in 2023 represented an increase of $237.4 million, or 5.3%, from 2022 levels, reflecting a $250.7 million, or 5.6%, organic gain and $5.5 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by
                $18.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Full year net earnings of $1,011.1 million compared to net earnings of $911.7 million last year, and diluted earnings per share of $18.76 represented an increase of 11.5% from
                $16.82 per diluted share in 2022. 

 See “Non-GAAP Measures” below for a definition of, and further explanation about, organic sales. 
 “We’re encouraged by our 2023 performance which reflects steadfast progress along both our runways for growth and our runways for improvement, and aligns with our ongoing, longer-term expectations for sales and operating income expansion,
              all achieved against the significant variation and turbulence that mark the commercial arenas of today,” said Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on chairman and chief executive officer. “In the fourth quarter, our businesses serving critical industries
              demonstrated continuing positive momentum and the acquisition of Mountz, Inc. extended our product offering for this important customer segment where the need for precision is building and the penalty for failure is high. We’ve again
              leveraged our Snap-on Value Creation Processes to deliver profitability and earnings gains in an uncertain environment. While this quarter exhibited variability in some operations, we are confident in believing that the resilience of our
              markets, the substantial strength of our enterprise, and the considerable capabilities of our experienced teams will provide for further advancement in the periods to come. Finally, I want to thank our franchisees and our associates worldwide
              for their valuable contributions, for their unfailing dedication, and for their deep belief in our prospects as we move forward through 2024 and beyond.”

 Inside Snapon Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Shares   Highlight
Should the operations of the businesses with which goodwill is associated incur significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances, such as declines in profitability and cash flow due to long-term deterioration in macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, the loss of key customers, changes in technology or markets, changes in key personnel or litigation, a sustained decrease in share price and/or other events, some or all of the recorded goodwill could be subject to impairment and could result in a material adverse effect on Snap-on’s financial position or results of operations.



 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
Determination of the proper level of allowance requires management to exercise judgment about the timing, frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision for credit losses and, as a result, net earnings.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Changes in economic conditions and assumptions, including the resulting credit quality metrics relative to the performance of the finance receivables portfolio, create uncertainty and could result in changes to both the allowance for credit losses and provision for credit losses.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Allowance for Credit Losses on Finance Receivables: The allowance for credit losses on finance receivables is maintained at a level management believes is adequate to cover expected losses in Snap-on’s finance receivables portfolio as of the reporting date.

 Other - Other   Highlight
The allowance represents management’s estimate of the expected losses in the company’s finance receivables portfolio based on ongoing assessments and evaluations of credit losses over the remaining contractual life of the receivables portfolio considering collectability, historical loss experience, current conditions and future market changes.
