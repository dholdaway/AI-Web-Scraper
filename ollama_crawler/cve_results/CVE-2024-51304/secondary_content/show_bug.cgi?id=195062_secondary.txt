The bug doesn't reproduce when playing the asx file from the address bar directly. The link that crashes konqueror was trying to open the asx playlist in a new window, and that's what causes the problem (http://www.ynet.co.il/home/0,7340,L-4906,00.html). Konqueror crashes when hitting the "play" link, always.

Can you post emerge --info too, please ?

I tried opening the 2 links here and konqueror didn't crash.
http://players.mediazone.co.il/media/authors/34/playlists/21750/21750_static.asx
http://www.ynet.co.il/home/0,7340,L-4906,00.html

I have the following kde packages:

user@host ~ $ qlist -IUv konqueror
kde-base/konqueror-3.5.7-r2
kde-base/konqueror-akregator-3.5.7
user@host ~ $ qlist -IUv nsplugins
kde-base/nsplugins-3.5.7
user@host ~ $ qlist -IUv flash

I was able to narrow it down - 
The problem is with a certain link in the page, that is basically derived from an iframe.
You could try this link - http://players.mediazone.co.il/media/authors/34/playlists/21768/players/5/?autostart=true
and hit the "play" link.
I tried it with my konqueror, and it crashes every time.

I'm attaching my emerge --info as well.

Please try with 3.5.8. I can't reproduce your crash using it.

No response and it works for me.
