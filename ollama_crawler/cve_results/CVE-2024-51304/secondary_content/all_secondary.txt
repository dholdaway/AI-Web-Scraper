 Inside Allstate Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Reserves for catastrophe losses  Catastrophe losses are an inherent risk of the property and casualty insurance industry that have contributed, and will continue to contribute, to potentially material year-to-year fluctuations in our results of operations and financial position.



 Other - Other   Highlight
For example, for hurricanes, complications could include the inability of insureds to promptly report losses, limitations placed on claims adjusting staff affecting their ability to inspect losses, determining whether losses are covered by our homeowners policy (generally for damage caused by wind or wind driven rain) or specifically excluded coverage caused by flood, exposure to mold damage, and the effects of numerous other considerations, including the timing of a catastrophe in relation to other events, such as at or near the end of a financial reporting period, which can affect the availability of information needed to estimate reserves for that reporting period.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Changes in estimates could result in additional changes to the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
Decreases in rates could increase the fair value of our fixed income securities portfolio while decreasing future investment income due to reinvestment at lower market yields and accelerated pay-downs and prepayments of certain investments.

 Financial - Shares   Highlight
