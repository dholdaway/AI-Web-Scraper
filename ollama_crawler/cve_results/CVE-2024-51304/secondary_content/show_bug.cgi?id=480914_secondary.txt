Description

Bisecting sometimes requires numerous reboots - and having just 1 grub entry for all created kernels would help, eg.:

currently we do have "kernel-genkernel-x86-3.11.0-rc5+"
but it would be nice to just have "kernel-test"

The newer genkernel can use grub set-default to ensure the new boot goes to the latest built kernel.

I used it for bisecting an issue recently.
