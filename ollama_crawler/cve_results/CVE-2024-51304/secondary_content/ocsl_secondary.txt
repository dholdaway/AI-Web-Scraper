Exhibit 99.1   


 Oaktree Specialty Lending Corporation Announces Third Fiscal Quarter 2023 Financial Results 
and Declares Distribution of $0.55 Per Share  LOS ANGELES, CA,
August 3, 2023 - Oaktree Specialty Lending Corporation (NASDAQ: OCSL) (Oaktree Specialty Lending or the Company), a specialty finance company, today announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended
June 30, 2023.  Financial Highlights for the Quarter Ended June 30, 20231 
 


 

 
 Total investment income was $101.9 million ($1.32 per share) for the third fiscal quarter of 2023, as compared
with $96.3 million ($1.32 per share) for the second fiscal quarter of 2023. Adjusted total investment income was $101.1 million ($1.31 per share) for the third fiscal quarter of 2023, as compared with $95.7 million ($1.31 per share)
for the second fiscal quarter of 2023. The increase on a dollar basis was primarily driven by the first full quarter of interest income earned on the assets acquired in the merger with Oaktree Strategic Income II, Inc. (OSI2) (the
OSI2 Merger) as well as the impact of higher base rates on the Companys floating rate debt portfolio.   


 

 
 GAAP net investment income was $48.4 million ($0.63 per share) for the third fiscal quarter of
2023, as compared with $46.0 million ($0.63 per share) for the second fiscal quarter of 2023. The increase on a dollar basis was primarily driven by higher total investment income and lower operating expenses, which was partially offset by
higher interest expense, management fees and Part I incentive fees.   


 

 
 Adjusted net investment income was $47.6 million ($0.62 per share) for the third fiscal quarter
of 2023, as compared with $45.4 million ($0.62 per share) for the second fiscal quarter of 2023. The increase on a dollar basis was primarily the result of higher adjusted total investment income and lower operating expenses, which was
partially offset by higher interest expense, management fees and Part I incentive fees.   


 

 
 Net asset value (NAV) per share was $19.58 as of June 30, 2023, down slightly as compared with
$19.66 as of March 31, 2023, which was mainly the result of unrealized depreciation on debt investments, partially offset by undistributed net investment income. 
 


 

 
 Originated $251.0 million of new investment commitments and received $261.0 million of proceeds from
prepayments, exits, other paydowns and sales during the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The weighted average yield on new debt investments was 12.6%.   


 

 
 Total debt outstanding was $1,785.0 million as of June 30, 2023. The total debt to equity ratio was 1.18x,
and the net debt to equity ratio was 1.14x, after adjusting for cash and cash equivalents.   


 

 
 Upsized and extended maturity of the syndicated credit facility during the quarter ended June 30, 2023. Total
commitments were increased from $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion and the maturity was extended to June 2028. Pricing, advance rates and other general terms were unchanged on the amended facility. 
 


 

 
 Liquidity as of June 30, 2023 was comprised of $59.7 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and
$482.5 million of undrawn capacity under the Companys credit facilities (subject to borrowing base and other limitations). Unfunded investment commitments were $274.4 million, or $247.3 million excluding unfunded commitments to
the Companys joint ventures. Of the $247.3 million, approximately $185.2 million can be drawn immediately with the remaining amount subject to certain milestones that must be met by portfolio companies. 
 


 

 
 A quarterly cash distribution was declared of $0.55 per share. The distribution is payable in cash on
September 29, 2023 to stockholders of record on September 15, 2023.   
 


1
 The Company completed a 1-for-3 reverse
stock split on January 20, 2023, effective as of the commencement of trading on January 23, 2023. All share amounts and per share information included in this press release reflect the reverse stock split on a retroactive basis.

 Inside Oaktree Specialty Lending Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Revenue - Product   Highlight
During that period, net cash provided by operating activities was $22.4 million, primarily from $693.7 million of principal payments and sale proceeds received, $22.4 million of net increase in payables from unsettled transactions and the cash activities related to $148.6 million of net investment income, partially offset by funding $702.1 million of investments, $43.9 million of increase in due from broker (cash held at a broker to cover collateral obligations under the interest swap agreement) and $20.5 million increase in due from portfolio companies.



 Legal - Other   Highlight
Other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include: changes or potential disruptions in our operations, the economy, financial markets or political environment, including those caused by inflation and a rising interest rate environment; risks associated with a possible disruption in our operations, the operations of our portfolio companies or the economy generally due to terrorism, war or other geopolitical conflict, natural disasters, pandemics or cybersecurity incidents; future changes in laws or regulations (including the interpretation of these laws and regulations by regulatory authorities) and conditions in our operating areas, particularly with respect to Business Development Companies or RICs; and other considerations that may be disclosed from time to time in our publicly disseminated documents and filings.

 Financial - Debt   Highlight
The accrual of PIK interest on our debt investments increases the recorded cost bases of these investments in our Consolidated Financial Statements including for purposes of computing the capital gains incentive fee payable by us to Oaktree.

 Financial - Shares   Highlight
On February 7, 2022, we entered into an equity distribution agreement by and among us, Oaktree, Oaktree Administrator and Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc., JMP Securities LLC, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. and SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., as placement agents, in connection with the issuance and sale by us of shares of common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $125.0 million.
