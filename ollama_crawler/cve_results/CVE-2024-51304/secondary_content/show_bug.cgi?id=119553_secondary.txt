Hi. I was genlop user - great tool. :) Then I've tried portage-utils. q* are super-duper tools, and qlop provides same functionality like genlop. Same = same colors, output, just all! Dunno, but isn't genlop obsolete now?

There isn't anything wrong with two tools doing the same (or similar) job as long as they're maintained.
