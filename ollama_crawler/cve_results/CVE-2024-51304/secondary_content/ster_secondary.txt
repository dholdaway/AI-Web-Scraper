 Sterling Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Results 
Successful Execution on 2023 Goals and Long-Term Strategy 
Early Realization of $25M Annualized Cost Savings Target 
Separately Announces Transaction with First Advantage; Cancels Q4 2023 Earnings Conference Call 
OHIO, February 29, 2024 (GLOBENEWSWIRE)  Sterling Check Corp. (NASDAQ: STER) (Sterling or the Company) a leading global
provider of technology-enabled background and identity verification services, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. 
Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights  All results compared to
prior-year period.   


 

 
 Revenues decreased 0.3% year-over-year to $169.4 million. Organic constant currency revenue decreased 2.8%
and inorganic revenue growth was 2.2%. Organic revenue growth included a return to our long-term growth target of 7% for new business and an acceleration in up-sell/cross-sell to 8% alongside continued
delivery on our long-term target for gross revenue retention of 96%.   


 

 
 GAAP net loss decreased year-over-year to a loss of $3.4 million, or $(0.04) per diluted share, compared to
GAAP net loss of $7.7 million, or $(0.08) per diluted share, for the prior year period.   


 

 
 Adjusted EBITDA increased 1.5% year-over-year to $41.9 million. Adjusted EBITDA Margin increased 40 bps
year-over-year to 24.7% due to continued progress in our cost optimization programs and financial discipline.   


 

 
 Adjusted Net Income decreased 3.8% year-over-year to $19.7 million. Adjusted Earnings Per Sharediluted
was flat year-over-year at $0.21 per diluted share due to the benefit of our share repurchase program.  Full Year 2023 Highlights
 All results compared to prior-year period.   


 

 
 Revenues decreased 6.1% year-over-year to $719.6 million. Organic constant currency revenue decreased 8.2%
as base declines offset solid results in other growth drivers in our control. Inorganic revenue growth was 2.3%.   


 

 
 GAAP net loss was $0.1 million, or $0.00 per diluted share, compared to net income of $19.4 million, or
$0.20 per diluted share, for the prior year period.   


 

 
 Adjusted EBITDA decreased 6.8% year-over-year to $185.0 million. Adjusted EBITDA Margin decreased 20 bps
year-over-year to 25.7%.   


 

 
 Adjusted Net Income decreased 11.9% year-over-year to $93.9 million. Adjusted Earnings Per
Sharediluted decreased 7.4% year-over-year to $1.00 per diluted share.  Organic constant currency revenue growth (decline),
Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Earnings Per Sharediluted are non-GAAP measures. Please see the schedules accompanying this earnings release for a
reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures, as applicable.  Josh Peirez, Sterling CEO, said, The fourth
quarter of 2023 capped off a solid year in which we made continued progress on our long-term strategy and near-term focus areas. Throughout the year, we executed on the items within our control, both on the top line and in our cost structure, and
our focused efforts have enabled early realization of our $25M annualized cost savings target as well as an enhanced revenue exit velocity going into 2024. 
The challenges created by the macro environment in 2023 lasted longer than we had anticipated, leading to base declines in excess of our initial expectations.
Still, we saw strong results and improvement through the year, including substantial acceleration in our new business and up-sell/cross-sell during the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we achieved or
exceeded our long-term targets for all revenue drivers in our control  new business, up/cross-sell, and customer attrition  an exciting accomplishment which provides us significant momentum for 2024 in addition to the benefit of easier
year-over-year comps in our base business.
