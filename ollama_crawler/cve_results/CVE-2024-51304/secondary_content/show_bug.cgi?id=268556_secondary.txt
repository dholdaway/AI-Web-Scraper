Since Portage does its own file digest verification, any SSL warnings should be ignored:

FETCHCOMMAND="/usr/bin/wget --no-check-certificate -t 5 -T 60 --passive-ftp -O "${DISTDIR}/${FILE}" "${URI}""                                                                          RESUMECOMMAND="/usr/bin/wget --no-check-certificate -c -t 5 -T 60 --passive-ftp -O "${DISTDIR}/${FILE}" "${URI}""

This is fine most of the time, but not necessarily a good thing when a developer first downloads the distfiles to create the initial distfiles digests. Given this, is there a compelling reason to change the existing default?

It is necessary because many legit sites aren't recognised by wget. In particular, Maemo Garage.

if it were "many legit sites" i imagine we'd see more complaints from people.  maemo garage works fine with my wget:
wget https://garage.maemo.org/frs/download.php/7151/vncviewer_0.6.4-fremantle2_armel.deb

in general, i dont like the idea of ignoring ssl cert issues
