EQUITRANS MIDSTREAM ANNOUNCES FULL-YEAR and FOURTH QUARTER 2023 RESULTS Canonsburg, PA (February 20, 2024) – Equitrans Midstream Corporation (NYSE: ETRN), today, announced financial and operational results for the full-year and fourth quarter 2023. Included in the "Non-GAAP Disclosures" section of this news release are important disclosures regarding the use of non-GAAP supplemental financial measures, including information regarding their most comparable GAAP financial measure.2023 Highlights: •Reported $454.8 million of net income and $1.1 billion of Adjusted EBITDA•Generated $1.0 billion of net cash from operating activities•Recorded ~70% of total operating revenue from firm reservation fees•Achieved ~8% transmission pipeline throughput growth versus 2022•Achieved ~29% water operating revenue growth versus 2022•Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 enacted in June 2023; provisions for 'Expediting Completion of the MVP'•Signed precedent agreements collectively providing 550 MMcf per day firm capacity in support of an amended Southgate project"Following enactment of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, we have made substantial construction progress on the Mountain Valley Pipeline, and the major tasks to complete the pipeline continue to narrow,” said Diana M. Charletta, president and chief executive officer for Equitrans Midstream. “As we exited 2023, we continued to track to our prior guidance, despite challenging construction conditions causing lower productivity than forecasted. Along with unforeseen construction challenges, throughout much of January, construction crews encountered adverse weather conditions, including precipitation well above 20-year averages. While our construction plans took into account the potential effects of winter weather, these conditions were far worse and longer in duration than anticipated, imposing a significant impact on productivity, which, in turn, impeded our ability to reduce construction headcount. Collectively, these factors resulted in our updated timing and total project cost targets. ETRN is now targeting construction completion and commissioning in the second quarter of 2024, at a total estimated project cost ranging from approximately $7.57 billion to approximately $7.63 billion."Charletta continued, “As our teams continue to look for ways to optimize and grow our asset base, we are pleased with the strong results our business once again delivered for our stakeholders. Notably, we made significant progress on our in-basin organic projects, including the Ohio Valley Connector Expansion and a booster compression project for a producer customer, both of which are targeted for in-service in the first half of 2024, and we continued the build out of our mixed-use water system. Looking ahead, our well-integrated and strategically located system of gathering, transmission, and water assets is uniquely positioned to capture the benefits of MVP’s in-service.”"Our Board of Directors has been engaged in a process with third parties that have expressed interest in strategic transactions with our Company,” said Thomas F. Karam, Equitrans’ executive chairman. “This interest is not surprising given the expected near-term completion of MVP, and our view of the strength of our underlying assets. Our board has engaged outside advisors and the process is ongoing. There is no guarantee that any transaction will result from this process. The organization’s top priority remains safely bringing MVP into service and continuing to provide superior service to our customers."1The following information was filed by Equitrans Midstream Corp (ETRN) on Tuesday, February 20, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.

 Inside Equitrans Midstream Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
These accounting estimates could potentially have a material effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position.



 Other - Other   Highlight
In addition, the Company believes that the accounting estimates related to the allowance for credit losses are "critical accounting estimates" because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change and the actual mix of customers and their ability to pay may vary significantly from management's estimates, which could affect the collectability of customer receivables.

 Other - Other   Highlight
When a quantitative assessment is performed, the Company uses estimates and assumptions in estimating its reporting units’ fair values that it believes are reasonable and appropriate at that time; however, different assumptions and estimates could materially affect the calculated fair value and the resulting conclusion of whether goodwill is impaired, which could materially affect the Company’s results of operations and financial position.

 Financial - Shares   Highlight
Additionally, financing transactions may increase our financial leverage or could cause dilution to our shareholders.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
The Company believes that accounting estimates related to income taxes are "critical accounting estimates" because the Company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income, and exercise judgment when evaluating whether or not a valuation allowance must be established on deferred tax assets.
