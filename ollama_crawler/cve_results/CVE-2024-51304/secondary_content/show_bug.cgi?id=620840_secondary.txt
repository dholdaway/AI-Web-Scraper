the digest for metadata.xml isn't kept on the source tree, its generated by the git-to-rsync relay.

So likely this is a result of something else failing and breaking manifest update somewhere, and hopefully, all that will be needed is for you to wait a day and re-sync, and it should go away on its own.

/usr/portage/dev-perl/Date-Manip$ ebuild Date-Manip-6.590.0.ebuild fetch

works here. Please reopen, if the problem still exists.
