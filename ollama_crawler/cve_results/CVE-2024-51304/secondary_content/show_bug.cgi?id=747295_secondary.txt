At runtime, during the connection to a remote system, it fails with a message box saying libpcsclite.so is not found.

Installing pcsc-lite resolves this issue.

I doubt this is required for all Citrix environments. The two Citrix Servers I connect to both don't require pcsc-lite. I also don't see any file that links to libpcsclite.so in icaclient package. Perhaps some dependency that is an optional requirement if the Citrix server is configured specially?

Perhaps.
