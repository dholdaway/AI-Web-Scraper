I've built facter against boost 1.62.0-r1 for a while now (whenever I test it since 26/1/2017).  I've never seen this.  I am on GCC 5.4.0 though, so maybe that's it.  Mind reproducing after updating (5.4.0 is stable now)?

The last time I upgraded gcc several of my packages broke. So, I'm planning to do a complete system rebuild in a chroot.
Bottom line is that it will be a least a week before I get back to you.

If you need help with the gcc update or rebuilding dependencies look here
https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Upgrading_GCC
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/165105/packages-to-rebuild-after-upgrading-gcc-on-gentoo-systems

and feel free to ask on IRC #gentoo and the forums.

Please report about your results.

Actually, I was referring to problems with gcc-4.9.3 going to gcc-4.9.4 linking in debug info when using -frecord-gcc-switches, which is not officially supported AFAIK.
I have rebuilt my system and have gotten 80 additional build failures, some of which I suspect are due to packages moving things around.
The biggest seems to be a bug with ghostscript which affects many packages.
I will, of course, be submitting additional reports as time permits.

As for facter, it rebuilds correctly with gcc-5.4.0-r3.
So, it seems that if you can't get the bug fixed in the gcc or facter package, you could just mask gcc-4.9 when using a newer boost.
