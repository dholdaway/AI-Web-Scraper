 Inside Lilly Eli Co's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
We expect that these actions may intensify and could particularly affect certain products, which could adversely affect our business.



 Financial - Expense   Highlight
These factors include cost and wage inflation, availability of adequate capacity in global transportation, supply chain and labor market complexities, international tension and conflicts, uneven economic growth or downturns or uncertainty, and an increase in overall demand in our industry for certain products and materials.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
As of December 31, 2023, a 5 percent change in the amount of uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of $88.7 million and $45.7 million, respectively.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
We have experienced and continue to expect intermittent delays fulfilling orders of certain Mounjaro doses given significant demand, which has affected and is expected to continue to affect volume.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate expense or aggregate milestone payments made could be material to our results of operations or cash flows, respectively, in that period.
