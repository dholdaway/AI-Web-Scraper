Description

The syslog-ng init script defines a conditional dependency on "net", whenever it detects that syslog-ng is configured to log network events (sources/destinations that contain tcp/udp). While this makes perfect sense for environments with fixed connections, it prevents the startup of the logging service for others, using transient connections (or in my case, simply forget to plug in the network cable). Since syslog-ng starts without "net", even when configured to log network events, I think the conditional dependency should be removed. Having no syslog daemon is worse than having one that cannot log network events, that will never happen. :)

Set RC_NET_STRICT_CHECKING to "lo" in /etc/conf.d/rc if you don't care whether syslog-ng will log correctly or not.
