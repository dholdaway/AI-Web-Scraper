Dropped ppc due to insufficient deps. Thanks.

I don't see it/them:

jeroen@astrid /keeps/gentoo/cvs/gentoo-x86/net-analyzer/munin $ ekeyword ~ppc munin-1.4.3.ebuild && repofull 
munin-1.4.3.ebuild
  -KEYWORDS="~amd64 ~mips ~sparc ~x86"
  +KEYWORDS="~amd64 ~mips ~ppc ~sparc ~x86"

RepoMan scours the neighborhood...
  upstream.workaround           3
   net-analyzer/munin/munin-1.4.3.ebuild: Upstream parallel compilation bug (ebuild calls emake -j1 on line: 70)
   net-analyzer/munin/munin-1.4.3.ebuild: Upstream parallel compilation bug (ebuild calls emake -j1 on line: 72)
   net-analyzer/munin/munin-1.4.3.ebuild: Upstream parallel compilation bug (ebuild calls emake -j1 on line: 96)

Note: use --include-dev (-d) to check dependencies for 'dev' profiles

RepoMan sez: "You're only giving me a partial QA payment?
              I'll take it this time, but I'm not happy."

The only new dep wrt 1.3.* seems to be dev-perl/Log-Log4perl which is keyworded for ppc already.

I'm not sure why repoman complained to me. Sorry, and thanks Jeroen.
