After upgrading dev-libs/icu from version 4.2.1 to 4.4.1, Firebird doesn't start anymore.
Back to icu-4.2.1, Firebird starts again.

Hello Vincent,

unfortunately this package has no maintainer.

Can you please start firbird from a console to see any error output during the startup?

Have you tried rebuilding firebird after the icu update?

Can you please test if `revdep-rebuild --ignore` can resolve all broken links i.e. by rebuilding fireid)?

Michael

I've rebuilt Firebird and everything is back to normal.
Thanks.
