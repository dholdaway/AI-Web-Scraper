When I login as known local user vsftpd is edning up to the same place the anon users gtting in to. where the local uswer login has worked fine before have the latest 3-4 version not worked as it should for local user login.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.login as local user respons can not in chroot() and ends with error.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
With local login is I ending up in path /home/ftp/ og getting error by can't change directory in chroot()

Expected Results:  
Latest versions of Vsftpd should by local user login like users as (kofo, web and www) have login my in to the path of /home/kofo and /home/www

Not sure what your problem is. 

Is it:
1: You cant get any local user to login?
2: You want the ftp user to be a proper user?

Please post your config since it might be relevant.

vsftpd 2.3.4 works, in 2.3.5 it does not

also noted that on opensuse 12.2 ftp have /bin/bash shell

just to make it insecure now :(

try build without pam

the Gentoo self signed ssl certs is a different issue and not related to vsftpd. I  still don't understand what is wrong with the vsftpd package.

Not clear what's pending here and since local logins work for me I am closing this bug
