  Clear Secure, Inc. | Q4 2023 |  Page 6 Shareholder Letter Q4 2023 Dear Shareholder, 2023 Review Our 2023 financial performance was strong. Revenues grew 40%, Total Bookings grew 35%, and  Members grew 31%. CLEAR achieved the AND—growth, margin expansion and strong Free Cash Flow.  Operating margins expanded by over 1,300 basis points1, we generated $225 million of Operating  Cash Flow and $200 million of Free Cash Flow, up 46% year-over-year. Cash and cash equivalents  ended the year at $728 million after returning significant capital to shareholders in the form of share  repurchases (~$70 million) and dividends (totalling $0.91 per share). Over 20 million Members are now on the CLEAR platform and can access our growing network of use  cases with just a selfie. In travel, CLEAR Plus is in 56 airports with 147 Lanes nationally and 20  RESERVE locations globally. CLEAR Verified continues to add new partners in healthcare, financial  services, and digital marketplaces such as LinkedIn. The power of CLEAR’s trusted identity platform is the ability to enroll once and use everywhere.   Our network effect strengthens as we expand our Members, nodes, and use cases. It bears  repeating—identity is foundational. Reusable identity enables seamless and secure experiences   for our Members and for our partners. CLEAR Travel CLEAR’s 2023 financial performance and network expansion were strong but the CLEAR Plus  Member experience was not consistently up to our standards. In 2024, we are fixing the  experience—restoring the frictionless journey that travelers have come to expect. Throughout this  year the CLEAR Lane of the Future will be rolling out, enabled by NextGen Identity+, ensuring  scalability, security, and predictability. Our new operating system optimizes CLEAR Pods for speed, while new Ambassador handheld  devices are streamlining manual processes, enhancing both security and efficiency. In the coming  months, we will transition to face first for an even faster Member experience. With NextGen Identity+, a universal, standardized digital identity, CLEAR is interoperable. A universal  identity is critical as travel is highly fragmented—encompassing different ticketing platforms,   airlines, and airports. Travel is hard and travelers appreciate the consistency of CLEAR—ensuring   a predictable journey regardless of where, when or how they fly. Travel continues to grow—the U.S. Travel Association forecasts a 3% increase in air travel for 2024— that means 26 million more passengers through checkpoints this year. With CLEAR Plus, RESERVE,  and TSA PreCheck® Enrollment Provided by CLEAR, we are building new products and expanding our  footprint to meet this demand. Whether you travel once a year or once a week, CLEAR’s friction-free  and predictable experiences are for all travelers. We are actively launching TSA PreCheck® Enrollment Provided by CLEAR—both online renewals and  in person enrollment. There is enormous opportunity with this program and we are bringing it to all  1  Excluding items called out in the financial release. 

 




  Clear Secure, Inc. | Q4 2023 |  Page 7 Shareholder Letter Q4 2023 travelers with greater convenience and choice of where, when, and how to sign up. More travelers  want to be part of TSA PreCheck® and for $1.30/month we think that all U.S. travelers should have it. Today, consumers can renew TSA PreCheck® with CLEAR online and new applicants can simply   walk up to CLEAR’s dedicated TSA PreCheck® enrollment pods at Newark Liberty International  Airport (our first location) and enroll in minutes—no appointment necessary. Starting with our airport  network, staffed around the clock by our 3,700 Ambassadors, we look forward to expanding access  to all travelers for this essential program, pending TSA approval. CLEAR Verified Identity used to be built in the physical world with a firm handshake and the exchange of   a business card. More of our daily life is now online and the need to seamlessly prove who we are   in this digital world is a here and now problem. CLEAR is uniquely positioned to become the   trusted identity layer of the internet. The CLEAR Verified platform took a great step forward with the integration of Sora ID (CLEAR’s   Know Your Customer solution). We now offer an end-to-end, fully configurable identity solution that  enables partners to truly know their customers without introducing friction.  The CLEAR Verified platform is live with partners, ranging from digital marketplaces to medical   record access, to car and apartment rental. There is strong overlap between the expanding   CLEAR Member base and our partners' customers. Today this means over 20 million Members can  verify or enroll seamlessly with CLEAR Verified partners—increasing adoption, driving customer  loyalty, and improving partners’ bottom line. Importantly, CLEAR is known for trust and security. LinkedIn recently conducted a Trust Experience  Survey that found that verification via CLEAR has driven high member satisfaction (75%) and   that verified members associate ID verification with higher confidence in assessing authenticity   of other members.

We saw a continuation of the strong travel  trends driving membership growth, leading to better than expected Total Bookings growth. Fourth quarter 2023 Total Cumulative Enrollments reached 20.2 million, driven by an increase in  CLEAR Plus enrollments at existing and new airports, as well as growth of CLEAR Verified enrollments. Fourth quarter 2023 Active CLEAR Plus Members reached 6.7 million, up 23.4% as compared to the  fourth quarter of 2022 driven by new Members added through airport, partner and organic channels  in existing and new markets. Fourth quarter 2023 Total Cumulative Platform Uses reached 180.8 million, driven primarily by the  continued strength in air travel leading to increases in CLEAR Plus verifications. Fourth quarter 2023 Annualized CLEAR Plus Member Usage was 8.1x, down 5.8% as compared to  the fourth quarter of 2022. Fourth quarter 2023 Annual CLEAR Plus Net Member Retention was 86.3%, down 560 basis points  year-over-year and down 220 basis points sequentially.  Cost of revenue share fee was $25.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and includes a COVID- related benefit of $(0.4) million. Excluding COVID-related benefits in all periods, Cost of revenue  share fee as a percentage of revenue was up 64 basis points year-over-year and down 10 basis  points sequentially. Cost of revenue share fee percentage may vary by quarter, but on an annual  basis we expect it to remain relatively stable over time. Cost of direct salaries and benefits was $40.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and includes   a benefit of $(0.4) million of non-cash equity-based compensation reversal relating to pre-IPO  employee performance award units, approximately $2.0 million of surge staffing related to NextGen  Identity+ upgrades and $0.1 million of severance. Excluding the pre-IPO employee performance  award reversal, surge staffing and severance as well as previously disclosed prior-period non-cash  items, cost of direct salaries and benefits expense of $38.5 million was up 30.5% year-over-year, and  up 9.1% sequentially; as a percentage of revenue it was down 49 basis points year-over-year and up  51 basis points sequentially. We expect cost of direct salaries and benefits in 2024 to decline as a  percentage of revenues on a full year basis versus 2023. Research and development expense of $18.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 includes a benefit  of $(3.6) million of non-cash equity-based compensation reversal relating to pre-IPO employee  performance award units, a benefit of $(1.4) million of non-cash equity-based compensation reversal  from departed team members, a $1.3 million write-off related to legacy software and $1.5 million of  severance expense.

  Clear Secure, Inc. | Q4 2023 |  Page 14 Shareholder Letter Q4 2023 To evaluate performance of the business, we utilize a variety of other non-GAAP financial reporting  and performance measures. These key measures include Total Bookings, Total Cumulative  Enrollments, Total Cumulative Platform Uses, Annual CLEAR Plus Net Member Retention, Active  CLEAR Plus Members, and Annual CLEAR Plus Member Usage. Total Bookings Total Bookings represent our total revenue plus the change in deferred revenue during the period.  Total Bookings in any particular period reflect sales to new and renewing CLEAR Plus subscribers  plus any accrued billings to partners. Management believes that Total Bookings is an important  measure of the current health and growth of the business and views it as a leading indicator. Total Cumulative Enrollments We define Total Cumulative Enrollments as the number of enrollments since inception as of the end  of the period. An Enrollment is defined as any Member who has registered for the CLEAR platform  since inception and has a profile (including limited time free trials regardless of conversion to paid  membership) net of duplicate and/or purged accounts. This includes CLEAR Plus Members who have  completed enrollment with CLEAR and have ever activated a payment method, plus associated family  accounts. Management views this metric as an important tool to analyze the efficacy of our growth  and marketing initiatives as new Members are potentially a current and leading indicator of revenues. Total Cumulative Platform Uses We define Total Cumulative Platform Uses as the number of individual engagements across CLEAR  use cases, including CLEAR Plus, our flagship app and CLEAR Verified, since inception as of the end  of the period. Management views this metric as an important tool to analyze the level of engagement  of our Member base which can be a leading indicator of future growth, retention and revenue. Annual CLEAR Plus Net Member Retention We define Annual CLEAR Plus Net Member Retention as one minus the CLEAR Plus net Member  churn on a rolling 12 month basis. We define “CLEAR Plus net Member churn” as total cancellations  net of winbacks in the trailing 12 month period divided by the average active CLEAR Plus Members as  of the beginning of each month within the same 12 month period. Winbacks are defined as  reactivated Members who have been cancelled for at least 60 days. Active CLEAR Plus Members are  defined as Members who have completed enrollment with CLEAR and have activated a payment  method for our in-airport CLEAR Plus service, including their registered family plan Members. Active  CLEAR Plus Members also include those in a grace period of up to 45 days after a billing failure  during which time we attempt to collect updated payment information. Management views this  metric as an important tool to analyze the level of engagement of our Member base, which can be a  leading indicator of future growth and revenue, as well as an indicator of customer satisfaction and  long term business economics. Definitions of Key Performance Indicators 

 




  Clear Secure, Inc. | Q4 2023 |  Page 15 Shareholder Letter Q4 2023 In addition to our results as determined in accordance with GAAP, we disclose Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Common  Share, Diluted as non-GAAP financial measures that management believes provide useful information  to investors. These measures are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and  should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss), or any other operating performance  measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure  reported by other companies. Our Non-GAAP financial measures are expressed in thousands. We periodically reassess the components of our Non-GAAP adjustments for changes in how we  evaluate our performance and changes in how we make financial and operational decisions to ensure  the adjustments remain relevant and meaningful. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for income taxes, interest (income)  expense net, depreciation and amortization, impairment and losses on asset disposals, equity-based  compensation expense, mark to market of warrant liabilities, net other income (expense) excluding  sublease rental income, acquisition-related costs and changes in fair value of contingent  consideration. Adjusted EBITDA is an important financial measure used by management and our  board of directors (“Board”) to evaluate business performance. During the third quarter of fiscal year  2022, we revised our definition of Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) to exclude sublease rental income from our  other income (expense) adjustment. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, we revised our  Non-GAAP Financial Measures Active CLEAR Plus Members We define Active CLEAR Plus Members as the number of Members with an active CLEAR Plus  subscription as of the end of the period. This includes CLEAR Plus Members who have an activated  payment method, plus associated family accounts and is inclusive of Members who are in a limited  time free trial; it excludes duplicate and/or purged accounts. Management views this as an important  tool to measure the growth of its CLEAR Plus product. Annual CLEAR Plus Member Usage We define Annual CLEAR Plus Member Usage as the total number of unique CLEAR Plus airport  verifications in the 365 days prior to the end of the period divided by active CLEAR Plus Members as  of the end of the period who have been enrolled for at least 365 days. The numerator includes only  verifications of the population in the denominator. Management views this as an important tool to  analyze the level of engagement of our active CLEAR Plus Member base.

  Clear Secure, Inc. | Q4 2023 |  Page 16 Shareholder Letter Q4 2023 definition of Adjusted EBITDA to include impairment on assets as a separate component. We did not  revise prior years' Adjusted EBITDA because there was no impact of a similar nature in the prior period  that affects comparability. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is Adjusted EBITDA, divided by total revenues. Adjusted Net Income We define Adjusted Net Income as Net income (loss) attributable to Clear Secure, Inc. adjusted for  the net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, equity-based compensation expense,  amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition related costs, changes in fair value of  contingent consideration and the income tax effect of these adjustments. Adjusted Net Income is  used in the calculation of Adjusted Net Income per Common Share as defined below. Adjusted Net Income per Common Share We compute Adjusted Net Income per Common Share, Basic as Adjusted Net Income divided by  Adjusted Weighted-Average Shares Outstanding for our Class A Common Stock, Class B Common  Stock, Class C Common Stock and Class D Common Stock assuming the exchange of all vested and  outstanding common units in Alclear at the end of each period presented. We do not present  Adjusted Net Income per Common Share for shares of our Class B Common Stock although they are  participating securities based on the assumed conversion of those shares to our Class A Common  Stock. We do not present Adjusted Net Income per Common Share on a dilutive basis for periods  where we have Adjusted Net Loss since we do not assume the conversion of any potentially dilutive  equity instruments as the result would be anti-dilutive. In periods where we have Adjusted Net  Income, the Company also calculates Adjusted Net Income per Common Share, Diluted based on the  effect of potentially dilutive equity instruments for the periods presented using the treasury stock/ if-converted method, as applicable. Adjusted Net Income per Common Share is only applicable for  periods after June 29, 2021, post the Reorganization Transactions and IPO. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Common Share exclude, to the extent applicable,  exclude the tax effected impact of non-cash expenses and other items that are not directly related to  our core operations. These items are excluded because they are connected to the Company’s long  term growth plan and not intended to increase short term revenue in a specific period. Further, to the  extent that other companies use similar methods in calculating non-GAAP measures, the provision of  supplemental non-GAAP information can allow for a comparison of the company’s relative  performance against other companies that also report non-GAAP operating results. Free Cash Flow We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities adjusted for  purchases of property and equipment plus the value of share repurchases over fair value.   With regards to our CLEAR Plus subscription service, we generally collect cash from our Members  upfront for annual subscriptions. As a result, when the business is growing Free Cash Flow can be   a real time indicator of the current trajectory of the business.

 Inside Clear Secure, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Expense   Highlight
As we grow our market penetration, the cost to acquire new Members could increase and the experience we deliver to Members could degrade, causing lower retention rates.



 Other - Other   Highlight
In addition, the Credit Agreement contains certain other covenants (none of which relate to financial condition), events of default and other customary provisions.

 Financial - Dividend   Highlight
The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, such as financial statement reporting requirements and delivery of borrowing base certificates, as well as customary covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, sell certain assets, guarantee obligations of third parties, declare dividends or make certain distributions, and undergo a merger or consolidation or certain other transactions.

 Other - Other   Highlight
These statements are based upon assumptions that we have made in light of our experience in the industry, as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe are appropriate under the circumstances.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
We expect to incur additional expenses related to these steps and, among other things, additional directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, director fees, reporting requirements of the SEC, transfer agent fees, hiring additional accounting, legal and administrative personnel, increased auditing and legal fees and similar expenses.
