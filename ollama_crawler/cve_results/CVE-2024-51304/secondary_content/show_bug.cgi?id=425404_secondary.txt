Please rebuild libav/ffmpeg (whatever of the two you're using) with revdep-rebuild, the x264 updates almost constantly change their ABI signatures.

Turns out revdep reported no files needed updating,so I resync'd the noticed that transcode had been updated to 1.1.7-r1 ,which compiled up fine.
Thanks for the info
