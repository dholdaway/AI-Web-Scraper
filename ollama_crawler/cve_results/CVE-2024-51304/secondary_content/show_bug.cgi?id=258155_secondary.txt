Description

Portage: 2.1.6.4
Emerge: coreutils-6.10-r2
Reason:
   Coreutils, at the end of the emerge tries to install some man-pages.  The man pages already exist, and with portage 2.1.6.4, "protect-owned" is enabled by default.  because the files already exist, and are owned my "man-pages-2.42" the whole emerge fails.  The man pages are in "/usr/share/man/man1/<name>.1.bz2", where <name>: is any of the following:

chgrp, chmod, chown, cp, dd, df, dir, dircolors, install, ln, ls, mkdir, mkfifo, mknod, rm, rmdir, touch, vdir

It has been reproduced more than once with exactly the same output.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.emerge -av coreutils
2.type "yes"
3.wait

Actual Results:  
The build process worked, but emerging failed due to file collisions.

Expected Results:  
I expected the package to merge properly, and it did not, but not due to a build reason.

Deleting the current copies of the files is a kludgy workaround, but the whole process results in a loss of productivity.

Thank you for your help !  I love Gentoo !

man-pages-2.42 is crazy old.  upgrade it.
