Please add your emerge --info as a comment to this bug.

Expression 'stream->capture.pcm' failed in 'src/hostapi/alsa/pa_linux_alsa.c',
This seems to be related to pulseaudio.

I can't reproduce this with 1.3.13. Feel free to reopen with more info if you can.

Also just to note, pa in this case relates to portaudio not pulseaudio.
