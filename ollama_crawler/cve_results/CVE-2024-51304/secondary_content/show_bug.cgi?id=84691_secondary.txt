I typed in this:

webapp-config -I -p mediawiki 1.3.11

and now I have mediawiki install in /var/www/localhost/htdocs/mediawiki

Reproducible: Didn't try
Steps to Reproduce:



Expected Results:  
It should have told me what it would have done, then exited.

Hi,

I can't reproduce this bug at all.  Are you sure that mediawiki wasn't already 
installed before you ran webapp-config?

Best regards,
Stu
