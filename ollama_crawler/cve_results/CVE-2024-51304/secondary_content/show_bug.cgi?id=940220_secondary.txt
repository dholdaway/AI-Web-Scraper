For a while spectacle instantly recognized QR codes when screenshotting and showed their text.

It currently isn't working.

It is linked to zxing-cpp libraries.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Take screenshot of QR code with spectacle

Actual Results:  
Screenshot is taken, no decode of QR code is presented

Expected Results:  
Show contents of QR code

Can you please be more specific?

Works for me with:
media-libs/zxing-cpp-2.2.1
kde-frameworks/prison-6.6.0
kde-apps/spectacle-24.08.1

...or maybe you can attach an example qrcode that's not working for you? right now I can't reproduce your problem.

Hi,

any QR code, but I'll attach one.

Same versions. Already rebuild zxing and spectacle. Not finding anything in the settings.

Maybe it's related to the other issue I'm having. I mostly store temporary files under /tmp. Storing PNG's there and opening it with dolphin makes it endlessly loop creating thumbnails of the thumbnails. Yesterday had a time it didn't occur, but seems to occur most of the times.

Not sure if I should file upstream if you can't reproduce

Maybe don't do that for a bit, and check if spectacle behaves differently.

Or, as I suggested yesterday already, try to reproduce this with a clean testuser profile. First, without your habit of using /tmp, then going about it as usual.

Works fine with a new test user. Must be something in the profile somewhere.

Any output when you start spectacle from konsole, maybe?
