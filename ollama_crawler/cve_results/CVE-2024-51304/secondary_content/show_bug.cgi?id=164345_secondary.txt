eclipse-sdk-3.2.1-r1 fails to emerge with errors in the apply_patchset function. Specifically, the eclipse-sdk-3.2.1-r1-build.patch fails to apply. 

Patches attached.

Updated patch that applies cleanly to the eclipse source

This is an updated version of the original eclipse-sdk-3.2.1-build.patch that doesn't apply cleanly to the eclipse sdk source.

k, never mind. the patch above is no longer needed for the build, since the latest addition to the ebuild after a resyncing to put portage back in ${WORKDIR} before applying patches has fixed it.
