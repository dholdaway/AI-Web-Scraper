 Inside Informatica Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Income   Highlight
The income tax provision has fluctuated in each of the prior eight quarters presented primarily due to seasonality of the pretax income or losses incurred throughout the years, an increase in our valuation allowance and to a lesser extent from foreign income taxed at different rates and non-deductible stock based compensation.



 Other - Other   Highlight
In addition, we may be obligated to pay certain variable and deferred earn-out payments based upon achievement of certain performance targets.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
Under this method, income tax expense or benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for

 Financial - Debt   Highlight
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $38.8 million driven by proceeds from issuance of common stock under the ESPP, proceeds from issuance of shares and net activity from derivatives with an other-than-insignificant financing element, offset by payment of debt and payment of offering costs.

 M & A - Other   Highlight
