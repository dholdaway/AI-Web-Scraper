I've talked with some of my co-translaters about marking old outdated translated docs. One of them told me, that there already is such a field on the right panel obove the summary. I often used translated docs but I've never seen this field before. I didn't look at this right panel at all. So it might be better, to place the "document last translated at" at the top of the doc in big red blinking letters or something else that could not be oversight :)

Nah, we don't want many things up there as it would make users scroll past it all the time. It's in the best possible place now.

It makes perfect sense to display that note right below "last updated..."
You might prefer the printable version:
http://www.gentoo.org/doc/de/altinstall.xml?style=printable
or maybe my test site:
http://gentoo.neysx.org/doc/de/altinstall.xml

BTW, I just found out I could read German: "Originalversion" :)

hm, don't be so fast in closing this bug, this is something we should really talk about to make it better for all of us :)

There should not be many things on the top of the doc, only this 1 line telling the user, that this doc is outdated - no reason to scroll down. The right panel could  *not* be the best place, since this is a place where I do not look for information. Information for me starts at the headline and not somewhere on this right panel with names a normal user doesn't care about. In the printable version it is a bit better but I *never* look at the printed version since I don't need it. Even if I would look at it I'm not shure that i would recognize it- "alright names.. where are the headline... ah, here" 

I often heard from other users telling people "use the english version, translated version might be outdated", so this tells me that users do not know if it is up-to-date, altough this tag exists. I also never heard something about "look at the date tag, to be sure it is up-to-date". The people aktually do not know if it is outdated or not. I'm a translater but I didn't know that this tag exists 2 days ago - so this could definitly *not* a good place to place such important information! 

I currently asked some users from a gentoo channel (10 minutes ago) "do you know this last-transaled tag?"  answer: "ahm, no... ".. After that I gave him a link "search for it" answer: "ahmm,, *hm*... updated on 2.2.2006?" .. this would say it all I think.

There simply should be an eyecatcher - whereever it might be. The point is, there must be something that tells me "ey watch out, this is outdated!", whereever this place might be, but it has to be somewhere I will see it, even if I don't know that this tag exists somewhere on the document. 

So *really* think about this, ask some users if they know this tag, or where it should be to get recognized

Like Xavier wrote, the best place for it is just under the "last updated" information. Both texts will be moved to the top of docs with redesign, so be patient. :-)

of course, it makes sense to place it under "last updated", the problem for me is (or was, if you really plan to change the placemant of the 2 info blocks) that at the current position it doesn't get recognised. 

alright, let's see where it is placed in the future. I hope that this redesign would happen soon :-)
