It's already in tree?  I released it a few hours after they did upstream.

     Available versions:  1.9.4^t{tbz2} 1.9.6^t{tbz2} ~2.0.2.0-r1^t ~2.1.0.0^t **9999 {keyczar test PYTHON_TARGETS="python2_7"}

Sorry, my mistake. I thought that it's another sub-release.

It was no problem, they do things oddly (upstream)
