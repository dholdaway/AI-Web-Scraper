Exhibit 99.1

 



 Charles River Laboratories Announces Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2023 Results and Provides 2024 Guidance 

 – Fourth-Quarter Revenue of $1.01 Billion and Full-Year Revenue of $4.13 Billion – 
 – Fourth-Quarter GAAP Earnings per Share of $3.62 and Non-GAAP Earnings per Share of $2.46 – 
 – Full-Year GAAP Earnings per Share of $9.22 and Non-GAAP Earnings per Share of $10.67 – 
 – Provides 2024 Guidance – 



WILMINGTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 14, 2024--Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. (NYSE: CRL) today reported its results for the fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 and provided guidance for 2024. For the quarter, revenue was
            $1.01 billion, a decrease of 7.9% from $1.10 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022. 
 The impact of foreign currency translation benefited reported revenue by 1.2%, and acquisitions contributed 0.7% to consolidated fourth-quarter revenue. The addition of a 53rd week at the end of 2022, which is periodically required
            to align to a December 31st calendar year end, reduced reported revenue growth by approximately 4.7%, and the divestiture of the Avian Vaccine business in December 2022 reduced reported revenue by 1.6%. Excluding the effect of these
            items, organic revenue decreased 3.5%. On a segment basis, revenue increased in the Manufacturing segment on an organic basis, but was offset by lower revenue in the Discovery and Safety Assessment (DSA) and the Research Models and Services
            (RMS) business segments. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2023, the GAAP operating margin decreased to 13.1% from 14.9% in the fourth quarter of 2022, and on a non-GAAP basis, the operating margin decreased to 19.1% from 20.4%. The GAAP and non-GAAP decreases were primarily
            driven by higher unallocated corporate costs. 
 On a GAAP basis, fourth-quarter net income attributable to common shareholders was $187.1 million, a decrease of 0.2% from $187.4 million for the same period in 2022. Fourth-quarter diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis were $3.62, a
            decrease of 0.8% from $3.65 for the fourth quarter of 2022. Lower GAAP net income and earnings per share were driven primarily by lower revenue and operating income. GAAP earnings per share included gains on certain venture capital and other
            strategic investments of $2.04 per share in the fourth quarter of 2023, which included a gain on our original strategic investment in Noveprim Group. This compares to a loss of $0.13 per share on certain venture capital and other strategic
            investments for the same period in 2022. The GAAP gain related to the Noveprim investment in 2023 was more than offset by a prior-year gain on the sale of the Avian Vaccine business in the fourth quarter of 2022. 


The following information was filed by Charles River Laboratories International Inc (CRL) on Wednesday, February 14, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.
