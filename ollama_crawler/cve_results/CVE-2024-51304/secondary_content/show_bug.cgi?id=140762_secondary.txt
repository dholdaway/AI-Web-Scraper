The imapsync ebuild 1.171-r1 fails (tested on amd64; failed dependencies) and requires at least the following to complete successfully:
# emerge g-cpan
# g-cpan -i Term-ReadKey
# g-cpan -i Net-SSLeay
# emerge imapsync

Also, version bump request for imapsync 1.178 at http://www.linux-france.org/prj/imapsync/dist/

<snip>
DEPEND=">=dev-perl/Mail-IMAPClient-2.1.4"

RDEPEND="${DEPEND}
        perl-core/Digest-MD5
        dev-perl/Net-SSLeay
        perl-core/MIME-Base64
        dev-perl/TermReadKey
        dev-perl/Digest-HMAC"
</snip>

Run 'perl-cleaner all' - no missing deps there.
