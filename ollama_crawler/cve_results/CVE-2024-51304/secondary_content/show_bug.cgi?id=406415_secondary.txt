Description

When package is emerged, it dumps LC_MESSAGES for many languages, whereas I have the line 'LINGUAS="en"' in make.conf.

Actual Results:
LC_MESSAGES contains unwanted files

Expected Results:
LC_MESSAGES should contain only files for selected LINGUAS


/usr/share/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/gnono.mo
/usr/share/locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES/gnono.mo
/usr/share/locale/nl/LC_MESSAGES/gnono.mo

I can't reproduce this without completely unsetting LINGUAS.  If it's set correct to something in make.conf the locale files install as expected.
