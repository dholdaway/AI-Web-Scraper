The LVM loading block in /etc/init.d/checkfs init script should be after softraid init block - otherwise it won't work when doing an LVM over softraid.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Build system with LVM over softraid mirror as instructed in http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Gentoo_Install_on_Software_RAID_mirror_and_LVM2_on_top_of_RAID
2. Reboot the system after installation


Actual Results:  
Won't load LVM properly.

Expected Results:  
Init softraid and LVM properly.

You did not post emerge --info like you were supposed to. Which version of baselayout do you have?
