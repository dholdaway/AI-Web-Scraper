q outputs colors under many conditions. However, when the terminal doesn't support colors, and when stdout is not a tty, q should not output colors, even if the -C flag isn't specified.

Reproducible: Always

that means using and linking against ncurses, neither of which i want to do

the whole point of -C is to *disable* colors, not enable, so i dont really understand the last part of your statement

i dont really like this kind of auto-magic detection, plus we cant really do it cleanly without pulling in deps, plus i like having color when piping into less
