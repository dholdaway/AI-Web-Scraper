Description

          2011-12-22 10:02:37 UTC
        

The error message occurred during the first time if I emerge dev-java/oracle-jdk-bin-1.7.0.1-r2, on multiple computers at the same package. Since the error messages appear on every emerge. Downgrade to dev-java/oracle-jdk-bin-1.7.0.1-r1 does not help.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
Error messages appears.

What's the content of /etc/sandbox.d/20oracle-jdk-bin-1.7?

on 2 computers:
SANDBOX_PREDICT="/dev/random:/proc/self/coredump_filter"

on 3 computers:
SANDBOX_PREDICT="/dev/random /proc/self/coredump_filter"

After a new emerge-webrsync I have upgraded portage to version 2.1.10.41 and the error seems to be gone on all 5 computers!

This would explain the issue.

The error went away without reinstalling oracle-jdk-bin?

Yes, without reinstalling oracle-jdk-bin, and I have tested before with ":" but without success.

Guess it won't easily be possible anymore to figure out what happened and chances are high it's not related to oracle-jdk-bin but a sandbox glich.

Closing. If someone runs into the same issue please reopen or file a new bug referencing this one.

Hope this is fine with you.
