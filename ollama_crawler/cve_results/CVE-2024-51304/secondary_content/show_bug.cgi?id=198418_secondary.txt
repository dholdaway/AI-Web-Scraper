It would be highly desirable to have the ability to turn off/on DISTCCD, CCACHE and optionaly modify the make "-jx" switch from the same command line that evokes emerge...

Something like: DISTCCD=off CCACHE=off MAKEJ="1" emerge some-package
or
Something like: DISTCCD=on CCACHE=on MAKEJ="20" emerge-somepackage

Would be nice.


Reproducible: Always

> Something like: DISTCCD=off CCACHE=off MAKEJ="1" emerge some-package

And what's exactly wrong w/ `FEATURES="-distcc -ccache" MAKEOPTS="-j1" emerge foo` ?
