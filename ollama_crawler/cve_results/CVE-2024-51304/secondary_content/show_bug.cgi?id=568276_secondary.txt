Description

Compiling apache-2.4.16 with the "autoindex" USE-flag set results in the creation of modules/mod_autoindex.so.

However, there is no proposed change to the file /etc/apache/httpd.conf file, and this module does not get loaded..

Manually adding this line to /etc/apache/httpd.conf will work, and I believe it should be offered to the user as a ._cfg000 configuration update:

LoadModule autoindex_module modules/mod_autoindex.so

After adding this line to httpd.conf and restarting apache-2.4, my desired behaviour (listing of files) works as-expected.

Hello Gordon, just tested 2.4.18 and it works just fine, it was added automatically. Have you modified httpd.conf prior to re-merging apache? Please post your emerge --info www-servers/apache and please give a try to 2.4.18 if it works correctly for you.

Hello, Tomáš:

I am not really sure how to respond at this time, but I will start by saying "Thank-you" for looking into this issue.

I am uncertain because:

-I notice that on the same day I reported this issue, a newer version of Apache (2.4.18) was released.  My issue may therefore be irrelevant.

-Your test-install was for a different version than that for which the bug was filed.  It may be possible that your different version would show me a path forward, and I an grateful for your good intentions.

-My issue was that a proposed ._cfg000 update was not provided.  It may be helpful, in other circumstances, to know that your test does provide a correct httpd.conf for a fresh install.


You asked if I had modified my httpd.conf.  Yes.  At the very least, ServerName has been set, and any other changes would be few, and lost in the mists of time (this basic server existed on a standalone box from around 2001, has been migrated to a Linux-Vserver guest, and now resides on a QEMU/kvm guest... there would surely have been some adjustments over the course of 15yrs!).

Thank-you,

Hello Gordon,
are you sure you are setting ServerName in httpd.conf? I manage a few apache instances but honestly I don't remember ever touching httpd.conf, most work is done in vhosts directory.

Is this still an issue with apache-2.4.18 package?

I cannot say... I haven't performed a new, 'tabula rasa' install of Apache for a little while now, and it will be rare to require "autoindex" for me.  I shall have to leave your question, Lars, for someone else who can perform a completely-fresh installation and respond.

Thank-you,

Please reopen if you can reproduce this. Closing for now.
