Hi
I'd like to request the addition of unicode-start in the baselayout (bashrc, $whatever). Thanks to the documented 'UNICODE="yes"' in rc.conf it should be quite easy to determine if the user runs utf8.
It would be much easier for most users if the console-layout would be corrected by default, without the need to run unicode_start (which changes the consolefont as well, if you don't specify a different one).
Also, one line in rc.conf mentioning unicde-capable consolefonts (I'm using lat9u-16) would be really helpful.  Since I already set an utf8-capable consolefont in rc.conf, I only need this echo -n -e '\033%G' to be run.
Might be a good idea to do this when bash3 gets marked stable. Or myabe you already have different plans :)

if you read init.d/keymaps you'll see that 033%G is already passed to the terminal

as for consolefonts, there is /etc/conf.d/consolefonts, but it looks like when i made the 1.11.9 release, my cvs was missing that file ... it'll be part of 1.11.10 for sure

baselayout-1.9.4-r6:
$ grep 033 /etc/init.d/keymaps 
$

Only match for 033 is in init.d/consolefont, but not the 033 I'm looking for.
echo -ne "\033(K".
I guess the updated keymaps is still in the ~x86-branch.
