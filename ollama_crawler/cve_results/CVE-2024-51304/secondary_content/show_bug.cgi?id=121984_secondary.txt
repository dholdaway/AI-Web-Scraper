There's really two requests here.  I have been getting bug reports on packages that are marked -arch every now and then.  The problem is that users see that it is "grey" in packages.gentoo.org and try using it, not knowing that we have specifically set it -arch because it doesn't work and is known to not work.  Is there any way we can have some other indicator for packages that are either -arch or in an architecture's package.mask?

Reassigning to the main infra group since Marduk is retired.

New packages2 uses red to mask it off totally, but this is a problem with user education, not the site.
