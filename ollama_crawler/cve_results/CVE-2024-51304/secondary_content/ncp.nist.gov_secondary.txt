National Checklist Program

			The National Checklist Program (NCP), defined by the NIST
			SP 800-70, is the U.S. government repository of publicly available
			security checklists (or benchmarks) that provide detailed low level
			guidance on setting the security configuration of operating systems
			and applications.

			NCP supports the CCE Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE) list, the CCE Platform Listing.
		

NCP is migrating its repository of checklists to conform to the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). SCAP enables standards based security tools to automatically perform configuration checking using NCP checklists.
