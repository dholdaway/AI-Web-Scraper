 Inside Hashicorp, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Critical accounting estimates are accounting estimates where the nature of the estimates is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and the impact of the estimates on financial condition or operating performance is material.



 Other - Other   Highlight
We expect to maintain this full valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets for the foreseeable future as it is more likely than not that some or all of those deferred tax assets may not be realized based on our history of losses.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
Our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that are both most important to the portrayal of our net assets and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.

 M & A - Other   Highlight
Deferred contract acquisition costs include sales commissions earned by our sales force which are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer.
