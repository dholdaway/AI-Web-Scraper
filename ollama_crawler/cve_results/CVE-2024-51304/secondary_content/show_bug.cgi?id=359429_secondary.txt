Is it possible to change devfs to use the service modules so that devfs loads after udev and the modules are loaded? It is useful to do the load in the order of modules, udev, devfs because when devfs loads the splash screen loads. If the order is as I listed then it is easier to make it so uvesafb can be loaded depending on whether or not the system also has a KMS framebuffer. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Boot system

Actual Results:  
Load order is:
udev
devfs
modules

Expected Results:  
Loader order of would be nice:
modules
udev
devfs

neither has a hard dependency on the other.  if anything, they could be run in parallel most of the time.

if you have a hard order you want, then set it in your own conf.d file.  use the rc_need variable.

echo rc_need=modules > /etc/conf.d/devfs
