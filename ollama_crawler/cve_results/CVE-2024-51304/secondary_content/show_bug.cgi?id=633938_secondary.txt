mesa-17.2.2 doesnt compile. It stops during configuration

It seems, it llvm 3.3.0 or greate should be required, but llvm greater than 4.0.1 is installed.

Reproducible: Always

OK,

found the solution.

When another packaged was compiled, it shows that llvm was broken. So I recompiled llvm-5.0.0 and everything was fine.

For me, this bug is solved.
