Description

Created attachment 487528 [details]
build.log and emerge --info

This version fails to apply patch "xf86-video-virtualbox-5.1.4-Makefile.module.kms.patch"

The build log is very short, but of course will be attaching anyway.

Thank you!


M.

You might be able to just close this.  I upgraded the kernel to 4.12.5 and this successfully complied.  I was trying to get this to compile with 4.11.10 when I opened this bug.
