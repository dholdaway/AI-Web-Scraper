Created attachment 426586 [details, diff]
Patch adding the missing dependency.

Without it, emerging dies with:

    # emerge currvita
    ...
    >>> Install currvita-0.9i-r1 into /var/tmp/portage/dev-tex/currvita-0.9i-r1/image/ category dev-tex
     * Making documentation: ./cvtest.tex
     * ERROR: dev-tex/currvita-0.9i-r1::gentoo failed (install phase):
     *   (no error message)
     *
     * Call stack:

     *   environment, line 1429:  Called die
     * The specific snippet of code:
     *                       texi2dvi -q -c --language=latex $i &> /dev/null || die;
    ...

There are some notes from 2010 and 2011 about this sort of thing in an
automake context here [1].

I've filed a patch in GitHub [2], and have attached it here as well.

I haven't revbumped, because folks who were missing texi2dvi earlier
would not have been able to install the package with the older ebuild.

same reply as on github:

have you synced your tree recently ? it should try 'pdflatex' first there before texi2dvi, and I don't see the message that appears when pdflatex fails and it uses texi2dvi
