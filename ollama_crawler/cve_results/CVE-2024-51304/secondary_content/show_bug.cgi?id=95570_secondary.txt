Description

Launcing Point2Play produces the following error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/transgaming_point2play/Point2Play_gui.py", line 40, in ?
    raise Point2PlayError( _("Unable to load GUI components") + "(%s)" % str(
sys.exc_info()[1] ) )
__main__.Point2PlayError: 'Unable to load GUI components(No module named glade)'

And, as with the posts in the thread on the gentoo forums I posted, I have the
following merged (although some of them weren't merged when I first found my
problem).

[ebuild   R   ] dev-lang/python-2.3.5  +X +berkdb -bootstrap -build -debug

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Emerge the latest version of point2play
2.  Run Point2Play from the terminal to display errors
3.  Point2Play does not run.

Actual Results:  
Previously mentioned error spits out to the terminal.

Expected Results:  
Brought up the Point2Play gui.

It's a dependency problem, see bug 95573

I have P2P 2.0.1 working on my system, but as this bug exist as well as the
forum problem others are having problems
http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-346665.html

Now the main difference I can see is I have GNOME installed and that has pulled
in some python modules that P2P2.0.1 need (prolly via gnome-python). However,
gnome-python package is heavily GNOME-dependant


I have been enquiring at Transgaming forum and have this response

http://transgaming.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=17811#17811

They are talking abt a "python-glade2" package, but this is a debian package. It
does state that the majority of GNOME libs are not needed with that package, but
what is that package? prolly some sub-part of the Gentoo gnome-python.

Anyway just some info I have on this bug

sounds like a python upgrade issue

python ebuild warns about this during install

Yeah.  Its too bad that emerge doesn't have an option for defering printing of
einfo until after all packages have been merged.  This would eradicate most of
this type of bug report, because most of use just do a blind emerge -uDv world,
we don't have the time to merge packages individually.  

Maybe even if portage had an extra flag that would display when you do emerge
-uDpv world that would indicate that an ebuild could break another, and that you
should do it seperately, or at least set it to the last to build, so that einfo
is present in the scrollback buffer.
