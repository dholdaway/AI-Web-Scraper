This may be related to bug 406623 which appears to have been fixed in 3.6.2

yes, but as long as 3.4 is stable ...

(and I tried 3.6.2 and switched back to stale due to terrible/wrong timestamp jumps/bugs of 3.6.x

Right, I'm thinking maybe the other one should be reopened.  The rationale for closing it was "Unless some bug shows up, syslog-ng-3.6.1 will go stable in ~30 days." 

...and that was 90 days ago.  Or maybe this bug could convert into a stablereq with appropriate deps & blockers to keep track of things.

yes, threaded(yes) is a good default.  It is in fact enabled by default by upstream.

This is really the kind of thing that belongs in an email rather than a bug report.
