This has my vote of approval, with emphasis on the condition that the equipment 
is loaned, and if developer status changes the hardware is sent to someone 
else.

Corey:

That's the plan as outlined by the proposal.

I vote yay since it's a relatively small amount.  Ideally, we would get some
sort of status report X months after the purchase to explain how it has directly
led towards better video support in Gentoo.

I'll happily vote "aye" as well, although I think we should also consider asking
the manufacturers for sample versions of their products (in general, anyway, if
not necessarily in this particular case).  They'll probably say "no", since
sending one widget to each distro could get really pricey, but I can't see where
it would hurt to ask.

I'm not against purchaising, but did somebody ever asked the vendor or a local
dealer if they want to sponsor us with the hardware?




Comment 8


Chris White (RETIRED)

As per request I'm currently contacting the vendors to see if a hardware 
donation is possible.  If it is not, I will post a link to the email stating 
refusal.

Ok, the card is going to need to be purchased.  I wish I had a refusal email to  
go by, but it's been 1 full week without any form of vendor contact (not even a 
"we've recieved your email" sort of thing).  I'm contacting logitech today, 
since I finally have a weekday off and time to call them :P.

I'm fine with this...seems like it would be a worthwhile expendature. So
yeah...I vote yes.

It has my vote as well.

Sorry for being tardy, but I vote yay as well. Please keep us up-to-date on how
well the purchase has been!

Ok, this is good to go.  We'll have to do this from Netbank.  Grant, can you
send him a check for $62.58 please?

Thanks,

-C

Check sent (or, to be more precise, entered into netbank's online bill pay
system, so it may take 5-7 business days to receive it).




Comment 15

Check recieved on 8-02-2005 PDT (GMT-7) for $62.58. 
Intention to deposit on 8-03-2005. 
Intention to purchase equipment on 8-04-2005, allowing the check to go through 
properly.

Webcam purchased on 08-03-2005 at 4:34AM (yah  yah.. I know..) for $23.28. 
 
I'm going to have to wait till next friday for the video capture card 
unfortunately... it seems that newegg raised the price while I was waiting :|.  
It's now $41.99+$5 shipping :|. 
 
Corey, 
 
I need your information to stal* I mean.. send you a copy of the receipt for 
your records.

Capture card purchased at $50.02, same time as the webcam.  I just found out I   
had more money than I thought I did.  So that takes care of that business, now 
I sit and wait. 




Comment 19

Ok updates, I got the webcam, it's b0rk3d, maybe I'll try hacking the stupid  
thing or wait till logitech gets back to me.  
  
the video card, as a contridiction, works damn nice.  In fact, it  has a remote  
so I can bonusly work on lirc stuff :P.  So far I've got the fm tuner stuff  
working, all that took was a trip through /dev searching for device nodes until  
I found it.  Now I'm gonna play around with a couple of radio apps in  
media-sound to see what it's like.  I've already got a doc in my head :P.  
 
I also see the need for an lirc doc.  That's something that we definately need. 
 
Also, Corey will get the reciepts at LWE today, as I will see him there (well, 
I saw him yesterday, but didn't know I was going to see him yesterday).

Chris -- from what I overheard at LWE, my understanding is that the webcam is
broken.  Can you please advise us as to whether or not you've sent it back to
the vendor/company for replacement?  If you haven't yet sent it back, please
advise on a date that you plan to have it sent back by.




Comment 21


Chris White (RETIRED)






          2005-08-15 13:45:25 UTC
        

As far as the webcam, I'll probably re-imburse the foundation on my next 
paycheck.  It's gonna cost me more time/money/etc to get RMA's and return this 
thing that it would be to just give the money back.  I'll just have to hope for 
something better like this Logitech contact going through (still haven't heard 
back from them, I'll try later on today).

(moving this bug to the Foundation component) 
 
Chris, what's the latest on the webcam?

Chris, do you have an update on this?




Comment 24


Michael Cummings (RETIRED)






          2007-03-23 10:52:40 UTC
        

This should probably be closed if it relies on chris - he retired last year (but I think it was a quiet retirement - I've talked to him recently, and he said as much).

No clue how to resolve this, so WORKSFORME works for me.  ;]
