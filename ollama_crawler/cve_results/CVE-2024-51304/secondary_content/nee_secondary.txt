(NYSE: NEE) today reported 2023 fourth-quarter net income attributable to NextEra Energy on a GAAP basis of $1.210 billion, or $0.59 per share, compared to $1.522 billion, or $0.76 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2022. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy's 2023 fourth-quarter earnings were $1.067 billion, or $0.52 per share, compared to $1.011 billion, or $0.51 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2022.For the full year 2023, NextEra Energy reported net income attributable to NextEra Energy on a GAAP basis of $7.310 billion, or $3.60 per share, compared to $4.147 billion, or $2.10 per share, in 2022. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy's full-year 2023 earnings were $6.441 billion, or $3.17 per share, compared to $5.742 billion, or $2.90 per share, in 2022, which represents year-over-year growth in adjusted earnings per share of approximately 9.3%."NextEra Energy had an excellent year of execution in 2023, growing full-year adjusted earnings per share by more than 9% over 2022," said John Ketchum, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Due to strong operational and financial performance at both FPL and NextEra Energy Resources, we exceeded the high end of our adjusted earnings per share expectations range and continued our track record of providing long-term value for shareholders. FPL continues to deliver for its customers with a focus on keeping bills affordable, delivering exceptional reliability and executing its well-established capital plan. NextEra Energy Resources had its best-ever year of new renewables and storage origination, adding approximately 9,000 megawatts to its backlog. Given the strength of both businesses, we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in each year through 2026, while maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings."FPLFPL reported fourth-quarter 2023 net income on a GAAP basis of $1,146 million, or $0.56 per share, compared to $763 million, or $0.38 per share, for the prior-year quarter.

 Inside Nextera Energy Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Expense   Highlight
The inability of NEE, FPL and NEECH to maintain their current credit ratings could affect their ability to raise short- and long-term capital, their cost of capital and the execution of their respective financing strategies, and could require the posting of additional collateral under certain agreements.



 Other - Other   Highlight
Because the funds set aside by FPL for storm damage could be needed at any time, the related investments are generally more liquid and, therefore, are less sensitive to changes in interest rates.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
A ratings downgrade also could reduce the accessibility and increase the cost of commercial paper and other short-term debt issuances and borrowings and additional or replacement credit facilities.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Fuel, purchased power and interchange expense decreased $927 million in 2023 primarily related to lower fuel and energy prices.

 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
The first category, referred to as non-qualifying hedges, represents certain energy derivative, interest rate derivative and foreign currency transactions entered into as economic hedges, which do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting, or for which hedge accounting treatment is not elected or has been discontinued.
