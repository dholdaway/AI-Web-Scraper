Description

A simple "import gst" cause a segmentation fault with gst-python-0.10.5, this problem kills every gstreamer-based python apps (like quodlibet and listen for example)

python -v reports (part of interest):
import gst._gst # dynamically loaded from /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/gst-0.10/gst/_gst.so dlopen("/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/gst-0.10/gst/interfaces.so", 101);

Fortunately all works well with gst-python-0.10.6

So, what's exactly your problem? Use gst-python-0.10.6 then.

I only wanted to report this annoying problem to the other gentoo users that look their python apps die and report this issue to the devs.
That's all :)
