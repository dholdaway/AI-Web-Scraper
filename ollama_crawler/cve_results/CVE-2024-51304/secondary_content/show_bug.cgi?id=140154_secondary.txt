Description


Fabian Neumann





          2006-07-12 13:39:28 UTC
        

If you emerge last-exit and try to start it, you get the following error message:

Unhandled Exception: GConf.NoSuchKeyException: Key '/apps/lastexit/first_run' not found in GConf
in <0x000e1> GConf.Client:Get (System.String key)
in <0x0001a> LastExit.Config:get_FirstRun ()
in <0x000a8> LastExit.Driver:Main (System.String[] args)

I appears that the GConf schemas are not being installed by the ebuild (I'm not familiar with gconf...). I found a solution (http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=856518&postcount=6) that worked for me, just run:

$ gconftool-2 --install-schema-file /etc/gconf/schemas/last-exit.schemas

Can someone update the ebuild?
