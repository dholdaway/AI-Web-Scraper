Description

I know that the only official beta release of Chromium for Linux is the 4.0.249.43 version, but are there any plans to continue pushing weekly snapshots of the upstream development tree? Basically, I'm looking for a middle ground between using the -9999 ebuild (which requires downloading the entire source tree every time, which would take hours alone) and using the beta; effectively, something equivalent to Chromium's so-called "dev channel."

Well, you can expect dev channel releases roughly once a week, and the plan is to bump the ebuild for each dev channel release. You can follow all the upstream releases on http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/

The snapshots are not equivalent to the dev channel, because they don't go through QA. It's basically a random thing from trunk that happened to pass a subset of automated tests (which is still valuable).

I am aware that Chromium progresses quickly and people want to stay on the bleeding edge. That's good, and thanks for your interest! However, weekly or bi-weekly releases are still considered frequent, and packaging code not released upstream is not a standard practice (although it has been done a few times for the chromium package and might be done in the future). Please do not file bugs when that doesn't happen. IMHO the energy and time required to create source tarballs for the snapshots and test them is better spent on fixing Gentoo-specific bugs and using more system libraries instead of bundled ones.

By the way, if you really want the bleeding-edge-nightly-zomg-the-last-minute Chromium, please just consider chromium-bin-9999. :)

That link is useful; I hadn't realized that the Dev Channel hasn't actually updated since 4.0.266.0. I guess if the rest of the Dev Channel is waiting, so can I.
