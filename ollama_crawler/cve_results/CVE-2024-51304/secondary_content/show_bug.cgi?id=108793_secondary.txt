Hello,

Please test and then re-enable support for librsvg:

        DEPEND.bad: ~mips (default-linux/mips/2004.2)
>=net-libs/gecko-sdk-1.7.3
                net-libs/gecko-sdk-1.7.8 (missing keyword)
                net-libs/gecko-sdk-1.7.12 (missing keyword)
                net-libs/gecko-sdk-1.7.12-r1 (missing keyword)

gecko-sdk is gone, and gnome-base/librsvg-2.16.1 stable on mips. Obsolete bug.
