A reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the appendix to Truist’s Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Presentation.(2)Current quarter capital ratios are preliminary.(3)Comparisons noted in this section summarize changes from fourth quarter of 2023 compared to third quarter of 2023, unless otherwise noted.(4)These non-GAAP metrics do not adjust for merger-related and restructuring charges for 2023 periods.•Net loss was $5.2 billion, or $3.85 per diluted share, and includes:◦Non-cash goodwill impairment of $6.1 billion, or $4.53 per share, which has no impact on our liquidity, regulatory capital ratios, or our ability to pay our common dividend and service our clients’ financial needs◦FDIC special assessment of $507 million ($387 million after-tax), or $0.29 per share◦Discrete tax benefit of $204 million, or $0.15 per share◦Charges of $183 million ($139 million after-tax), or $0.10 per share, primarily due to restructuring activities related to our cost savings program•Adjusted PPNR(1) was $2.4 billion, up 8.6%◦Total revenues were up 0.5%▪Net interest income declined 0.6% due to lower earning assets and higher funding costs; Net interest margin improved three basis points▪Noninterest income was up 2.2% due to higher service charges on deposit and lending related fees, partially offset by lower other income◦Noninterest expense was up $6.5 billion due to the aforementioned items. Adjusted noninterest expense(1) was down $160 million, or 4.5%, reflecting our ongoing transformation into a more efficient organization, primarily due to lower personnel expense•Average loans and leases HFI decreased 1.7% due to declines in the commercial and industrial portfolio and indirect auto portfolio•Average deposits decreased 1.4% due to declines in non-interest bearing and money market and savings deposits•Asset quality remains solid◦Nonperforming assets declined 6.0%◦ALLL ratio increased five basis points◦Net charge-off ratio of 57 basis points, up six basis points primarily reflecting seasonality in the consumer portfolios•Capital and liquidity levels strengthened◦CET1 ratio(2) was 10.1%, up 20 basis points◦Consolidated LCR was 112%CEO Commentary“While reported results included several discrete items, we earned $1.1 billion on an adjusted basis during the fourth quarter, which excludes a non-cash goodwill impairment charge that has no impact on our regulatory capital ratios, liquidity, our ability to pay the common dividend, or service our clients.Underlying results were positive as our transformation into a simpler, more efficient, and profitable company is well underway. This transformative work was evident in our fourth quarter results given the sequential decline in adjusted expense and improvement in revenue.We continue to invest in our core franchise and risk management infrastructure and strengthen our balance sheet as we achieved a CET1 ratio of 10.1% at year-end. Asset quality continues to normalize but remains in-line relative to our outlook and allowance coverage ratios.Looking into 2024, we remain diligently focused on winning on our home court in the best U.S. markets by helping new and existing core clients reach their financial goals. Our heightened focus on capitalizing on this competitive advantage will drive efficiencies and growth that will lead to increased franchise and shareholder value.”— Bill Rogers, Truist Chairman & CEO`Contact: Investors:Brad Milsaps770.352.5347 | investors@truist.comMedia:Hannah Longmore402.613.3499 | media@truist.comThe following information was filed by Truist Financial Corp (TFC) on Thursday, January 18, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.
