(NYSE: HBI), a global leader in iconic apparel brands, today announced results for fourth-quarter and full-year 2023.“Our fourth quarter performance did not meet our expectations as the sales environment proved to be more challenging than expected.  However, we saw several positive indicators that give us confidence margins and leverage have reached a positive inflection point and demonstrate progress on our strategy to simplify our business, reduce inventory, cut costs, and reignite Innerwear,” said Steve Bratspies, CEO.  “Importantly, we exceeded our year-end goals in all four key 2023 performance metrics, including gross margin, inventory, operating cash flow and debt reduction.  During the quarter, new products and permanent retail space gains drove increased market share in U.S. Innerwear, which we expect to build upon as we rollout another record year of innovation and increase our brand marketing investments.  For 2024, we believe we’re well positioned for continued margin improvement, another year of strong cash generation and continued debt reduction.” 1The following information was filed by Hanesbrands Inc.

 Other - Other   Highlight
“Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or other SEC filings could cause noncompliance.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
The operating margin decline primarily resulted from approximately 380 basis points of unfavorable business mix from lower royalty income and unfavorable channel mix within Champion, approximately 445 basis points of commodity and ocean freight cost inflation and cost increases within our supply chain and approximately 140 basis points due to the deleverage of selling, general and administrative expenses as a result of the decline in sales volume and wage inflation partially offset by approximately 200 basis points from pricing actions taken in the second half of 2022.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Although we determined that no impairment existed for our goodwill as of the date the analysis was performed in the third quarter of 2023, these assets could be at risk for future impairment due to changes in our business or global economic conditions.
