enlightenment 2008-01-25 updated overlay

i know this isn't the best place but it's really late here... so... i upgraded a little part of the overlay.
The ebuilds use the http://download.enlightenment.org/snapshots/2008-01-25/ snapshot. I updated the src uri and the various dependencies; only the entrance ebuild needed some "work" because a typo in the tarball filename.
Just for your information all the e17 environment seems to work nicely.

I ran into this same problem.

Then I did as stated in comment #3: created ebuilds for the newest snapshot files (http://download.enlightenment.org/snapshots/2008-05-19/). 

The compilation ran just fine after that.
