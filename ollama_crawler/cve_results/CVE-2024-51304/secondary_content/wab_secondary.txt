 Inside Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Revenue - Product   Highlight
The decrease as a percentage of sales is primarily due to improved productivity and lower restructuring costs, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and the increase in the costs described above.



 Revenue - Product   Highlight
The Company recognizes a portion of its revenues on long-term customer agreements involving the design and production of highly engineered products that require revenue to be recognized over time because these products have no alternative use without significant economic loss and the agreements contain an enforceable right to payment including a reasonable profit margin from the customer in the event of contract termination.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
The significant assumptions used to estimate the value of the intangible assets and below-market customer contract liabilities include revenue growth rates, projected profit margins, discount rates, royalty rates, customer attrition rates, revenue obsolescence rates and market participant profit margins.

 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
The decrease is primarily attributable to lower foreign exchange gains and lower equity income in the current year compared to the prior year.
