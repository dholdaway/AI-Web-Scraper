I wonder if eiskaltdcpp could be split up in four versions for user that not want dependices of qt.When they use gnome like example.

In Arch linux AUR i find people have split it up to.

https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?O=0&K=eiskaltdcpp&do_Search=Go

eiskaltdcpp-gtk 2.2.7-1
eiskaltdcpp-gtk3 2.2.7-1
eiskaltdcpp-qt 2.2.7-1
eiskaltdcpp-cli-2.2.x-git 20120121-1


would be very nice to have it like that

Thanks
freddie

Er, this is Gentoo Linux. We have USE flags for that very purpose. Your candidates are:

 gnome gtk qt4 (or none of the former)

If this is /not/ what you intended to file this bug report for, then please explain your plans in more detail and reopen this bug report.
