 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could in the future have a material effect on our financial results.



 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
•Growth Markets operating income decreased as revenue growth in local currency and lower labor costs were more than offset by lower contract profitability and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates which resulted in a decline in U.S. dollar revenues.

Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates.

 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
From time to time, our geographic markets work together to sell and implement certain contracts.
