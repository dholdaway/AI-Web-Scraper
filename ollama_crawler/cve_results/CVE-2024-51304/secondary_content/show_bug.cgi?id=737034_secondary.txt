    app-text/mupdf: security bump to 1.17.0
    
    * Debundle dev-lang/mujs again for the
      security bug (bundled copy is probably OK
      in terms of release mujs, but not a new bug
      (CVE-2020-24343).
    
    * Document bundled libs with references
      to check when bumping. Useful for both
      security@ and the maintainer.
    
    * Include extra Debian patches for improved
      cross-compilation support (mostly pkg-config).
    
    * Fix existing patch to respect libdir in pkgconfig
      file.
    
    * Fix missing || dies.

This ended up being a non-issue but something to keep in mind.
