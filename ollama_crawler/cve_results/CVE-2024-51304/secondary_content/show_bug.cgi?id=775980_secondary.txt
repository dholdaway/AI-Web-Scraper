Strange. It looks like x11-misc/util-macros is missing from your system. Can you confirm that it's not installed?

But it's automatically added to BDEPEND by xorg-3.eclass when XORG_EAUTORECONF=yes is set, which it is...

Libtool was also broken so I started 'emerge -e world' to see if something will improve. Well it works now, I don't know what exactly was broken but it has not been catched by our tools.
