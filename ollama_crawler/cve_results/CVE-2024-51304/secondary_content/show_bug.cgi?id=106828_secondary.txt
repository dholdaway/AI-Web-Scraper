Description


Hermann Chong

Some applications take a while to start up for the first time, taking time to 
access the hard drive before displaying anything on the screen.  An example of 
this is the Firefox browser.  When I double-click on a desktop icon to start 
Firefox, or use Metacity to start it up with a key binding, the only 
indication that I have successfully started the program is the blinking of my 
hard drive light.

I believe that there should be some sort of indication that the program has 
been successfully started, so I don't end up opening one firefox window and 
five "Select a profile" windows.  In Windows, the solution is to put an 
hourglass next to the mouse, which helps immensely.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find a program that takes a while to load before showing up on the screen.
2. Run it.
3. Look for any indication on the screen that you've successfully run the 
program.

Actual Results:  
The system doesn't show any indication that a new program is loading.

Expected Results:  
Some gnome programs add a temporary task to the task bar, but for those that 
don't use the task bar applet, it might be better just to use the mouse 
indicator to show that a program is running.

put StartupNotify=true in the .desktop files that you want this to happen with.
( you need startup-notification )
