(NYSE: LEVI) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended November 26, 2023."I am proud of what we have accomplished over the past twelve years. By putting the Levi’s brand at the center of culture, we revitalized this iconic brand and transformed our financials putting us in a position where we are stronger today,” said Chip Bergh, president and chief executive officer of Levi Strauss & Co.  “While 2023 was a challenging year, we ended on a strong note and I am optimistic about the future. I couldn't be more confident in Michelle as my successor, and together with the rest of our team, they position the company to thrive in its next phase of growth.”"I am honored to take the role of chief executive officer of this iconic company and thank Chip for his exceptional leadership in having built a solid foundation for future growth,” said Michelle Gass, president and incoming chief executive officer of Levi Strauss & Co.  “We have a strong pipeline of newness and innovation launching this year to fuel consumer demand. And I am confident in the significant growth opportunities ahead for this company- including accelerating international growth, becoming a denim apparel lifestyle business, and leading with DTC. The success of these strategic initiatives drove our growth in the fourth quarter and position us to create outsized long-term shareholder value in the years ahead.” Global Productivity InitiativeIn the first quarter of 2024, the company’s Board of Directors endorsed a multi-year global productivity initiative, Project FUEL, designed to accelerate the execution of our Brand Led and DTC First strategies while fueling long-term profitable growth.  This is expected to be a two-year initiative with a focus on optimizing the operating model and structure, redesigning business processes and identifying opportunities to reduce costs while simplifying processes across the organization. In fiscal 2024, it is expected this initiative will generate net cost savings of $100 million. The first phase of the global productivity initiative is expected to occur in the first half of 2024 and is expected to include a 10% to 15% reduction of our global corporate workforce. As a result, the Company expects to record estimated restructuring charges of $110 to $120 million in the first quarter. Additional restructuring charges may be incurred as the company progresses further with this initiative.“We achieved a strong Q4 performance, inflecting to growth along with substantial margin expansion, generation of positive free cash flow and closing the year with record net store openings,” said Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer.  “Looking forward, we are focused on margin execution supported by gross margin expansion and by our global productivity initiative, which gives us clear line of sight to significant annual cost savings.”The following information was filed by Levi Strauss Co (LEVI) on Thursday, January 25, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.
