 Inside Fair Isaac Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Income   Highlight
Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results.



 M & A - Other   Highlight
The revolving line of credit and term loan contain certain restrictive covenants including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.5 to 1.0, subject to a step up to 4.0 to 1.0 following certain permitted acquisitions and subject to certain conditions, and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
In addition, as COVID-19 related restrictions have been relaxed, we held more corporate events, increased advertising and promotional expenses and increased travel costs.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
The increase in personnel and labor costs was primarily attributable to increases in employee time allocated to cost of revenues, increased stock-based compensation expense, increased incentive expense and increased headcount.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period, we record a corresponding income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.
