Doesn't emerge. Seems there are declarative inconsistencies with OCaml's PCRE support.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Just try to emerge.
Actual Results:  
The files /usr/lib64/ocaml/site-packages/netstring/netstring_str.cmi
and /usr/lib64/ocaml/site-packages/pcre/pcre.cmi
make inconsistent assumptions over interface Pcre

I finally managed to fix the problem by re-emerging

$ emerge -v1 dev-ml/pcre-ocaml dev-ml/ocamlnet

After that, the problem no longer occurred.

Thus it seems the problem is part of Portage's imperfect dependency resolution which sometimes misses packages which need to be rebuilt.

Anyway, this is a generic problem of Portage and hence not specific to this package.
