When I minimize the vncviewer window from the titlebar button (KDE), the
application crashes with:

CleanupXErrorHandler called
X Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
  Major opcode of failed request:  42 (X_SetInputFocus)
  Serial number of failed request:  13365
  Current serial number in output stream:  13365

When I minimize by clicking the window's item in the taskbar, everything's fine.

This may be related to using the "-via" switch to tunnel a VNC connection over
SSH.  I can't easily test a direct connection, so I don't know.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use tightvnc's vncviewer to connect to a VNC server on KDE (using "-via" to
connect over SSH may be necessary).
2. Click the titlebar's (KDE) minimize button.
3. Observe the crash.
Actual Results:  
VNC window disappeared, error message displayed.

Expected Results:  
Minimized to the taskbar.

please test with 1.2.9-r1 or 1.3_alpha7 after a emerge sync, both version should have sufficient fixes for amd64, if i get no response within 48 hours i consider this WORKSFORME

good luck
