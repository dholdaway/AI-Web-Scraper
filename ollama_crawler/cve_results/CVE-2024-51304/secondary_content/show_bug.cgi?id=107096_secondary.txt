-------- Original Message -------- 
Subject: [ardour-dev] ardour 0.99 released 
Date: Fri, 23 Sep 2005 23:07:26 -0400 
From: Paul Davis <paul@linuxaudiosystems.com> 
To: ardour-dev@lists.ardour.org 
 
 
       http://ardour.org/releases/ardour-0.99.tar.bz2 
 
  (see subsequent message for info about the post-0.99 development pathway) 
 
 
Changes since 0.9beta30 
----------------------- 
  
   * When plugins are silenced, feed them the amount of silenced buffers 
     as the plugin has inputs instead of only one buffer. (fixes 
     "explosions" with various reverb plugins) 
      
   * fix for i18n problems (incorrect definition of _() macro for 
     gtk_ardour directory). Translators should now be able to 
     see the results of their efforts now. 
 
   * change DEBIAN -> SYSLIBS  
    
   * do not build KSI by default 
 
   * add check for installed xgettext tool if NLS=1 
    
   * the "real" new ardour_ui.rc 
 
   * "fixes" for Connections editor to reflect whether editing input 
     or output connection. the entire dialog is a disaster, but ... 
 
   * add error message if trying to export a range when none is 
     defined 
 
   * Stephane Letz's patch for OS X Tiger altivec optimization, slightly 
     reworked (thank you!) 
 
   * recent session fix from nick_m 
 
   * New fader graphic & alignment correction for the rail the 
     fader moves on (thanks Reuben!) 
 
   * patch to support use of environment variables CC, CXX 
       and DIST_CC_HOSTS, thus allowing compiling with distcc 
       as well as ccache (thanks Tim!) 
 
   * reversed zoom bindings, to follow GIMP and others

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  See email from Paul Davis, ardour lead developer (copied in details)   
2.  Can rename ardour_0.9_beta30.ebuild to ardour_0.99.ebuild  
3.  emerge ardour 
   
Actual Results:  
Version 0.99 emerges successfully 

Expected Results:  
ardour-0.99 is last in pre-1.0 series, no longer marked as beta. This version 
should be made available to gentoo users.

released with some pretty bad scons bugs, some fixes should be upstream very soon, going to wait to 
bump it for a few days.

The ardour-0.99 ebuild in portage doesn't compile for me. I get these sandbox

Ardour 0.99 builds on AMD64 for me, however, the dependency for libsndfile is
out of date. The ardour ebuild lists 1.0.4 as the dependency but it would not
build for me with 1.0.11, I had to upgrade libsndfile to 1.0.12.

The ebuild dependency should be modified to say ">=media-libs/libsndfile-1.0.12"

ardour 0.99 was built just fine with libsndfile 1.0.11 - Can you show me the
errors you've got in the build?

for the scons issues - I've seen other package with this kind of behaviour
solved by reemerging scons. It built without a problem for me.

lzap - the manifest issue was fixed.

Just to confirm, rebuilding scons did fix the issue in Comment #2.

Emilie, ardour 0.99 was built just fine with libsndfile 1.0.11 - Can you post
the errors you've got?

Emilie, reopen the bug with the error log when you get around to it.
