Description

I was using 2.6.11-gentoo-r6 until today when I rebooted my system.  Upon startup in X, my window manager was totally messed up.  As soon as I moved the mouse, the cursor switch to the busy watch icon.  Then, it appeared not to send any window messages to any clients.  I could start new X windows clients from another virtual terminal and control them via the keyboard, but the mouse was completely unresponsive.  As a lark, I tried my wife's setup (KDE) and it worked perfectly.  After more investigation, I was able to determine that fvwm would work fine if I used an old configuration, but as soon as I switched to the highly configured fvwm-crystal setup, the problems reoccured.

Since I had also upgraded to udev-50 yesterday, I wanted to make sure that it wasn't the culprit.  I rebooted back into 2.6.11-gentoo-r6 and was able to run fvwm-crystal again without any problems at all.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge fvwm-crystal gentoo-sources
2. cd /usr/src/linux-2.6.11-gentoo-r8
3. make
4. cp /usr/src/linux-2.6.11-gentoo-r8/arch/i386/boot/bzImage /boot/bzImage-2.6.11-gentoo-r8
5. edit /boot/grub/grub.conf to point to new kernel
6. reboot into 2.6.11-gentoo-r8
7. login
8. edit .xinitrc to start fvwm-crystal
9. startx

Actual Results:  
Unusable system as described above

Expected Results:  
Normal X behavior

Does it work with gentoo-sources-2.6.12?

I assume no answer means the problem was fixed. If not, feel free to reopen.
