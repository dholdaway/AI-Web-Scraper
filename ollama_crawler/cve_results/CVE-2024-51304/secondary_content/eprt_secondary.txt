 Inside Essential Properties Realty Trust, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Shares   Highlight
However, at any point in time, there may be a number of factors that could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to access these capital sources, including unfavorable conditions in the overall equity and credit markets, our level of leverage, the portion of our portfolio that is unencumbered, our credit ratings, borrowing restrictions imposed by our existing debt agreements, general market conditions for real estate and potentially REITs specifically, our operating performance, our liquidity and general market perceptions about us.



 Other - Other   Highlight
Changes in our allowance for credit losses are presented within change in provision for credit losses in the accompanying statements of operations.

 Other - Other   Highlight
The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that are subjective in nature and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially from our estimates.

 Financial - Debt   Highlight
In addition to the financial covenants described above, the Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things and subject to exceptions, limit or restrict our ability to incur indebtedness and liens, consummate mergers or other fundamental changes, dispose of assets, make certain restricted payments, make certain investments, modify our organizational documents, transact with affiliates, change our fiscal periods, provide negative pledge clauses, make subsidiary distributions, enter into certain new lines of business or engage in certain activities, and fail to meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT.

 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
Under ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, we use a real estate loss estimate model (“RELEM”) which estimates losses on our loans and direct financing lease receivable portfolio, for purposes of calculating allowances for credit losses.
