I upgraded from -r4 to -r5, did the emerge @module-rebuild (which shouldn't have any effect on the touchpad), and the touchpad isn't working anymore.

please active "# CONFIG_INPUT_TOUCHSCREEN is not set" in your kernel and try also the new gentoo-sources-2.6.30-r6 kernel

I don't want to have touchscreen support but touchpad support.
Is this shifted to CONFIG_INPUT_TOUCHSCREEN?

Could we have a copy of your dmesg?
As far as CONFIG_INPUT_TOUCHSCREEN is concerned, I don't think it has to do anything with your touchpad.

          2009-08-31 06:42:30 UTC
        

So it magicaly got fixed, but...
Mean while I upgraded following packages

sys-apps/hal-0.5.11-r9 -> sys-apps/hal-0.5.13-r2
sys-fs/udev-141 -> sys-fs/udev-145

if it reappears I will reopen the bug.
