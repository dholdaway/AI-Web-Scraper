i was trying to fix/update the update-downloads script to handle more images, but it seems access is restricted.  i thought devs were supposed to be able to fix issues here ?

$ git push

FATAL -- ACCESS DENIED
Repo            sites/www                                                   
User            vapier@gentoo.org                                           
Stage           Before git was called                                       
Operation       Repo write                                                  

FATAL: W any sites/www vapier@gentoo.org DENIED by fallthru

Website was always and is maintained docs/infra/website team.
The old /proj/ was free for all devs; that's on the wiki now though.

Given the near-zero interest in any contributions to the site, there's no set procedure right now; so patches to www@ or a forked repo please, I'll merge them for you.

As for every dev not having access, that's intended, so I'll close the bug.
