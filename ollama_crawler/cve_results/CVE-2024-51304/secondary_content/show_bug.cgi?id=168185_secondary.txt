Description

Mplayer has problems playing many (I would say more than fifty percent but less than seventy-five percent, but that most likely does not represent a random sample) of the .flv files found on a large video sharing site.

The video simply runs faster than the audio (about ten percent), so the clip gets more and more out of sync during playback.

Vlc will play the files correctly.

Some output (for the URL above):

Use -mc 10 or, if your version is recent enough, -correct-pts.

Both of those work (the second one actually works a bit better).

Maybe I should have seen the first option (the man page doesn't even mention the second one at all), although it seems to me that a media player should (by default) keep the audio and video in sync.

Thanks
