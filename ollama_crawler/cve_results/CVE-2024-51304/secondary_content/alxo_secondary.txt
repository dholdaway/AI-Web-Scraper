ALX Oncology Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results and Provides Corporate Update
 
 
SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., March 7, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ALX Oncology Holdings Inc., (“ALX Oncology” or “the Company”) (Nasdaq: ALXO), an immuno-oncology company developing therapies that block the CD47 immune checkpoint pathway, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023, and provided a corporate update. 
 
“This past year proved to be a profound growth period for ALX Oncology highlighted by evorpacept’s positive results in the prespecified randomized interim analysis of the ASPEN-06 Phase 2 clinical trial in advanced HER2-positive gastric/GEJ cancer,” said Jason Lettmann, Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of ALX Oncology. “Notably, this outcome is particularly important as it represents the first promising activity in a randomized trial in solid tumors in the CD47 space and further underscores evorpacept’s differentiation. Over the next 12-18 months, we expect to report multiple value inflection datapoints, with the goal of advancing evorpacept’s potential beyond anti-cancer antibodies through ongoing combination studies with ADCs and checkpoint inhibitors. With nine ongoing trials, our goal is to expand evorpacept’s value to other tumor types including breast, NHL, multiple myeloma and urothelial cancers as well as accelerate our efforts to identify new indications around this highly differentiated asset.”
Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights
•Appointed long-standing board member, Jason Lettmann to CEO, while co-founder and previous CEO, Jaume Pons, Ph.D., transitioned to Chief Scientific Officer in September. 
•Reported positive results from a prespecified interim analysis of the Phase 2 randomized multi-center international clinical trial of ASPEN-06 for the treatment of advanced HER2-positive gastric/gastroesophageal junction (“GEJ”) cancer in October.
oKey findings from the 54 randomized subjects, which included those previously treated with ENHERTU® (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki) and/or immune checkpoint inhibitors, reported a confirmed overall response rate (“ORR”) of 52 percent in the evorpacept combination treatment arm compared to 22 percent for the control group of trastuzumab + CYRAMZA® (ramucirumab) + paclitaxel (“TRP”). 
oMedian duration of response (“mDOR”) was not reached for the evorpacept TRP combination treatment arm compared to 7.4 months for the control group of TRP. 
oThe safety profile of evorpacept was consistent with the Company’s previous clinical trials and remained well-tolerated in this reported treatment combination. 
oThe interim results compared favorably to the efficacy results reported for CYRAMZA + paclitaxel in the RAINBOW study (ORR of 28 percent and mDOR of 4.4 months), which currently serves as the regulatory benchmark and global standard-of-care for second-line gastric/GEJ cancer.
•Executed an oversubscribed underwritten public offering that generated gross proceeds of approximately $63.2 million during October, which helps to extend the Company’s expected cash runway into early 2026. The follow-on offering closely followed the report of the positive
