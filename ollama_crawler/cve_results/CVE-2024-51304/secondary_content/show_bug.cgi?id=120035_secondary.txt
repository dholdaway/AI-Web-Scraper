After emerging the new version of syslog-ng it would be nice to know which daemons will stop when restarting syslog:

# /etc/init.d/syslog-ng depend 
/etc/init.d/syslog-ng: line 12: need: command not found
/etc/init.d/syslog-ng: line 15: need: command not found
/etc/init.d/syslog-ng: line 16: provide: command not found
marge ~ #

So look at depend() in the init script. Also, this is not syslog-ng specific at all.

Thanks Jakub, that's exactly what I did, but why in this case is the depend function present in the opts variable if we can't execute a syslog-ng depend ?
