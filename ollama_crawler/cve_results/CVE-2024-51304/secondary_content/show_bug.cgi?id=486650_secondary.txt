I think inaccurate dependence. When this error occurs when updating the world, me helped these steps:

emerge -DNu --skip-first world
emerge -DNu world

I assume this was the fix

older jadetex had a bug that made it become broken when upgrading texlive; it is not a wrong dep but rather a bug in jadetex which was fixed in -r6

closing as worksforme
