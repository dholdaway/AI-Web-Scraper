Just a small correction. I use portage-2.0.54 so this may be fixed in later versions.

cloud games-engines # man 5 ebuild | grep use_with  
                     myconf="$(use_with jpeg libjpeg)"
                     myconf="$(use_with jpeg libjpeg)"
                     myconf="$(use_with opengl")

Note the last quote which should be after the paranthesis.

This is already fixed in portage 2.1
