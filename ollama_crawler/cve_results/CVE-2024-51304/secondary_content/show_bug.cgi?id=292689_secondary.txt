Some days ago, I upgraded xorg to 1.7.1 and updated the nvidia drivers too. Since then, many times within an hour, the mouse pointer jumps on the upper left corner of the screen... Everytime this happens, i check the Xorg.0.log an see the following messsage many times:

"Microsft Microsoft Wireless Desktop Receiver 3.1: dropping event due to full queue!"

Any idea....?

Reproducible: Always

It seems that problem is solved. I changed the mouse driver in xorg.conf from "mouse" to "evdev"... Now, everything is back to normal.
