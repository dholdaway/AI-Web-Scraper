Would be great to have something like /etc/portage/install-qa-check.d/ to process custom qa check. They can be tested by tinderboxers or AT's before put them for everyone.

I've noticed that we already permit adding custom checks via /usr/local/install-qa-check.d and ago confirmed on IRC it's going to work for him.
