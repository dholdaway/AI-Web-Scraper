According to the summary page, the netkit-rusers package should include rpc.rusersd, however after emerging it, no such file was present (it should be in /usr/sbin, but it wasn't anywhere in my path).  However, the other two programs included in this package (rusers and rup) were installed correctly.

/usr/bin/rusersd, according to the ebuild.
