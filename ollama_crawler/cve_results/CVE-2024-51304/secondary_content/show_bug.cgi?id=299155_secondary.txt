Description

From the info page of gpm: (overview section)

"As of release 1.20.0 the default device is removed. Now -m is a must."
"Release 1.20.1 introduces the must for -t and a specific way to use"

when I check the ebuilds on a current machine, I see nothing earlier than 1.20.5

http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gpm.xml assumes that /etc/conf.d/gpm is being used to configure for -m and -t.  For gpm to work ,the values for -m and -t seem to be needed on the command line. 

package: sys-libs/gpm-1.20.5

This is a minor problem, since I suspect that most people would be able to figure this out.

Reproducible: Always

Works for me without needing to change anything. Been this way for years, even with the latest version. The env variables in conf.d must somehow set this up automagically, since I've never needed to resort to commandline switches like -m and -t.
