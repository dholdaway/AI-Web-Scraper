In
https://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-dev/message/7c3d3d85efafaf4bed142e5a76628e2e
it says minetest_game was removed from portage tree because it is now part of games-action/minetest itself, but when running minetest it only gives me devtest and not the minetest game:
>>>
% minetest --gameid list                                                                                                                                                                                              devtest
<<<

Also I get an X Error when trying to run minetest:
>>>
X Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)
  Major opcode of failed request:  150 (GLX)
  Minor opcode of failed request:  34 ()
  Value in failed request:  0x0
  Serial number of failed request:  79
  Current serial number in output stream:  80
<<<

Ok seems my opengl was broken due to updates, a restart solved the X Error and then I was able to download the minetest_game via the client.
