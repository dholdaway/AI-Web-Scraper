Description

I tried to emerge inkscape using x86. The newest stable ebuild in x86 branch   
requires a glib ebuild > 2.7. Currently there are only ebuilds for 2.6 and  
2.8. Unfortunately all 2.8 ebuilds in portage are ~x86! This means users of 
stable x86 can't emerge inkscape right now (or have to manually merge a 2.8 
ebuild which is marked unstable, which I will do right now :))

I fail to understand...


john@linuxserver ~ $ sudo emerge -pve =media-gfx/inkscape-0.42.2 | grep glib
[ebuild  N    ] dev-libs/glib-2.6.5  +doc +hardened -static 0 kB 
[ebuild  N    ] sys-libs/glibc-2.3.5-r2  -build -erandom -glibc-compat20
-glibc-omitfp +hardened -linuxthreads-tls (-multilib) +nls -nptl -nptlonly -pic
-profile (-selinux) +userlocales 0 kB 
[ebuild  N    ] dev-cpp/glibmm-2.6.1  -debug +doc 0 kB 


The glib you're referring to is dev-libs/glib, correct?  Because there is no
reference to dev-libs/glib in the InkScape 0.42.2 ebuild:


john@linuxserver ~ $ grep "dev-libs/glib"
/usr/portage/media-gfx/inkscape/inkscape-0.42.2.ebuild | wc -l
0

glibmm is there. Looks like we should check better the inkscape deps and ask
arch mantainers to bump {glib,gtk}{,mm} accordingly.

Luca already said it but heres what I get merging 0.42.2: 
 
# emerge inkscape -vp 
 
These are the packages that I would merge, in order: 
 
Calculating dependencies | 
!!! All ebuilds that could satisfy ">=dev-libs/glib-2.7" have been masked. 
!!! One of the following masked packages is required to complete your request: 
- dev-libs/glib-2.8.3 (masked by: ~x86 keyword) 
- dev-libs/glib-2.8.2 (masked by: ~x86 keyword) 
 
For more information, see MASKED PACKAGES section in the emerge man page or 
section 2.2 "Software Availability" in the Gentoo Handbook. 
!!!    (dependency required by "dev-cpp/glibmm-2.8.1" [ebuild])

emerge -vp glibmm gtkmm
emerge info

there is something wrong and isn't in our portage tree (checked right now)

Ok, I was partly wrong. I had glibmm and gtkmm marked for ~x86  
in /etc/portage/package.keywords. If I remove them, I can merge inkscape, so  
sorry for this. Seems like I didn't remember that I moved my  
portage.keywords from my old laptop. Really sorry for this one.
