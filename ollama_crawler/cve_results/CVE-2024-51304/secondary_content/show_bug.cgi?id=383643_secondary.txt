media-libs/liblrdf-0.4.0-r20 install /usr/include/lrdf.h
In that file, we found:

# cat /usr/include/lrdf.h|grep raptor
include <raptor.h>

but raptor.h is not in /usr/include:
# equery f raptor|grep raptor.h
/usr/include/raptor2/raptor.h
and
# equery f raptor|grep raptor2.h
/usr/include/raptor2/raptor2.h

More:
# cat /usr/include/raptor2/raptor.h
#include <raptor2.h>

From that, I can find 2 errors:
/usr/include/raptor2/raptor.h and /usr/include/lrdf.h must include
#include <raptor2/raptor2.h>

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge -1 raptor liblrdf
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
The raptor2.h includes in /usr/include/raptor2/raptor.h and /usr/include/lrdf.h point to /usr/include/raptor2.h

Expected Results:  
They should point to /usr/include/raptor2/raptor2.h

Should be #include <raptor2.h> then, the path is coming from the pkg-config file as -I flag.

pkg-config --cflags lrdf

Reverse dependencies need to use pkg-config to use liblrdf-0.4.0-r20 (or upstream git which will be tagged as 0.5.0 soon). It's the correct thing to do.

I've reported this upstream:

https://github.com/swh/LRDF/issues/4

And you might also be intrested in:

https://github.com/swh/LRDF/pull/2

0.5.0 is about to get tagged, hopefully the Issue 4 will be in it, and we get a clean version out.

See upstream comment in the linked bug.  

I don't think we have to do anything here, long as raptor.h is installed, therefore closing this as WORKSFORME until such time that raptor.h is removed by raptor upstream.
