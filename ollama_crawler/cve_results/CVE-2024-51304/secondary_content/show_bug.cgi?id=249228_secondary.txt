I use bogofilter myself with Claws and upgraded flawlessly from 3.5.0 some time ago.  What's the content of /usr/lib/claws-mail/plugins/?  Please try to unload/reload your bogofilter plugin.

If this does not help, please start claws-mail with --debug from a command line and copy the parts around the bogofilter message (or better the complete log, check for confidential information like passwords).

 For me the problem has been worked around. I downloaded the 3.6.1 source tarball from Sourceforge and installed it myself. Initially it still didn't work, but then when I uninstalled the bogofilter plugin and reinstalled it, it worked perfectly.

I had already tried uninstalling and reinstalling the bogofilter plugin with the Gentoo ebuild for 3.6.1 but the problem remained.

I would conclude that the problem likely has something to do with the building or linking of the bogofilter plugin in the Gentoo ebuild. But if it works for you and there are no other complaints, it must be local to me and I will forget it, because I don't have time to uninstall the tarball and reinstall the ebuild at this time, just to debug the problem.

For the record, the current file list in directory /usr/lib/claws-mail/plugins/:
shur@univers ~ $ ls /usr/lib/claws-mail/plugins/
bogofilter.a        gtkhtml2_viewer.so  pgpmime.a     spamassassin.a
bogofilter.la       pgpcore.a           pgpmime.deps  spamassassin.la
bogofilter.so       pgpcore.la          pgpmime.la    spamassassin.so
