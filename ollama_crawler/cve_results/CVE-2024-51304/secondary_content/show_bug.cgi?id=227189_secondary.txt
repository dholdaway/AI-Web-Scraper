When looking at gnome-2.22.1 ebuild I notice that :
RDEPEND="...
    >=x11-libs/gtksourceview-1.8.5:1.0
    >=x11-libs/gtksourceview-2.2.1:2.0
..."
is it normal ?

Reproducible: Always

Yes. See http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/teams/releng/2.22.1/versions
Everything didn't upgrade to gtksourceview-2 in 2.22 yet, I believe. So we make sure that for those at least the suggested version (1.8.5) is used at a minimum from that slot.
