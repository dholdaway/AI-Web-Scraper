Firefox crashes when displaying the SVG file in $URL, however another SVG file doesn't crash, besides using other distros it doesn't crash.

It doesn't matter wether we use -bin or not -bin, the error is as follows:
The application 'firefox-bin' lost its connection to the display :1.0;
most likely the X server was shut down or you killed/destroyed
the application.
firefox-bin exited with non-zero status (1)

Maybe related to xorg-server? And btw, it doesn't matter what version of firefox, tried with 2 and 3, so not a regression

Can you post some more information, emerge --info, flags used to build firefox as it perfectly works for me with firefox 3.0.1?

I think its a xorg bug

I'm using ~amd64 globally. Have you tried any other browsers?

I upgraded to ~arch and the problem went away, interesting, uh?

And FYI, i'm just forwarding from https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=440522

Definitely a xorg-server bug or anything related(cairo+xorg-server-1.3?)

Now that we have 1.5 stable, closing. If the problem still persists, please don't hesitate to reopen.
