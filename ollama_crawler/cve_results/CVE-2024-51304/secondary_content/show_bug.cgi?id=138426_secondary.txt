Description

I tried to stop and restart /etc/init.d/fancontrol and I couldn't because the daemon had already died and the init script couldn't accept this.

Here is what happened when I tried to restart the daemon:

zebedee linux # /etc/init.d/fancontrol restart
 * Stopping fancontrol ...
start-stop-daemon: warning: failed to kill 6716: No such process
1 pids were not killed
No process in pidfile `/var/run/fancontrol.pid' found running; none kill  [ !! ]

And when I deleted the pid file, this happened:

zebedee linux # /etc/init.d/fancontrol status
 * status:  started
zebedee linux # /etc/init.d/fancontrol start
 * WARNING:  "fancontrol" has already been started.
zebedee linux # /etc/init.d/fancontrol stop
 * Stopping fancontrol ...
No process in pidfile `/var/run/fancontrol.pid' found running; none kill  [ !! ]

I was only able to restart the daemon by first starting an instance of fancontrol from an xterm, writing that process's pid to the /var/run/fancontrol.pid, and, after that, finally  doing "/etc/init.d/fancontrol stop" and "/etc/init.d/fancontrol start"
