I have recently upgraded from GCC 3.4.6 to GCC 4.1.2. I managed to complete emerge -e system as per the upgrade instructions, but compilation fails during emerge -e world where x11-libs/libsynaptics-0.14.6b fails:
 i686-pc-linux-gnu-g++ -DPACKAGE_NAME=\"\" -DPACKAGE_TARNAME=\"\" -DPACKAGE_VERSION=\"\" -DPACKAGE_STRING=\"\" -DPACKAGE_BUGREPORT=\"\" -DPACKAGE=\"libsynaptics\" -DVERSION=\"0.14.4d\" -DSTDC_HEADERS=1 -DHAVE_SYS_TYPES_H=1 -DHAVE_SYS_STAT_H=1 -DHAVE_STDLIB_H=1 -DHAVE_STRING_H=1 -DHAVE_MEMORY_H=1 -DHAVE_STRINGS_H=1 -DHAVE_INTTYPES_H=1 -DHAVE_STDINT_H=1 -DHAVE_UNISTD_H=1 -DHAVE_DLFCN_H=1 -I. -I. -O2 -march=pentium-m -pipe -MT pad.lo -MD -MP -MF .deps/pad.Tpo -c pad.cpp  -fPIC -DPIC -o .libs/pad.o

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

Actual Results:  
output pasted in summary

Expected Results:  
Compilation continues without error

 What CFLAGS do you use? It builds fine here with 
'-02 -pipe -march=pentium-m -mtune=pentium-m'

I compiled with the flags linked on the forum page and the ones suggested above and it still fails.

version 0.14.4c is bumped. 
please let me know if you still can't emerge w/ this version.

My hard drive crashed since this problem so I will be reinstalling from scratch at a later date. All my gcc 3.4.6->4.1.2 problems (including this one) are moot. Thank you for investigating though.

Not sure how to classify this bug now?

as WORKS4ME, until you run into the veeery same issue once again, so just reopen if you rerun into the same problem ;)
