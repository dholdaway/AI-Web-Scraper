x11-misc/gigolo has been part of the Xfce Goodies project. so "xfce-extra" is more suitable category, isn't it?

if there are some reasons for in "x11-misc", feel free to mark INVALID this bug.

thanks,


Reproducible: Always

and this is a quiet trivial thing. "index.html" can be dropped from HOMEPAGE.

1. Thunar can handle most of these things now on it's own from the "Go -> Open Location ..." menu entry

2. gigolo doesn't have any Xfce dependencies, it's plain GTK+ application

So no, we are not going to move it

I've dropped the index.html reference from the HOMEPAGE but please refrain from asking minor things like these in future, it's really just bikeshedding and adds unnecessary work to already lacking manpower.

Thanks, Samuli

Samuli,

thank you for explanation.

and sorry to bother you (and all comitter, too). I'll consider whether bugs I filed are really worthwhile. thank for pointing out.
