Description

Gutenprint, formerly named Gimp-Print, is a suite of printer drivers that may be used with most common UNIX and Linux print spooling systems, including CUPS, lpr, LPRng, or others. These drivers provide high quality printing for UNIX (including Macintosh OS X 10.2, 10.3, and 10.4) and Linux systems that in many cases equal or exceed proprietary vendor-supplied drivers in quality and functionality, and can be used for demanding printing tasks requiring flexibility and high quality. This software package includes an enhanced Print plugin for the GIMP that replaces the plugin packaged with the GIMP, and Ghostscript and CUPS drivers, as well as Foomatic data supporting the Ghostscript driver.

Gutenprint has been renamed in order to clearly distinguish it from the GIMP. While this package started out as the original Print plugin for the GIMP, it has expanded into a collection of general purpose printer drivers, and the new, enhanced Print plugin for the GIMP is now only a small part of the package. Furthermore, the name Gutenprint recognizes Johannes Gutenberg, the inventor of the movable type printing press. Finally, the word guten is the German word for good.

Gutenprint 5.0 incorporates extensive feedback from the beta and release candidate programs. It has been completely revised since the very popular Gimp-Print 4.2 series, and you should read this manual carefully.

Gutenprint supports only the printer part of multi-function devices (devices that typically include scanning, copying, and fax capabilities).

We recommend that all users who wish to use this package for general purpose printing use either CUPS or, if they use another printing system or no spooler at all, use Foomatic with the Ghostscript driver (both described below), rather than integrating the Ghostscript driver with self-made scripts or even manually typing in Ghostscript command lines. It is much simpler to manage with CUPS or Foomatic and its PPDs. CUPS provides an excellent web-based interface for easy printer administration, and all CUPS-enabled applications (OpenOffice.org, all KDE apps, etc.) and printing dialogs (kprinter, xpp, etc.) show all the options in easy to use GUIs. Please visit http://www.cups.org/ for information on downloading and installing CUPS.

Gutenprint currently supports over 700 printer models.

Gutenprint was formerly called Gimp-Print. Gimp-Print 4.2.7 (the last Gimp-Print 4.2 release) is still available for distribution. You may install both Gimp-Print 4.2.7 and Gutenprint 5.0 concurrently and choose which to use.

thx need to be rename =]

Not slotted in Gentoo, so no, you can't install 4.2.7 and 5.0 at the same time...
