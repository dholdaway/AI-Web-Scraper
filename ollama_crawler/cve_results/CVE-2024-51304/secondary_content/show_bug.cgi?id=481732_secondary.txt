There is a checksum problem:


>>> Emerging (1 of 1) sci-electronics/systemc-2.3.0
Refetching... File renamed to '/usr/portage/distfiles/systemc-2.3.0.tgz._checksum_failure_.qLekFP'

I got the checksum problem too:

Refetching... File renamed to '/usr/portage/distfiles/systemc-2.3.0.tgz._checksum_failure_.06x672'

AND

Refetching... File renamed to '/usr/portage/distfiles/systemc-2.2.0.tgz._checksum_failure_.s7g865'

...any ideas?

Another problem, albeit gentoo isn't responsible for this, is that the package Accellera provides isn't valid. It is indeed a .tgz file, yet both portage and tar --gzip -xvf systemc-2.3.0.tgz return

gzip: stdin: not in gzip format
tar: Child returned status 1
tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now

hmmm... I'll try to bring Accellera in on this.

Any news on this?

Just as a follow up: 

Looking into bugzilla I found similar problems for the systemc-2.2.0, e.g. #206471, #296480 and so on. So I am not really sure what is going on here.


To check I just repeated the download of the original file  from http://www.accellera.org/downloads/standards/systemc.
After accepting the license I get the same file as one year ago: same sha, same size, no problems.

So sorry not reproducible here.

I tried contacting them a while ago via the "contact us" for the website help, but I never received a reply.

I just now tried to contact them a second time in the same way, so I'm going to wait for about week or two before before I try something else to give them another chance to respond.

Got an email back from someone at Accellera that says their technical support team is working on it.

Just downloaded it again and verified again that it is working correctly. If problem still exists try systemc-2.3.1.
