Description

I've got a headless machine with tigervnc installed.  The new version of tigervnc seems to require xsm in order to fire properly.  by stracing the vncsession binary, I was able to discover it was trying to launch xsm...and failing because it wasn't there.

To reproduce:

emerge -C xsm
emerge tigervnc # observe xsm isn't installed

...then configure and attempt to start /etc/init.d/tigervnc

nevermind...I added...

exec startxfce4

...to /etc/X11/xinit/Xclients and everything is hunky-dory...i.e. it doesn't fail-back to xsm anymore.
