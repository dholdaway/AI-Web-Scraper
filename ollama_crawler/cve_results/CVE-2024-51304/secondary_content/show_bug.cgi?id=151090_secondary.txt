I realise XCB support is masked and experimental, and that I should really be providing a patch with this bug report, however, I've no idea what's going on lock-wise inside XCB or how I'd even start fixing it up, so I'm afraid the best I can do is report it...  5:(

The error I'm getting is:

gnome-session: xcb_xlib.c:50: xcb_xlib_unlock: Assertion 'c->xlib.lock' failed.
Aborted

I'll be happy to test out any patches/things to try/whatever you might fling my way.  I can also provide emerge --info if it'll help any...

Starting up gnome-panel, metacity and then (via the gnome-theme-manager) the gnome-settings-daemon all works fine.  It just seems to be gnome-session which reliably fails...

Ok, one of:

* Upgrading to x11-libs/libXrandr-1.1.1-r1
* Upgrading to x11-libs/libXcomposite-0.3-r1
* Upgrading to gnome-base/gnome-session-2.16.1

appears to have fixed it since I can't recreate the problem anymore.  I'm marking this as WORKSFORME now, since it does.  If that's the wrong thing to do please feel free to reopen the bug...

Yep, Magnus provided a few patches the other day.
