FOR MORE INFORMATIONJonathan Freedman  212.778.8913For Immediate ReleaseJefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE: JEF)January 8, 2024Jefferies Announces Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Q4 Financial Highlights •Net earnings attributable to common shareholders of $66 million, or $0.29 per diluted common share•Annualized return on adjusted tangible equity1 of 3.8%•Net revenues of $1.20 billionØ    Investment Banking net revenues of $577 millionØ Capital Markets net revenues of $481 millionØ Asset Management net revenues (before allocated net interest4) of $155 million Ø Please refer to the just-released Jefferies Financial Group Annual Letter from our CEO and President for broader perspective on 2023, as well as our strategy and outlook•At November 30, 2023, we had 210.6 million common shares outstanding and 252.4 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis2. Our book value per common share was $46.10 and tangible book value per fully diluted share3 was $30.82 at November 30, 2023 •Our Board of Directors has increased our share buyback authorization back to a total of $250 million"2023 was a transition year in the economy, in capital markets, in our industry and at Jefferies. It was accompanied by the challenges and sadness of geopolitical turmoil. In the face of this, Jefferies performed reasonably well and eked out a modest return on equity during what we believe to be the bottom of the current cycle."For Jefferies, the pain of this transition was felt primarily in Investment Banking, where curtailed new capital markets issuance was compounded by a dampening of merger and acquisition activity among our corporate and sponsor clients. Fortunately, our Equities, Fixed Income and Asset Management businesses performed well despite uncertainty, turmoil and volatility."We are hopeful that 2023's results will represent a trough year and, as such, it wasn't too bad. Our total net revenues of $4.7 billion and net income attributable to common shareholders of $263 million, or a 3.7% return on tangible equity, are an acceptable showing at the bottom of the cycle, even though they are far from our goals or long-term expectations. Our Investment Banking net revenues were $2.3 billion, and our Equities and Fixed Income revenues were $2.2 billion, while our Asset Management and Other net revenues totaled about $200 million. These results pale in comparison to the heady period of 2020-21 that represented the height of free money and strong stimulus. We did remind everyone at the time that those results were unique and reflected that passing moment, rather than our new run rate. However, if you go back to 2019, which is more indicative of the last "normal" year in our industry, our current results compare strongly with Investment Banking net revenues of $1.6 billion in 2019 and Equities and Fixed Income net revenues of $1.5 billion. "Our goal (not guidance) is for our investments and progress of the last several years to position us to eventually achieve the level of results we achieved during the unique period of free money and strong stimulus, but on a durable basis, without relying on excessive "froth" in the system. We have our work cut out to achieve this, but that is the direction and objective we are all driving toward."Returning capital to shareholders remains one of our overriding priorities. In 2023, we returned an aggregate of $986 million to common shareholders in the form of $816 million in dividends (inclusive of the Vitesse spin-off) and the repurchase of 5 million shares for a total of $169 million, or $34.66 per share repurchased.1   Jefferies Financial GroupThe following information was filed by Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (JEF) on Monday, January 8, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.
