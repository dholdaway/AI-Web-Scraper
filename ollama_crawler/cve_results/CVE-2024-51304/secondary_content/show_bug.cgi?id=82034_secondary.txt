Description


Muti

I installed trac, which is a source code tracker that depends on SilverCity for syntax highlighting of source code.  The syntax highlighting component of trac wasn't working properly and a view of the log revealed this error:

13:19:45 Trac[Mimeview] WARNING: Display failed: /usr/lib/python2.3/site-packages/SilverCity/_SilverCity.so: undefined symbol: __gxx_personality_v0

This is because _SilverCity.so is not linked to libstdc++.  Attached is an ebuild which fixes this issue.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:

is this bug still relevant?

my silvercity-0.9.5-r1 installation (using gcc-3.3.5.20050130-r1) looks ok:

# nm -D /usr/lib/python2.3/site-packages/SilverCity/_SilverCity.so | grep gxx
         U __gxx_personality_v0

# ldd /usr/lib/python2.3/site-packages/SilverCity/_SilverCity.so | grep std
        libstdc++.so.5 =>
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i686-pc-linux-gnu/3.3.5-20050130/libstdc++.so.5 (0xb7edc000)
