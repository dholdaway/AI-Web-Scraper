 Inside Sps Commerce Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
A critical accounting policy or estimate is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments relating to uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.



 Other - Other   Highlight
During the last three years, inflation and changing prices have not had a material effect on our business and we do not expect that inflation or changing prices will materially affect our business in the foreseeable future.

 M & A - Other   Highlight
Amortization of Intangible Assets - The increase in amortization of intangible assets was driven by increased intangible assets related to recent business acquisitions.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by changes in the amount and timing of settlement of operating assets and liabilities, in addition to increased net income.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Additionally, the increase was due to an increase in headcount which resulted in an increase in personnel-related costs of $6.3 million.
