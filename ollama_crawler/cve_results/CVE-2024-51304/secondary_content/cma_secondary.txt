FULL-YEAR 2023 NET INCOME OF $881 MILLION, $6.44 PER SHAREFOURTH QUARTER 2023 NET INCOME OF $33 MILLION, $0.20 PER SHAREContinued Strong Credit Quality and Capital PositionRecord Full-Year Average Loans and Annual Net Interest Income Notable Items Impacted 4th Quarter Results"In 2023, we demonstrated the strength and resilience of our model as we navigated disruptive industry events," said Curtis C. Farmer, Comerica Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We produced record average loans of $53.9 billion and the highest year of net interest income in our history. Deposits were impacted by diversification efforts, but successful execution of a targeted strategy and our strong customer relationships supported stabilization of our compelling funding base. Credit quality remained excellent with net charge-offs of 4 basis points, and we continued to grow capital well in excess of our 10% strategic target."Fourth quarter results were impacted by several notable items, while strategic management of our balance sheet produced loan and deposit results in line with expectations. Our proven credit discipline continued to be a foundational strength as net charge-offs remained below historical levels, and our estimated capital position grew even after the impact of notable items."With strategic actions to manage our balance sheet, calibrate expenses and prioritize key investments, we believe we are well-positioned to support our customers and enhance returns over time."(dollar amounts in millions, except per share data)4th Qtr '233rd Qtr '2320232022FINANCIAL RESULTSNet interest income $584 $601 $2,514 $2,466 Provision for credit losses12 14 89 60 Noninterest income198 295 1,078 1,068 Noninterest expenses718 555 2,359 1,998 Pre-tax income52 327 1,144 1,476 Provision for income taxes19 76 263 325 Net income$33 $251 $881 $1,151 Diluted earnings per common share$0.20 $1.84 $6.44 $8.47 Average loans52,796 53,987 53,903 50,460 Average deposits66,045 65,883 66,018 75,481 Return on average assets (ROA)0.15 %1.12 %1.01 %1.32 %Return on average common shareholders' equity (ROE)2.17 19.50 16.50 18.63 Net interest margin2.91 2.84 3.06 3.02 Efficiency ratio (a)91.86 61.86 65.56 56.32 Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio (b)11.09 10.80 11.09 10.00 Tier 1 capital ratio (b)11.61 11.30 11.61 10.50 (a)Noninterest expenses as a percentage of the sum of net interest income and noninterest income excluding net gains (losses) from securities, a derivative contract tied to the conversion rate of Visa Class B shares and changes in the value of shares obtained through monetization of warrants.(b)December 31, 2023 ratios are estimated.
