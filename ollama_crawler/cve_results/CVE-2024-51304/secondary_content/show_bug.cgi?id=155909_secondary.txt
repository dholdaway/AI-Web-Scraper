The Adobe Flash Player version 9.0.21.55 has a major bug that freezes audio and video playback seemingly at random, an updated release from Adobe has fixed the bug. Please provide an update ebuild to the official Portage tree.

Updated ebuild

This new ebuild provides the ebuild for the November 20th 2006 build from Adobe. Only the name and one line of code is changed in the ebuild:

-myPV=112006
+myPV=101806

So use 9.0.21.78. And don't restrict bugs without any reason, please. Just leave the checkboxes alone.

The point of the this was to get the new ebuild upstream, for everyone else having this problem, not just for me. Sorry about the checkboxes.
