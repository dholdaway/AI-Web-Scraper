sys-apps/man-pages-3.16 installs a man page for tzfile(5), but the corresponding header is not installed. tzfile.h can be found in the tzcode source package used by sys-libs/timezone-data.

Reproducible: Always

tzfile.h itself says it shouldnt be installed, so nothing to do here

...
** Do NOT copy it to any system include directory.
