It would allow us to not worry about DEPENDing on xz-utils and other compress methods like rar and 7z. Also allows easy usage of pbzip2 instead of bzip2 and I see no cons on inheriting this

What do you think?

Reproducible: Always

Will inherit it next Saturday if nobody disagrees

unless you need 7z and the like, there is no need to depend on it since pbzip2 is usually supported by portage itself. Otherwise, I have no objections.

In that case it doesn't make much sense as mirror://gnome sources are only tar.gz, bz2 and xz no? I didn't now pbzip2 was supported by portage (why is then also supported in eclass?)
