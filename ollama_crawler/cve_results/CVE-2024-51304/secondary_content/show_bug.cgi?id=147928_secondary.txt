Description

I've modify  mplayer-1.0_pre8-r1.ebuild to use binary codecs on ppc. The ebuild downloads the codecs from http://www1.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/codecs/all-ppc-20051120.tar.bz2
and unpacks them to /usr/share/mplayer/codecs
It also sets this path for the realplayer codecs (REALLIBDIR="/usr/share/mplayer/codecs").

This is my first "ebuild's hack" so it could have a lot of errors :-)

You should provide a separate ebuild for it putting the files in a proper dir in /opt and then just add it as dep in a scope like the win32codecs.

I've attached an ebuild for ppccodecs, and a diff against mplayer-1.0.20070321.ebuild which uses it.

The ppccodecs ebuild installs the codecs in /opt as suggested. This is keyworded ~ppc and ~ppc64, however, I am only to test these personally on my ppc64 G5. 

Hope these can help someone.

Sorry, but I want to be sure, you tested this on your G5 running a 64 bit userland or a 32bit userland?

G5 64 bit userland ... Sorry, I should have mentioned it is really only the _installation_ itself I have tested on the G5. Real media files are playing audio only, no picture. I am surprised to get even that. I have no other media files to test the other codecs with now. 

Sadly, I don't have Gentoo installed on my G4 right now, so I cannot test there, which is where I believe this package may really be useful...

It's --codecsdir, not --with-codecsdir

After fixing my audio on, I tested this:

Audio test:
http://niceup.com/sounds.html

Video Tests (you need to "curl -s" and then use the rtsp link)
http://uk.real.com/video/

e.g.:
mplayer "rtsp://213.128.136.84/gratis/rn_gratis/X3/Whysexbeforemarriageisessential_X3bV.rm?rmsrc=&product=&service=noservice&edition=unknown" 

Mplayer mplays those videos without problems (it's just a bit slow on my G4).

I noticed that those videos are played even if the unpatched mplayer-1.0_rc2_p28058-r1 is installed. Can anyone explain that to me? Seems we don't need the ppccodecs anymore?!?

Yeah, the realplayer codecs have been added, so there's really no reason for this anymore.  Feel free to reopen the bug if you disagree! :)
