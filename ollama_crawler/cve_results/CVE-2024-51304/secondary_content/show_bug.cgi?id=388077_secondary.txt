Please post the output of your emerge --info, and confirm that your GENTOO_MIRRORS in make.conf are valid.

The mirrors i'm using have this file; for instance http://gentoo.osuosl.org/distfiles/util-linux-2.20.1.tar.bz2

The file is available on gentoo mirrors. vapier probably uploaded it manually.
