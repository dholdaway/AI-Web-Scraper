I installed a gentoo using the stage3 of 2008.0 beta1 but following the usual procedure I would just edit /etc/locale.gen and uncomment en_US UTF8, but that file didn't exist. I seem to recall it existed in older stage3.

Reproducible: Always

Which stage3 exactly ? I just unpacked stage3-x86-2008.0_beta1 (freshly grabbed from the mirrors), and that one does contain the locale.gen. Same for stage3-i686-2008.0_beta1.

Hrm, why exactly did I conclude this is an AMD64 bug ? Hardware = AMD64, means stage3-amd64-2008.0_beta1. Huh. Still, that doesn't change the fact; that does also include /etc/locale.gen.

So I don't know who deleted locale.gen, it just wasn't me. I did a emerge -uDNvae world too, perhaps it was that. I thought it had to be missing in stage3, I didn't imagine that something deleted it instead.
