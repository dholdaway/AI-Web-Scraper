If I compile gtk+2.8.8 with my currently installed libxslt-1.1.14-r2, I get a bunch of errors.

After updating libxslt to 1.1.15, gtk+2.8.8 compiled successfuly.

gtk+ does not depend on libxslt; anyway 1.1.15 is stable everywhere.

Well, bizarrely, I had to specifically pull the upgrade, otherwise I got a bunch of errors from gtk++.  In fact, there were so many that even rolling back the terminal buffer could not catch the first occurence.

So, gtk+ does not depend on libxslt?  How do you explain that then?
