Created attachment 302323 [details]
build log + 'cave info'

The ebuild for sci-chemistry/vmd-1.9 asks for the file
http://dev.gentoo.org/~jlec/distfiles/vmd-1.9-gentoo-patches.tar.xz
which gives a build error for wrong size (see attachment)

I ask again, why are the patches not distributed normally?

Again please sync, manifest is fine, patch is in proper place.

They're distributed normally, I have no idea what you refer to.
