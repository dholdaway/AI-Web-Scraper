running amarok 2.2 for the first time prompts the program do scan the collection all over again, canceling it show a window that recommends to install with right prefix.
removing .kde4/share/apps/amarok/ won't help.

Reproducible: Always

solved! running kbuildsycoca4 --noincremental did the trick

i have the same problem, except canceling it doesn't give me that window, it successfully cancels, but then starts right back up
running kbuildsycoca4 --noincremental does NOT help for me
this pretty much renders amarok unusable for me :/

i'm not using kdeprefix either
i'll try nuking the db, in the meantime, turning off "watch folders for changes" in tools -> settings -> collection fixes it (sorta)

After a logout - login amarok worked without problems. I haven't used such tricks for quite a long now so I tend to neglect these simple methods. :-)

If you updated some of the deps (in particular Qt or KDE), you may need to restart the X session.

I'm closing this bug as there has been no more reports and I didn't hit this problem with 2.2.0, 2.2.1 and 2.2.1-r1.
