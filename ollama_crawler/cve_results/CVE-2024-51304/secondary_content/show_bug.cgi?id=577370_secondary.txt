Description

Currently the toolchain and related patches are housed at

https://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo/src/patchsets/gcc/

and

https://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo/src/patchsets/binutils/

and

https://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo/src/patchsets/glibc/

and

https://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo/src/patchsets/gentoo-headers/

and

https://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo/src/patchsets/elfutils/

Can we migrate these to git at git.gentoo.org to get git goodness.  Its very awkward to use CVS to test stuff.  I'd like to be able to commit to branches for testing purposes.

elfutils are dead

gentoo-headers is just a mirror for me ... i keep the canonical patches in git already in my git.kernel.org space.

same for glibc ... gentoo has a vendor branch upstream:
  https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=heads

i might ask about doing the same w/binutils.

the concern started with gcc because of the bug #577238 where the uclibc patches need to be updated.  the idea is that its easy to test locally and create clean patches to submit.

i think we could do the same for binutils/gcc -- create vendor branches.  that'd also make things easier to manage as you'd have a tree rather than a huge patchset.

This is already in the works.

We have already successfully migrated to git for the glibc patchsets, and at the moment the plan is to do the same for the other bits and pieces. No help from infra required at the moment.
