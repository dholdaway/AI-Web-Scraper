When doing 3-d graphing in Maxima, Maxima relies on gnuplot.  When installing
Maxima, however, it did not also install gnuplot.  Therefore, I propose that
gnuplot is listed as a dependency of Maxima, since Maxima assumes the program is
there, and without it, it will not do 3-d graphing or plotting.
