Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.emerge bash-completion
2.eselect bashcomp --enable global base ssh tar
3.use TAB to try and enable completion

Actual Results:  

bash: _known_hosts_real: command not found                                                     
bash: _known_hosts_real: command not found                                                     
bash: _known_hosts_real: command not found                                                     
bash: _known_hosts_real: command not found     

Expected Results:  
Command should complete or show completion options.

Tested with:

     Wed Jan  6 22:13:12 2010 >>> app-shells/bash-completion-1.1-r5
       merge time: 16 seconds.

     Wed Jan 20 14:59:57 2010 >>> app-shells/bash-completion-1.0-r5

(In reply to comment #0)
> 2.eselect bashcomp --enable global base ssh tar

That would have shown you this error message:
!!! Error: /usr/share/bash-completion/global doesn't exist

Try `eselect bashcomp enable --global base ssh tar'.

Don't forget to `. /etc/profile.d/bash-completion.sh' too if you want to directly use bash completion in the current shell.

Reopen this bug report if you still can't get it working.

For reference, here's the short howto that the ebuild would have displayed:

 * Any user can enable the module completions without editing their
 * .bashrc by running:
 * 
 *     eselect bashcomp enable <module>
 * 
 * The system administrator can also be enable this globally with
 * 
 *     eselect bashcomp enable --global <module>
 * 
 * Make sure you at least enable the base module! Additional completion
 * modules can be found by running
 * 
 *     eselect bashcomp list
 * 
 * If you use non-login shells you still need to source
 * /etc/profile.d/bash-completion.sh in your ~/.bashrc.

Thanks, I actually posted it wrong here, I was using:

eselect bashcomp enable --global base ssh tar

Seems to be working ok, I was missing that source.

Thanks
