Hey, no fair!  ebuild foo digest fixes the actual bug (digest's stated size differs).  ebuild foo fetch is better for testing/verification :)

Commiting the corrected digests now....

The only text in this bug report was "Non fetchable", so I demonstrated that they're fetchable!  You're right though, I should have used fetch instead of digest.

I've committed new digests this morning based on fresh sources from sf.net.  Hopefully things will be straightened out now.

Yeah, my script sucks and didn't make it clear it was a digest disagreement :)
