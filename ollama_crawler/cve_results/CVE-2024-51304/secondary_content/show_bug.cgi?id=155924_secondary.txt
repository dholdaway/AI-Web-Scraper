When I done my "emerge -uDN world", I saw portage wanted to install qt-4 in a new slot. I've got qt-3.3.6-r4 (with kde-3.5.5), and I don't want to install other qt slot. The blame of this is dev-python/sip, who had got a qt dependency in his ebuild. My question is, why?

Sorry for my English.

Luis

echo "=x11-libs/qt-4*" >> /etc/portage/package.mask

Thanks, I know and done it. But Is it possible than the ebuild not try to install qt-4*? In other words, if I've got qt-3 installed, I don't to install qt-4!

Another time, sorry for my English :-)
And thanks you,

Luis

both dev-python/sip-4.2.1 and 4.5 don't want qt4 on my system (only qt-3.3.6-r4 is installed).

Luis, emerge output with --tree would be helpful.

It's installed dev-python/sip-4.2.1, and I think it is who try to install qt-4*. Look at my emerge --tree:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
galileo ~ # emerge --update --deep --pretend --tree world

These are the packages that would be merged, in reverse order:

the --deep flag says to emerge the latest version of all dependencies, including Qt.
