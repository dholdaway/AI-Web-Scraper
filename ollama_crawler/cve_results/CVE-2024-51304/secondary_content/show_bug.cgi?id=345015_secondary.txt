I had a single tab opened, some google search results. I closed this tab (a last-one) so chromium actually quit. For some reason, it crashed instead with:

$ chromium 
[21911:21911:43233629468:ERROR:base/native_library_linux.cc(28)] dlopen failed when trying to open /usr/lib/chromium-browser/libffmpegsumo.so: /usr/lib/chromium-browser/libffmpegsumo.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

The ffmpeg issue is in bug #344761, for completeness.

My emerge --info is also in that bug (the initial report).

Does the crash happen every time you close the browser? Can anyone else reproduce this with chromium-8.0.552.28?

No, I had the impression it was rather exceptional.

Can anyone else reproduce the crash, even rarely? If no, I suggest opening an upstream bug about this (please remember to post the link to the bug here).
