 Inside Realty Income Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Revenue - Product   Highlight
It has been our experience that approximately 1% to 4% of our property portfolio will be available for lease at any given time; however, it is possible that the number of properties available for lease or sale could increase in the future, given the nature of economic cycles and other unforeseen global events.



 Other - Other   Highlight
If events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment, they could have a material impact on our results of operations.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT, using historical accounting for depreciation, could be less informative.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
If our credit ratings or ratings outlook change, our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease.
