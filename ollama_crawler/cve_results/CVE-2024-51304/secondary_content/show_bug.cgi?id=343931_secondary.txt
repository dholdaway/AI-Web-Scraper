Try to run a revdep-rebuild, and then recompile gpac.
This morning I have the same issue, but when I've rebuilt ffmpeg everything compiles fine..

Unfortunately I can't tell you what package update breaks ffmpeg, because I don't have the log of revdep-rebuild (console history too small.. )

Thank you.

Recompiling ffmpeg and then doing revdep-rebuild fixed it.
