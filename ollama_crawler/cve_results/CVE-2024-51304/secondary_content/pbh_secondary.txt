Exhibit  99.1    Prestige Consumer Healthcare Inc. Reports Fiscal Year 2024 Results◦Revenue of $277.0 Million in Q4 and $1,125.4 Million in Fiscal 2024 ◦Solid Consumption Trends in Q4 Offset by Near-Term Supply Chain Constraints ◦Achieved Leverage Ratio of 2.8x at Year-End, Below Long-Term Target◦Board of Directors Authorize New $300 Million Share Repurchase Program◦Initial Full-Year Fiscal 2025 Organic Revenue Growth and EPS Outlook of Approximately 1% and $4.40 to $4.46, respectivelyTARRYTOWN, N.Y.--(GLOBE NEWSWIRE)-May 14, 2024-- Prestige Consumer Healthcare Inc. (NYSE:PBH) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.“Our full-year fiscal 2024 delivered stable earnings and cash flow, enabled by our leading brand portfolio and proven business strategy.  However, our fourth quarter performance was affected by accelerated supply chain pressures late in the quarter, mainly in eye care products, that limited our ability to meet retailer order demand.  Despite this, our long-term business fundamentals remain solid, with strong consumption during the fiscal year above our long-term expectations as well as solid cash flow which provides many options to create long-term shareholder value.” said Ron Lombardi, Chief Executive Officer of Prestige Consumer Healthcare.Fourth Fiscal Quarter Ended March 31, 2024Reported revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 of $277.0 million compared to $285.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.  Revenues decreased 2.9% excluding the impact of foreign currency.  The revenue decline in the quarter was attributable to the inability to supply customer orders late in the quarter in certain brands, the strategic exit of private label revenues, and a lower Women’s Health category, partially offset by growth in the International OTC segment.Reported net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 was $49.5 million versus the prior year comparable quarter’s net loss of $240.6 million.  Diluted earnings per share of $0.98 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to a $4.83 diluted loss per share in the prior year comparable period.  Non-GAAP adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 was $51.4 million and compared to the prior year period’s adjusted net income of $53.7 million.  Non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.02 per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to $1.07 per share in the prior year comparable period.The adjustments to net income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and fourth quarter fiscal 2023 each reflects a tax rate adjustment to account for discrete items.  Adjustments to net income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 also included non-cash tradename impairments associated primarily with the Company’s DenTek, Summer’s Eve, and TheraTears brand names, goodwill impairments and associated tax adjustments.  These impairments were due mostly to the impact of higher discount rate assumptions.Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2024The following information was filed by Prestige Brands Holdings, Inc. (PBH) on Tuesday, May 14, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.
