udev-118-r3 but version doesn't matter, no better with previous versions. The devices are only visible as /dev/sgX and there are no symlinks anywhere.

`udevinfo -a -p $(udevinfo -q path -n /dev/sgX)` output attached.

If you get only /dev/sg* and no /dev/sr* (and symlinks cdrom*) then you missed to include scsi-cdrom driver into your kernel.

Well I didn't forget, I never needed this and according to the help it's not needed for writers at all, CONFIG_CHR_DEV_SG is for those. Also burning works perfectly without this, it's other apps that expect these symlinks there.

This libata stuff starts to get on my nerves.
