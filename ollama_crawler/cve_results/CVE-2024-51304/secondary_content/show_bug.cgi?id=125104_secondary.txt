itcl's ./configure is cannot find tclConfig.sh on what I believe is a relatively vanilla amd64 system.  Or at least: I've reviewed the configuration sections of the gentoo handbook and can't find any documentation that addresses this issue.

The file it's looking for is /usr/lib64/tclConfig.sh  but it's looking in /usr/lib and in some other places that don't make sense in the context of ebuilds.

Things that didn't work include emerge -Dev --noconfmem itcl

I've worked around this issue in my case with

cd /usr/lib
ln -s /usr/lib64/tclConfig.sh

With that in place, ./configure completes, the makefile is created, and itcl builds.

But I think this is a bug.

I've not indicated version, because this is a relatively old gentoo amd64 system which has been through several upgrades -- that might be significant but I don't know what aspect of that would be significant.  

(I do have a vauge memory of having tweaked something a couple years ago that might have something to do with this issue, but that might just be my memory fooling me, and I certainly don't know what documentation to look at to find this again.  But given the simplicity of this issue I can easily believe that it's some documentation issue aka user error...)

this bug should be closed.  bug125105 should replace this spurious bug report.

please, don't make us search for information across multiple bugs.. it'd be far better if you could just post the info again instead of referencing another bug

125105 is a complete copy of this bug, with the emerge --info information in it.  I asked that this bug be closed but someone closed that bug instead.  I left things alone after that, except for the one comment, because I didn't want to get in the way.

Anyways, here's the info from 125105:

itcl-3.3-r1 is now stable on amd64. It finds tclConfig.sh in the proper place for me:

checking for Tcl private include files... Using srcdir found in tclConfig.sh: /usr/lib64/tcl8.4/include

If you are still having problems with 3.3-r1, then re-open this bug. Before you re-open it, please make sure that the system is up to date, using the 2006.0 profile, using the newest stable gcc (see gcc-config), and any workarounds you've used are reverted. Since tclConfig.sh is installed by tcl, you may also need to re-emerge tcl.
