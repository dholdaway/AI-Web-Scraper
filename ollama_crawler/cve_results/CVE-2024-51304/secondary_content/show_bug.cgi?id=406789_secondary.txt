Now there is another problem (for me at least)... With version -r2 of mesa, i got permanent preserved libs and i can't fix them... Everytime i emerge @preserved-rebuild i get the following:

!!! existing preserved libs:
>>> package: media-libs/mesa-8.0.1-r2
 *  - /usr/lib64/libGLU.so.1
 *      used by /usr/lib64/kde4/kcm_opengl.so (kde-base/kinfocenter-4.8.0)
 *      used by /usr/lib64/libgdkglext-x11-1.0.so.0.0.0 (x11-libs/gtkglext-1.2.0)
 *      used by /usr/lib64/libreoffice/program/OGLTrans.uno.so (app-office/libreoffice-3.5.0.3)
 *      used by /usr/lib64/xine/plugins/2.1/xineplug_vo_out_opengl.so (media-libs/xine-lib-1.2.1)
