http://packages.gentoo.org/ebuilds/?subversion-1.4.3-r1

Doesn't properly list the ChangeLog entry because of the multiple ebuilds added at the same time.

Reassigning to the main infra group since Marduk is retired.

Review with the new packages2. The topmost changelog entry is taken any time the changelog is detected as changed from the previous pass.

Not really a "WORKSFORME", it more like "FIXED" since the issue was fixed in a complete rewrite of the code base. But yes, the problem does appear fixed.
