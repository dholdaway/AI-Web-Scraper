Description won't tell you more than build.log.

These lines:
rm: cannot remove `conftest*': No such file or directory
appear cause most test expect RM='rm -f' and here it's simply set to
RM=rm.
/bin/sh: ./libtool: No such file or directory
error is due to the fact that libtool 2 creates libtool with configure.status,
not right after the macro.
But the final lines are strange, cause those files do exist.

Actually, I think those libtool tests can be done without generating libtool,
simly by directly testing correct variables.

OK, this is mostly invalid.
I got hit by bug 217976, with autoconf-2.62-r1 it works.
The RM and libtool related errors are still there,
but if you don't consider them bugs...
Anyway, thanks for your help.

Ok, if anybody else hits this I can add "!=sys-devel/autoconf-2.62", but I don't think that's really needed anymore.
