You seem to have same problem as in https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=505282
It's not gentoo/perl related issue though. I'd suggest to check your system environment variables for custom perl-related variables that can interfere with perl build system.

Had the same issue as described here. Resolved by fixing permissions on /tmp directory. 

/tmp was set to root:stratus but portage was not in the stratus group, resolved by adding portage user to the stratus group.
