problem looks like a prefix one.  mainline one doesn't run autotools.

Huh? The same ebuild is used in gx86 and prefix.

Something went awry during bootstrapping because in rsync's Makefile there is:

configure.sh config.h.in: configure.ac aclocal.m4
    @if test -f configure.sh; then cp -p configure.sh configure.sh.old; else touch configure.sh.old; fi
    @if test -f config.h.in; then cp -p config.h.in config.h.in.old; else touch config.h.in.old; fi
    autoconf -o configure.sh
    autoheader && touch config.h.in

I was having issues with autoconf during bootstrapping (wouldn't compile on my NFS home).. Cannot reproduce with an established prefix installation.
