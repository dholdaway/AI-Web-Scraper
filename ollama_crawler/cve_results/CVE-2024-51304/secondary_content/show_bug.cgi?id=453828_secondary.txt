Gentoo description:
dev-lang/perl:ithreads - Enable Perl threads, has some compatibility problems

This for I tried disabling ithreads when the last update of perl happened. Following days I couldn't build
- graphviz
- aqualung
- cairo

All erroring out at prephase automake aclocal error
As a normal user I just wait for the next revision release to come. But this ever the same error I eyed the given line of the aclocal file myself. All about missing:
ithreads

better Gentoo USE flag description:
dev-lang/perl:ithreads - Enable Perl threads, many problems without

Shouldn't the failing ebuilds depend on dev-lang/perl[ithreads]
?

I guess it's a dup. It not, please describe the problem in a different way.

@Torsten, yes - I didn't search for older a year bug of this matter.

But as long as that #343439 bug is open:
Why not changing the USE descripton, 
which is what my bug emphasizes.
