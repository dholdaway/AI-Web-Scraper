Q4 – Royalty revenue of $12.3 million, up 13% year-over-year, and the third consecutive quarter of royalty revenue growth





 

●


Q4 – Strategic license agreements signed with a U.S. based MCU leader for Wi-Fi 6 and with a global automotive semiconductor leader for AI-enabling software

Full year – 1.6 billion Ceva-powered smart edge devices shipped, equivalent to 50 devices sold every second, worldwide





 

●


Full year – record cellular IoT royalty revenues and shipments, up 47% and 64% year-over-year, respectively, surpassing 100 million units annually





 

●


Full year – Strong demand for diverse portfolio of IP for connect, sense and infer use cases, with 53 license agreements signed, including 16 first time customers, 10 OEMs and continued expansion of Wi-Fi 6 customer base for industrial and consumer markets



 
ROCKVILLE, MD., February 14, 2024 – Ceva, Inc. (NASDAQ: CEVA), the leading licensor of silicon and software IP that enables Smart Edge devices to connect, sense and infer data more reliably and efficiently, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023. Financial results for the fourth quarter and all periods presented reflect Ceva’s continuing operations only, with the Intrinsix business reflected as a discontinued operation, unless otherwise noted.
 
Amir Panush, Chief Executive Officer of Ceva, commented: “Our fourth quarter revenues were in line with our expectations, despite the challenges in the markets we served. I am proud of how we managed to significantly improve our profitability and earnings power through our focus on operating efficiency. Our royalty business grew for the third consecutive quarter and returned to year-over-year growth, driven by a recovery in mobile and strength across consumer IoT and industrial IoT end markets. Although our licensing revenue fell short of our expectations in the quarter, we continue to see myriad licensing opportunities for our diversified technology portfolio and expect to enhance our range of products as we push forward in developing new AI-related offerings.”
