First Community Bankshares, Inc. Announces Fourth Quarter 2023 Results and Quarterly Cash Dividend
 
Bluefield, Virginia – First Community Bankshares, Inc. (NASDAQ: FCBC) (www.firstcommunitybank.com) (the “Company”) today reported its unaudited results of operations and other financial information for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. The Company reported net income of $11.78 million, or $0.66 per diluted common share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2023.   Net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, was $48.02 million or $2.72 per diluted common share.  
 
The Company also declared a quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders of twenty-nine cents $0.29 per common share. The quarterly dividend is payable to common shareholders of record on February 9, 2024, and is expected to be paid on or about February 23, 2024. This marks the 39th consecutive year of regular dividends to common shareholders.
 
Fourth Quarter 2023 and Full Year Highlights
 
Income Statement
 


 

o


Net income of $11.78 million for the fourth quarter and $48.02 million for the year were negatively impacted by a $3.00 million accrual for estimated litigation expenses.



 
o
Adjusted for non-recurring items, fourth quarter net income increased $1.84 million to $14.59 million compared to fourth quarter 2022 on improved net interest margin and lower provision for credit losses.  Also adjusted for non-recurring items, current year net income of $54.74 million was $9.12 million, or 19.99%, greater than last year.


 
o
Net interest income increased $1.44 million compared to the same quarter in 2022, as increases in benchmark interest rates have improved net interest margin.  Provision for credit losses was approximately $2.39 million lower than the same quarter last year.


 
o
Net interest margin of 4.42% is an increase of 8 basis points over the same quarter of 2022.  The yield on earning assets increased 57 basis points primarily driven by increased earnings on loans.


 
o
Interest and fees on loans increased $5.80 million from the same quarter of 2022 and is attributable to both an increase in yield and an increase in average balance compared to the yield and average balance of the prior year. The Company acquired Surrey Bancorp on April 21, 2023, adding approximately $239.08 million in loans.  Interest income on deposits in banks decreased $777 thousand to $438 thousand for the fourth quarter, primarily due to a significant decrease in the average balance compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.


 

o


Annualized return on average assets ("ROA") was 1.43% for the fourth quarter and 1.48% for the twelve months of 2023 compared to 1.59% and 1.45% for the same periods, respectively of 2022. Annualized return on average common equity ("ROE") was 9.39% for the fourth quarter and 10.02% for the twelve months of 2023 compared to 11.99% and 11.04%, for the same periods, respectively of 2022.  Adjusted for non-recurring items, ROA was 1.77% and ROE was 11.63% for the fourth quarter of 2023.



 
Balance Sheet and Asset Quality
 


 

o


The Company’s loan portfolio increased by $172.10 million, or 7.17%, from December 31, 2022.  Excluding the Surrey transaction, the loan portfolio decreased approximately $66.98 million, or 2.79%.



 
o
Deposits increased $43.51 million, or 1.62%, from year-end 2022.  Excluding the Surrey transaction, deposits decreased approximately $360.13 million, or 13.44%, from December 31, 2022.


 

o


The Company repurchased 189,500 common shares during the fourth quarter of 2023 for a total cost of $5.98 million. The Company repurchased 768,079 common shares during 2023 for a total cost of $23.04 million. The Company recently announced a new 2.7 million share repurchase program that replaced the remainder of the prior program.



 

o


Non-performing loans to total loans increased to 0.76% when compared with the same quarter of 2022.  The Company experienced net charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2023 of $883 thousand, or 0.14%, of annualized average loans, compared to net charge-offs of $2.25 million, or 0.37%, of annualized average loans for the same period in 2022.
