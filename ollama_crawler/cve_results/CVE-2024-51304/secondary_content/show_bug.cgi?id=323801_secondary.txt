Description

after a somewhat lengthy discussion on IRC, we've agreed that the docs need a hint (somewhere around "Installing Xfce") that xfce4-meta does not include a terminal and emerging one (for example x11-terms/terminal) is required to have a useful system.

It already does; line 260 of the raw XML.

Hi Josh. You are correct that terminal is listed as a "useful but not explicitly required application"

The discussion that was had revolved around this ambiguity. That is, a new user reads the xfce config guide and expects Xfce to be usable after completing Step 2 of the document. But, in reality, they have no terminal! Gentoo is pretty useless without a terminal. So that means they need to drop down to a VT to emerge a terminal. It is suggested that this isn't very user friendly. That is what bug 323791 is about.. We don't want to force x11-terms/terminal on users but we don't want a bad out of the box experience.

What do you think?

Or rather, as the doc guru, how can this situation be improved?

And that right there is the user's problem if they stop reading. The docs are there to be read, so if the user decides not to, RESO PEBKAC. I thought "Bah, more handholding!" 

*Except* your next point got me thinking:

> But, in reality, they have no terminal! So that means they need
> to drop down to a VT to emerge a terminal.

If they do fire up startx and don't know how to switch VTs or run the ol' Ctrl-Alt-Bksp trick, then yes, they would seem to be outta luck, since recent xorg-server ebuilds no longer include xterm.

Based on that scenario, in which hopefully the user runs into problems *because* he followed the guide (and not because he *didn't* read it), I added some info about emerging x11-terms/terminal immediately below the hald info.

I left in the original paragraph further down, as it contains extra information about Terminal. Didn't want to clutter up the simple emerge instruction with Terminal's bells & whistles; the detailed description appears later in the doc.

Look okay to you guys?
