Description


Helmut Jarausch





          2009-04-15 10:05:19 UTC
        

Using tar with lzma compression (option -J) needs the binary xz.
This is contained in packed app-arch/xz-utils.
This cannot coexist with app-arch/lzma-utils (according to its ebuild)
But app-arch/lzma is needed for sys-apps/man which I DO need.
	
So, how to cut this Gordian knot?


Reproducible: Always

install xz-utils and package.provide lzma-utils

once a real xz-utils version is released, lzma-utils will go away and everything will transition to that

What is 'package.provide lzma-utils' and how to install it?
