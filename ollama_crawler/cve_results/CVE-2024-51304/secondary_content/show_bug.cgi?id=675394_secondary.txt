After an update to sys-apps/systemd-240-r3 the systemd-poweroff.service unit lacks a [Service] Section with an ExecStart so I get the following error:


# systemctl poweroff 
Failed to power off system via logind: Unit systemd-poweroff.service has a bad unit file setting. 
Failed to start poweroff.target: Unit systemd-poweroff.service has a bad unit file setting. 
See system logs and 'systemctl status poweroff.target' for details. 



Adding the [Service] section to the file solves the issue. A little more in

You can run systemctl daemon-reexec to resolve this.

Do you have FEATURES="pid-sandbox" enabled? This breaks the systemctl daemon-reexec in pkg_postinst.

Thanks, didn't know about this.

No I don't. (at least not that I know, meaning explicitly in any file and env of my root user, I checked a couple of build logs under /var/tmp/portage and none of those and my profile does not seem to set it).
