 Inside Iron Mountain Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 M & A - Other   Highlight
Due to the inherent uncertainty of future events, actual values of net assets acquired could be different from our estimated fair values and could have a material impact on our financial statements.



 Legal - Other   Highlight
•A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset;

 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
Of the key assumptions that impact the goodwill impairment test, the expected future cash flows and discount rate are among the most sensitive and are considered to be critical assumptions, as changes to these estimates could have an effect on the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
These differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
If actual results differ unfavorably from certain of our estimates used, we may not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred income tax assets and additional valuation allowances may be required.
