When trying to update from usbutils-0.72-r4 to 0.73 the following error appears (AMD64):

>>> Verifying ebuild Manifests...

!!! Digest verification failed:

!!! Reason: Filesize does not match recorded size
!!! Got: 1627
!!! Expected: 1632


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge --sync
2. emerge -auvDN world
3.

Looks just fine in CVS; emerge --sync.

Did exactly that (x86) (emerge --sync, emerge -auDNv world) and it still reports this error message. It's far from resolved. Is there anything I can do?

It sounds like the mirror you are using is out-of-date then - I got this to work some hours after I filed the bug. You could try using another mirror (can't remember how you change it though).
