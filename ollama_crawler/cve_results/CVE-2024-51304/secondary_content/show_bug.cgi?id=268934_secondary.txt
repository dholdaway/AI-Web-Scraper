Id say it's invalid.
Take a look at bug 158476 and lafilefixer.

And revdep-rebuild is your friend in any case.

Please reopen if revdep-rebuild does not solve your issue.

Revdep would not have helped at all this was an initial merge of asc thus would not have triggered a rebuild of libmodplug that still would not have provided libmodplug.la.
Didn't try lafixer though, maybe I got some time to spare this weekend.

Please file bugs for the failing packages.

This is no bug, the file was removed in purpose. Please take a look at lafilefixer, the problem is not in the package but in a installed broken .la in your system which has libmodplug.
