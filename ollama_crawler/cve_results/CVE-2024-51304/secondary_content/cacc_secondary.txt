BuskChief Treasury Officer(248) 353-2700 Ext. 4432IR@creditacceptance.comNasdaq Symbol: CACCCREDIT ACCEPTANCE ANNOUNCESFOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2023 RESULTSSouthfield, Michigan – January 31, 2024 – Credit Acceptance Corporation (Nasdaq: CACC) (referred to as the “Company”, “Credit Acceptance”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) today announced consolidated net income of $93.6 million, or $7.29 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to consolidated net income of $127.3 million, or $9.58 per diluted share, for the same period in 2022. Adjusted net income, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was $129.1 million, or $10.06 per diluted share, compared to $156.1 million, or $11.74 per diluted share, for the same period in 2022. The following table summarizes our financial results: (In millions, except per share data)For the Three Months EndedFor the Years Ended December 31,December 31, 2023September 30, 2023December 31, 202220232022GAAP net income$93.6 $70.8 $127.3 $286.1 $535.8 GAAP net income per diluted share$7.29 $5.43 $9.58 $21.99 $39.32 Adjusted net income (1)$129.1 $139.5 $156.1 $535.6 $720.1 Adjusted net income per diluted share (1)$10.06 $10.70 $11.74 $41.17 $52.85 (1)    Represents a non-GAAP financial measure.Our results for the fourth quarter of 2023 in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2022 included:•A larger decrease in forecasted collection rates The decrease in forecasted collection rates decreased forecasted net cash flows from our loan portfolio by $57.0 million, or 0.6%, compared to a decrease in forecasted collection rates during the fourth quarter of 2022 that decreased forecasted net cash flows from our loan portfolio by $41.1 million, or 0.5%.  •A decrease in forecasted profitability for Consumer Loans assigned in 2020 through 2022 Forecasted profitability was lower than our estimates at December 31, 2022, due to a decline in forecasted collection rates since the fourth quarter of 2022 and slower forecasted net cash flow timing during 2023, primarily as a result of a decrease in Consumer Loan prepayments to below-average levels.    •Growth in Consumer Loan assignment volume and the average balance of our loan portfolio Unit and dollar volumes grew 26.7% and 21.3%, respectively, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. The average balance of our loan portfolio, which is our largest-ever, increased 9.1% and 13.4% on a GAAP and adjusted basis, respectively, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.  •An increase in the initial spread on Consumer Loan assignments  The initial spread increased to 21.7% compared to 20.9% on Consumer Loans assigned in the fourth quarter of 2022.  •An increase in our average cost of debt   The increase in our average cost of debt was primarily a result of higher interest rates on recently-completed or extended secured financings and the repayment of older secured financings with lower interest rates. 1The following information was filed by Credit Acceptance Corp (CACC) on Wednesday, January 31, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.
