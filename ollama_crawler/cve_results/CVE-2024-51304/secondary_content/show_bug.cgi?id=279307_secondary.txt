Description

I tested it on VMs and real systems

Grub with an Gentoo stable system and ext4 is simple not able to start

this all appears with an fresh installed Gentoo system without doing anything

Parting --> extracting stage3 --> edit config files in /etc and /etc/conf.d

emerge -av vanilla-sources grub dhcpcd

compile kernel as i ever did

installed grub es i ever did

Reproducible: Always
