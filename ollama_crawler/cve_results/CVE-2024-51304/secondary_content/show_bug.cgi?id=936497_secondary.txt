PPSSPP does build with ffmpeg >= 6.0. BUT PPSSPP does not work properly with ffmpeg 6, as shown in Github issue #15308 (https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp/issues/15308), since the ffmpeg API changes break video playback, and the maintainer has no intention to fix it. I checked the build script from archlinux, their PPSSPP is linked to bundled ffmpeg, and older versions of PPSSPP ebuilds provide the option to link against the bundled ffmpeg, it might be better to reintroduce the USE flag system-ffmpeg, and disable it by default.

Yes, but we were patching that bundled ffmpeg which is a big maintenance issue.

If you can get it up and running I'll welcome any patches!

For me PPSSPP compiled with SDL and FFMPEG 6 runs good enough,
I tested it quickly with 3 random games ISOs I had. 
I had not played seriously any games on PPSSPP in quitew soem tiem though.

If you face some runtime issues please report them upstream.
