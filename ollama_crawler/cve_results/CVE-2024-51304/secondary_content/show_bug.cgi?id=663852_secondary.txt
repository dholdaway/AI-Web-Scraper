Hi,

Is there still any need for this package?
This package is at EAPI0 and has 2 open bugs [1] & [2]. Besides that the package is considered harmful too. from the ebuild:
This should probably NEVER go to stable. It's crazy advanced dangerous magic. It's also pure ASM, so not suitable for elsewhere anyway.

Also, the package mentioned users should go to the homepage  for instructions, but since the homepage is gone and it seems like there is no alternative (see [1]) users don't even know how to use it (there is also no help in the package itself)

Yes, I still have hardware that uses it.

I updated it including some instructions in the metadata.xml.

I'd put this in the realm of: if you use this, you should probably understand the source.

H. Peter Anvin promised long long ago to write a better way of doing this into syslinux, but to my knowledge that was never completed.
