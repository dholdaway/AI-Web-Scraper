I can not install dev-db/phpmyadmin-3.3.8.1

===============================================================
$ emerge phpmyadmin -pv

emerge: there are no ebuilds built with USE flags to satisfy "dev-lang/php[mysqli]".
!!! One of the following packages is required to complete your request:
- dev-lang/php-5.3.4 (Change USE: +mysqli)
(dependency required by "dev-db/phpmyadmin-3.3.8.1" [ebuild])
(dependency required by "phpmyadmin" [argument])
===============================================================

But php require USE=-mysqli (php is already installed and can't be reinstalled using +mysqli)

http://pastebin.com/rtJvZudn

I also tried to use the --backtrack=30

It looks like dev-lang/php[+mysqli] requires you to disable some other USE flags for the same package: maybe USE=-recode. So try that too.

Okay, if recompile php with USE = "-recode", then everything looks fine.

Thank you for your prompt response.
