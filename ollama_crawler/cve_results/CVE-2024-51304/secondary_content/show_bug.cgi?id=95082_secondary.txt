If using 'genkernel --udev all' the following options are defaulted in the .config file:
File systems --->
  Pseudo Filesystems --->
    <*> /proc file system support
    <*> /dev file system support (OBSOLETE)
    <*> Virtual memory file system support (former shm fs)
...which should allow the system to mount $ROOT

The example for rolling your own kernel shows:
File systems --->
  Pseudo Filesystems --->
    <*> /proc file system support
    < > /dev file system support (OBSOLETE)
    <*> Virtual memory file system support (former shm fs)
...which prevents booting because $ROOT will not mount and the kernel panics.

That is the Gentoo Linux 2005.0 x86 Handbook I am referencing, BTW.

I can´t see what docs discrepancy are you talking about. And leaving out devfs
support certainly does not leave system unbootable b/c that is how I do set it
on all my systems and none of them fails to boot. 

If you are having problems with udev at boot then you should add "udev" boot
option to your bootloader -  as documented in
http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=1&chap=10

Hasn't that been fixed in genkernel itself?
Anyway, handbook is OK.
You neither want nor need devfs anymore (unless you're still using a 2.4 kernel
w/ a 2.4 profile).
