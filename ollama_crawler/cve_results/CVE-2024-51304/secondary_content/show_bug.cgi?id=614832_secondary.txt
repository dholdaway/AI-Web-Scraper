Description


Michał Górny









          2017-04-06 07:32:20 UTC
        

* Messages for package sys-devel/clang-4.0.0:

 * prepcompress: ignoring nonexistent path '/usr/lib/llvm/4/share/man'


However, reading the PMS wrt docompress:

| * If the item does not exist, it is ignored.

https://dev.gentoo.org/~ulm/pms/head/pms.html#x1-14200011.3.3.11

So I'd say the warning is not exactly expected here.

This is a feature. :) If the inclusion list contains non-existent paths (which were however explicitly added by the ebuild calling docompress), then most likely this is due to a typo in docompress's arguments.

Note that the three default entries in the inclusion list /usr/share/{doc,info,man} will not trigger any warning.

See bug 260118 comment 20 and comment 22 for the rationale of this.
