There are two filename mistakes in the portage folder
media-sound/jack-audio-connection-kit/files. Two files exist:

jack-audio-connection-kit-0.98.1-configure.patc
jack-audio-connection-kit-0.99.0-jackstart.patc

To resolve you need just rename these files to

jack-audio-connection-kit-0.98.1-configure.patch
jack-audio-connection-kit-0.99.0-jackstart.patch


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge -pv jack-audio-connection-kit 
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Error telling about the some file is not in manifest:

#
!!! Security Violation: A file exists that is not in the manifest.
#
!!! File: files/jack-audio-connection-kit-0.98.1-configure.patc

Expected Results:  
Merge the package

To resolve you need just rename these files to

jack-audio-connection-kit-0.98.1-configure.patch
jack-audio-connection-kit-0.99.0-jackstart.patch

Sorry, this is a bad sync on your side. Everything is fine in CVS.

WORKSFORME, emerge sync again (if that does not help, try a different mirror).
