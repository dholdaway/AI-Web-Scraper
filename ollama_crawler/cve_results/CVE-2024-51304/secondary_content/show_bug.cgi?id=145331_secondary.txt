i havnt got emerge --info but anyway.. i ran `emerge --sync` and then `emerge gnome-light`. most packages worked, but then i got an error like this

------------------ ACCESS VIOLATION SUMMARY ------------------

unlink:    /usr/share/pygtk/2.0/codegen/defsparser.pyc
open_wr:   /usr/share/pygtk/2.0/codegen/defstarser.pyc
unlink:    /usr/share/pygtk/2.0/codegen/scmexpr.pyc

unlink:    /usr/share/pygtk/2.0/codegen/override.pyc
open_wr:   /usr/share/pygtk/2.0/codegen/override.pyc
unlink:    /usr/share/pygtk/2.0/codegen/reversewrapper.pyc
open_wr:   /usr/share/pygtk/2.0/codegen/reversewrapper.pyc

Appologies for not having a more informative error.. anyway. i managed to get around this error by running `FEATURES="-sandbox" emerge gnome-light`. 

i also had the same problem with compiling gedit, yet i have still to try it without sandbox enabled.

Good that you didn't post ebuild name at all.

Run python-updater and/or re-emerge pygtk.
