Description

My last nights sync was successful. but on syncing today 10.10.2013 I got a corrupted files message when trying to update the laptop,I removed the portage files & changed to the main gentoo portage for syncing,as the time stamps were restricting an up date. But have received the same message from gentoo-portage for the same files.
There appears to about 10 files all in the kde updates with mismatched sizes.
Could some one look at this  PLEASE

The files concerned are all version 4.4.11.1.
kdepim-meta
kmail
kjots
ktimetracker
akregator
kaddressbook
knotes knod
korganiser blogilo kleopatra kalarm kosolekalendar
kdepim-resources
kdepimruntime
kabcclient
kdepim-icons kdepim-l10n
I fixed the problem this end by rebuilding the Manifest files in each

The usual fix for this problem is to rsync your tree again some time later.
