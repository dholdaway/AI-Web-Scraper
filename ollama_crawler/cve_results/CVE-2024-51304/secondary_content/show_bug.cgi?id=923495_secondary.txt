This is the stage three log

I am trying to install a gentoo prefix on mac os Sonoma. This is x86 - 64 system, compilation was going well and I went to bed woke up in the morning and It had failed around stage 3 with an error of:

emerge: there are no binary packages to satisfy "dev-build/make".

emerge: searching for similar names...
emerge: Maybe you meant any of these: dev-util/tmake, dev-util/omake, dev-util/cmake?

Hmmmm, I was already afraid of this to happen.  Running
  /Users/redacted/Gentoo/usr/bin/bash ./bootstrap-prefix.sh "/Users/redacted/Gentoo" stage3
somewhere failed :(  Details might be found in the build log:

I have tried running it again but it gets stuck in the same place. I even tried deleting the install but that did not seem to work and now it says that my build logs are gone even though I restored them to the proper locations in the filesystem. I’m not really worried to much about that tho.  The computer went to sleep so Im worried that It might have had something to do with it. Some of the commands exist in the bin file tho admittedly they are not linked to the path but it can still run if I use “./“. I would like to trouble shoot but as I am new to this kind of stuff Im not really sure how to proceed.

I have run this script a couple of times. I also ran ./emerge --sync and that is why the output of the script is different at the end. It still seems to get stuck at the same package.

did you (re)fetch the latest bootstrap-prefix.sh script?  Due to the pkgmoves to dev-build a newer snapshot and script need to be used.

Do you know where I can find the latest Script. I used the one that was on the website https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Prefix/Bootstrap. the one I used was probably a couple of weeks old. I am not really sure how much that script is updated on the website.

The wiki uses gitweb, so that one should always be the lastest.  Just redownload from there and you should get further.

https://rsync.prefix.bitzolder.nl/scripts/bootstrap-prefix.sh should work
