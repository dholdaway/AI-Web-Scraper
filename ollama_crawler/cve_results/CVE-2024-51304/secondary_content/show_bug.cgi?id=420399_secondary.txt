Attached you will find a failed build.log for dev-db/mongodb-2.0.6 with ld.gold from binutils-2.22-r1 as well as the emerge --info output.

Hi Sebastian,

I also use this version of binutils (our ~amd64 systems are very similar) but I can't reproduce this problem.

Mind you try to emerge pcre again maybe ? Can you still reproduce this bug ?

Thanks

Closing since it's an old bug now and the ebuilds have changed since then. Don't hesitate to re-open if needed.
