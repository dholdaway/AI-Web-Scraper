Description


Ewoud Canniere





          2007-04-27 12:26:16 UTC
        

I had problems with activating DMA on my hard disk before (http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165944), that issue is now solved by selecting the SATA driver in the kernel and putting 'sdax' in /etc/fstab. (which is odd because it IS a PATA driver). Now my hard disk functions properly but i'm not able to use my CDROM drive. It's not in /dev/. The strange thing is i CAN burn CD with nerolinux but i cannot mount it. It just recognizes my recorder.
I would like to use my CDROM drive :-)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Boot linux
2.Put CD in tray
3.No CD-ROM in /dev/,



Expected Results:  
A cdrom in /dev

I think you miss the SCSI cdrom driver.
Having this activated will give you your cdrom as /dev/sr0.

I tried to enable the SCSI CDROM-driver but still i got no device in /dev. (See attachment).

Perhaps you should activate
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SR_VENDOR or CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN.
But your dmesg output just tells me you have a scsi CD-Device.

Please attach a dmesg created with your new kernel with scsi-cd-support enabled.

Please also post "uname -v" output while booted into that new kernel.

This is what uname -v gives booted in my new kernel:

alcoholica@Leviathan ~ $ uname -v
#1 SMP Thu Apr 19 15:19:49 CEST 2007

Your kernel config and dmesg output is not consistent! Are you sure you compiled that kernel and use it?

Your kernel-config does have scsi disk switched of, and dmesg tells me you booted from sda.
Also dmesg tells me kernel is from "Thu Apr 19 15:19:49 CEST 2007", but kernel config is from "Wed May  2 12:35:22 2007".

You must also compile and install the new configured kernel!

Well i did compile the kernel and copied it to /boot. 
SCSI disk support is indeed switched off because i don't need it. 
I use the ata_piix driver under SATA drivers (see http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165944). I'm no currently recompiling my kernel.

Ok my bad, i had a wrong entry in my grub.conf.
Thats why the dates didn't match.
Also the problem of my cd-rom drive is fixed now by enabling SCSI-cd-support + probe for all LUN's and the vendor specific stuff.

Thanx for helping me out with this problem.
It's a really strange notebook. It has a PATA drive but needs a SATA driver... 

Whatever, my CD-ROM works now. Thank you all
