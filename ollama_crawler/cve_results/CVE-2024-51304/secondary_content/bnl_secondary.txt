Broadstone Net Lease Announces 2023 Results and its Healthcare Portfolio Simplification Strategy
 
VICTOR, N.Y. – Broadstone Net Lease, Inc. (NYSE: BNL) (“BNL”, the “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us”), today announced its operating results for the year and quarter ended December 31, 2023, and its healthcare portfolio simplification strategy. 
MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY
“I am incredibly proud of our 2023 results, which we were able to deliver despite significant economic headwinds and capital market volatility through the year. We thoughtfully navigated a challenging environment by intentionally focusing on portfolio composition and quality which we believe will be the catalyst for increasing shareholder value as markets stabilize,” said John Moragne, BNL’s Chief Executive Officer. “We employed a disciplined and selective approach to all aspects of our investment cycle: intentionally evading risk and creatively sourcing investment opportunities that were created by the distressed lending environment and complementary to our core competencies and asset classes; maintaining a high quality portfolio of diversified properties with strong operating metrics; pruning tenant credit risk and lease rollover risk through selective dispositions with attractive spreads to redeployment yields; and maintaining a fortified investment grade balance sheet with low leverage at 5.0x, no material debt maturities until 2026, and ample liquidity to capitalize on additional investment opportunities. As a result, we were able to achieve $1.41 per share of AFFO, in line with the midpoint of our guidance range.”
FULL YEAR 2023 HIGHLIGHTS






INVESTMENT ACTIVITY
•We completed investments totaling $165.6 million, including $97.2 million in development fundings, $42.8 million in revenue generating capital expenditures, and $25.6 million in new property acquisitions. The revenue generating capital expenditures and new property acquisitions had a weighted average initial cash capitalization rate of 7.2%, lease term of 15.5 years, and annual rent increase of 1.8%.•In 2023 and through the date of this release, we sold 14 properties for gross proceeds of $200.1 million at a weighted average cash capitalization rate of 6.0% on tenanted properties. The gross proceeds represented a $35.0 million gain over original purchase price.•Subsequent to year-end, we invested an additional $12.3 million in development fundings and $3.0 million in revenue generating capital expenditures. As of the date of this release, we have $97.1 million of acquisitions under control, $98.9 million of commitments to fund developments, and $6.8 million of commitments to fund revenue generating capital expenditures with existing tenants.•Subsequent to year end, we executed contracts to sell 37 clinical, surgical, and traditional medical office building (“MOB”) properties for approximately $253.0 million at a weighted average cash capitalization rate of 7.9%. The agreed upon sales price represents a gain of $0.8 million over their original purchase price. See Healthcare Portfolio Simplification Strategy section below for additional information.


OPERATING RESULTS
•Collected 99.8% of base rents due for the year for all properties under lease.•Portfolio was 99.4% leased based on rentable square footage, with only two of our 796 properties vacant and not subject to a lease at year end.•Incurred $39.4 million of general and administrative expenses, inclusive of $6.0 million of stock-based compensation and $1.6 million of severance and executive transition costs.•Generated net income of $163.3 million, or $0.83 per share.•Generated adjusted funds from operations (“AFFO”) of $277.7 million, or $1.41 per share, in-line with the midpoint of our guidance range.

 Inside Broadstone Net Lease, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Debt   Highlight
However, a downgrade in our credit rating, or interest rate change due to governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, or other factors beyond our control, could also increase the amount of interest we pay under our debt agreements.



 Other - Other   Highlight
On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions, which in turn could have a material impact on our financial statements.

 Other - Other   Highlight
If the operating conditions mentioned above deteriorate or if our expected holding period for assets changes, subsequent tests for impairments could result in additional impairment charges in the future.

 Financial - Debt   Highlight
In addition, although we attempt to limit our total floating-rate debt exposure, changes in the interest rate environment could either increase or decrease our weighted average interest rate in the future.

 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
These unrealized foreign currency gains and losses do not impact our cash flows from operations until settled, and are expected to directly offset the changes in the value of our net investments as a result of changes in the Canadian dollar.
