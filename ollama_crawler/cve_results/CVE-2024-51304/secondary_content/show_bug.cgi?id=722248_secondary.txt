Both
http://tux.rainside.sk/gentoo/
ftp://tux.rainside.sk/gentoo/
are empty. Is it possible to remove them from the mirror list and from the website https://gentoo.org/downloads/mirrors/#SK ?

No, ftps://tux.rainside.sk/gentoo/ is alive and well; I have been using this mirror for years.
In my humble opinion, it is the best and the most reliable Gentoo mirror provider in Slovakia.
