I think Qt does some detection of whether your CPU supports various instructions, but then because you're not using -march=foo, you get this.

ok, maybe I should add march=xxx again?

Another way, maybe empty tree will solve this problem.

I have been rollback to march=skylake, the problem solved temporarily.

I will try 'empty tree' without march=skylake. May I keep this issue open when I finish this job ?
