 Inside Southwestern Energy Co's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Income   Highlight
•Taxes, other than income taxes, per Mcfe remained flat for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to increased ad valorem taxes offset by the impact of lower commodity pricing on our severance taxes in West Virginia, which are calculated as a fixed percentage of the revenue net of allowable production expenses.



 Financial - Expense   Highlight
•Lease operating expenses per Mcfe increased $0.07 for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 2022, primarily due to the impacts of inflation and lower production volumes.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
•Production volumes for our E&P segment decreased 64 Bcfe for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, resulting from our moderation of activity related to the decrease in near-term natural gas prices and the impact of inflation

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
This decrease is primarily due to lower margins associated with decreased commodity pricing.

 Other - Other   Highlight
We expect to keep a valuation allowance of $52 million related to NOLs in jurisdictions in which we no longer operate and against a portion of our federal and state deferred tax assets such as capital losses and interest carryovers, which may expire before being fully utilized due to the application of the limitations under Section 382 and the ordering in which such attributes may be applied.
