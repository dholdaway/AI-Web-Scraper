With mesa-23.1.0, kde-plasma is unusable.  No recognizable text or images, mouse pointer missing.  Mouse clicks seem to work, but not usable, since I can't be sure where I'm clicking.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge =media-gfx/mesa-23.1.0
2. start a kde plasma session
3.
Actual Results:  
Instead of the wallpaper, the background is a stripey blue and white.  Windows show up, but with no recognizable text or icons.  Reverting to mesa-23.0.3-r1 and everything works fine.  

Expected Results:  
Plasma shows up normally, as it does if I revert to mesa-23.0.3-r1.

This is an amd64 system, mostly stable with some testing packages.  I first noticed after rebooting to kernel 6.3.3, but same problem with 6.3.0 and 6.2.11.  Video card is:
  1c:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Cape Verde XT [Radeon HD 7770/8760 / R7 250X]
with dual monitors.

xorg-server is 21.1.8.  I have separate problems with Wayland, but launching a wayland session shows similar problems.  I currenlty use kde-frameworks 5.106.0 (testing.)  I first noticed this after also upgrading to kde-plasma 5.27.5 (testing) but the the problem remains after downgrading to plasma 5.27.4.

I'll attach screenshots and emerge --info.  Let me know if I can provide any other info.

Tall window on left is gkrellm, in upper right is conky.  I have no idea what the main window is - possibly konsole.  The background should be one of the default wallpapers.

All those blotches are desktop icons in folder view.  Note no file type is recognizable nor is any file name.

Is this still a problem with 23.1.8 or 23.2.1?

mesa 23.1.6 with xorg-server 21.1.8-r2 and plasma 5.27.8 all seems OK, so I'll close as worksforme, although I'll be glad to have the reason changed if there was anything done specifically for this.
