Please review this patch closely, as when creating it I let emerge extract the tarball which seems to have introduced some 'kdeprefix' foo.

But you get the idea, the same xinitrc.d snippet from ${FILESDIR}/kdebase-startkde-3.5-gentoo.patch needs to be merged into the KDE4 patch.

I too agree that it should be done at the xinit level.
It makes sense I think to have it done once at that all encompassing layer instead of relying on every session script to duplicate sourcing the files.

There was talk from http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=77504#c35 that this was indeed happening, but I could not find any archive of the discussion that Donnie Berkholz mentioned :(
