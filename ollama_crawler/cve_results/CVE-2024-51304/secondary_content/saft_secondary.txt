 Exhibit 99.1​SAFETY INSURANCE GROUP, INC. ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR ENDED 2023 RESULTS ​Boston, Massachusetts, February 27, 2024. Safety Insurance Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SAFT) (“Safety” or the “Company”) today reported fourth quarter and year ended 2023 results. George M. Murphy, Chairman of the Board of Directors, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented: “2023 saw Safety Insurance post record top-line growth as Direct Written Premiums increased by 20.4% as a result of a 10.2% increase in overall policy counts and a 10.9% increase in average premium per policy, blended across all lines of business. While Safety achieved positive trends in all major revenue streams, ongoing inflationary impacts contributed to an elevated loss ratio specific to our Private Passenger Automobile book of business. For the year ended December 31, 2023, Safety Insurance posted a 107.7% combined ratio, resulting from these inflationary impacts and several weather events. For the fourth quarter 2023, Safety posted a 106.5% combined ratio resulting from a December 18th wind event that added $12.0M in Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses as well as the continued elevated Private Passenger Auto loss ratio.”“As I have previously mentioned, Safety continues to file for rate increases across all major lines and is seeing these rate increases begin to impact earned premiums. Safety remains committed to maintaining underwriting discipline, while leveraging investments in our pricing and risk management areas to ensure rate adequacy.”Fourth Quarter and Year Ended 2023 Results and Recent DevelopmentNet income for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 was $12.3 million, or $0.83 per diluted share, compared to net income of $24.6 million, or $1.67 per diluted share, for the comparable 2022 period. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $18.9 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, compared to net income of $46.6 million, or $3.15 per diluted share, for the comparable 2022 period. Non-generally accepted accounting principles (“non-GAAP”) operating income, as defined below, for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 was $0.30 per diluted share, compared to $0.98 per diluted share, for the comparable 2022 period. Non-GAAP operating income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $0.84 per diluted share, compared to Non-GAAP operating income of $5.05 per diluted share, for the comparable 2022 period. Safety’s book value per share decreased to $54.37 at December 31, 2023 from $54.88 at December 31, 2022 resulting from net income offset by capital stock activities, specifically share repurchases and dividends paid. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company purchased 74,213 shares at a cost of $5.2 million. Safety paid $0.90 per share in dividends to investors during the quarters ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Safety paid $3.60 per share in dividends to investors during the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.On February 15, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a $0.90 per share quarterly cash dividend on our issued and outstanding common stock payable on March 15, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 1, 2024.Direct written premiums for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 increased by $44.7 million, or 22.2%, to $246.1 million from $201.4 million for the comparable 2022 period. Direct written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by $167.9 million, or 20.4% to $991.2 million from $823.3 million for the comparable 2022 period.  Net written premiums for the quarter ended December 30, 2023 increased by $38.9 ​The following information was filed by Safety Insurance Group Inc (SAFT) on Tuesday, February 27, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.
