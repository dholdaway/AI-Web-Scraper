You can probably accomplish what you want by using a postsync.d hook in /etc/portage/postsync.d

You could just use eix-sync -W, which uses emerge-delta-webrsync instead of emerge --sync. Isn't that enough?
And not everybody that has eix installed wants to use eix-sync. So there are probably people that won't be happy with your patch.

There's already support for /etc/portage/bin/post_sync in emerge-delta-webrsync, so you can use that if you want.
