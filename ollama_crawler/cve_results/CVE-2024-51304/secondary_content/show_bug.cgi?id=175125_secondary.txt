checking pkg-config is at least version 0.9.0... yes
checking for XPRINT... configure: error: Package requirements (x11 xext xextproto xau printproto) were not met:
No package 'xext' found
Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
installed software in a non-standard prefix.
Alternatively, you may set the environment variables XPRINT_CFLAGS
and XPRINT_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.
See the pkg-config man page for more details.
!!! ERROR in x11-libs/libXp-1.0.0:
!!! In econf at line 1796
!!! econf failed

That's the thing ... it looks like another of those inexplicable issues. Was libXext actually installed but missing the .pc file or was it skipped?

libXp-1.0.0.ebuild:
RDEPEND="x11-libs/libX11
    x11-libs/libXext
    x11-libs/libXau
    x11-proto/printproto"

$ qlist libXext | grep pkgconfig
/usr/lib/pkgconfig/xext.pc

It was not skipped as far as I know. Rather .pc file was missing. Sorry, i should past --info aswell, now it's not possible.

I've been totally unable to reproduce this issue any time it comes up. I have no idea where it's coming from or how it's happening, so I need to close it. There are probably a few other open dupes around.
