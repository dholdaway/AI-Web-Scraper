Description


Agostino Sarubbo






          2020-04-22 16:44:43 UTC
        

This is an auto-filled bug because dev-php/xdebug-client calls cc directly.
The issue was originally discovered on amd64, but it may be reproducible on other arches as well.
Attached build log and emerge --info.

NOTE:
To reproduce this issue you may want to temporarily move the /usr/bin/cc - /usr/bin/gcc binaries.

I cannot reproduce:

# stat /usr/bin/cc
stat: cannot statx '/usr/bin/cc': No such file or directory
# stat /usr/bin/gcc
stat: cannot statx '/usr/bin/gcc': No such file or directory

(this system has {binutils,gcc}-configp-native-symlinks[ set)

Every xdebug version in repository builds.
