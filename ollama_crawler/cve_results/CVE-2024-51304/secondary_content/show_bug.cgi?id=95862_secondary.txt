("connexion fermée par la machine distante" = connection closed by remote host)

It's ok using gaim so it's not my network connection. 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.launch kopete
2.wait

Actual Results:  
cannot keep connection to msn

I don't think your SSL errors are related as I see those on lots of KDE programs.

My guess is that the protocol via kopete changed?

I posted those errors because I wasn't sure :)   
   
It's not the msn servers changes that recently caused kopete not to work, it's  
another problem. 
 
I'm compiling kdesvn thanks to this project : http://genkdesvn.berlios.de/. 
We'll see if it's better.

Is this Bug 93213? I don´t really understand the "patch" - are users supposed to
re-emerge kdenetwork?

No, it's not this bug. 
And yes, you have to re emerge kdenetwork, or only kopete.

It works now. I've done nothing apart from running an emerge world yesterday, 
maybe the bug has been fixed.
