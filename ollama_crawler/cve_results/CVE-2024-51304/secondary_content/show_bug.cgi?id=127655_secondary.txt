When I try to change greeter theme (I have several gentoo flavours, redhat, ximian industrial and stock gnome 'flower' listed) from default 'standard' gdm theme, gdmsetup dialog crashes and I get 'Segmentation fault' error message in root terminal I have started 'gdmsetup' from.

CFLAGS="-march=pentium4 -Os -pipe"
I see no report on this at bugzilla.gnome.org for gdm product.
If a bug, this blocks GNOME 2.14 META one...

Just a user here, but one with an interest in GNOME 2.14 eventually landing, which this bug now blocks.
If this things is consistently reproducible, can't you provide more info?  A backtrace at least?

kyberneticist@yahoo.com: Sure, but I can't test (try different compiler that 3.3.x latest x86, etc) this before Saturday. If it is not Gentoo compiler/toolchain/new gdm config problem at gentoo side I'll file a bug at bugzilla.gnome.org and append link to this bug report. Thanks.

This is fixed in gdm-2.14.2. Changing themes works well. I'll leave it to gentoo devs to close, confirm, comment?
