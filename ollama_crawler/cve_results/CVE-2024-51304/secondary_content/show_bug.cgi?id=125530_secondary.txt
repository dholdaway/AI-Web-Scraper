Hi,

Please update the PEAR-Services_Weather package in portage to the current stable version (1.4.0). This ebuild is identical to the previous Services_Weather ebuild (1.3.2-r1) except for the new ebuild version and the header line.

The PEAR-Services_Weather package "acts as an interface to various online weather-services."


Travis
