The package kdegraphics conflicts with kuickshow, but does only contain documentation of kuickshow, not the actual program. Relevant lines:

# equery files kdegraphics
...
/usr/kde/3.5/share/doc/HTML/en/kuickshow
/usr/kde/3.5/share/doc/HTML/en/kuickshow/common
/usr/kde/3.5/share/doc/HTML/en/kuickshow/index.cache.bz2
/usr/kde/3.5/share/doc/HTML/en/kuickshow/index.docbook
/usr/kde/3.5/share/doc/HTML/en/kuickshow/screenshot.png
...

these are the only lines with kuickshow in them.

I´d like to get kuickshow back without pulling all single programs :-()

Seems that build and installation is connected to the use flag imlib. equery only reports installed files.
