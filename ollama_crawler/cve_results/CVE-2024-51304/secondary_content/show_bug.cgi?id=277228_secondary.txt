Description

I am following the Getting Started tutorial of netbeans up to the debug section: http://www.netbeans.org/kb/docs/java/javase-intro.html#test where I encountered the problem.
The debugger works but I can't see the text in the Type and Value columns of the Local Variables tab unless I mouse over and wait for a tooltip to appear or highlight a cell in those columns. The same could be observed in the Breakpoints tab.
Issue is also reproducible in dev-util/netbeans-5.5-r1

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch netbeans (netbeans-6.5)
2. Follow the steps in http://www.netbeans.org/kb/docs/java/javase-intro.html until http://www.netbeans.org/kb/docs/java/javase-intro.html#test
3. Click on the Local Variables tab at the lower right portion of the IDE screen
4. Expand the args variable
5. Notice that the cells do not display text
6. Mouse over a cell and wait for a tooltip to appear. Notice that the tooltip displays the text that should have been visible in the cell.
7. Click on a cell in the Value column. Notice that the text becomes visible when being highlighted.

Actual Results:  
Debugger works and displays results correctly but text is not visible in their cells unless highlighted.

Expected Results:  
Text should be visible in the cells regardless if it is being highlighted or not.

java-config -L

The following VMs are available for generation-2:
1) Sun JDK 1.4.2.19 [sun-jdk-1.4]
2) Sun JDK 1.5.0.17 [sun-jdk-1.5]
*) Sun JDK 1.6.0.13 [sun-jdk-1.6]

Another screenshot with a value being highlighted.

Notice that the values inside the cell can only be seen by highlighting it.

What JDK do you use to run netbeans? Does this also occur in netbeans 6.7?

I use Sun JDK 1.6. Haven't tried using netbeans 6.7 yet. I'll emerge 6.7 and see if it happens at that version.

Issue is not reproducible in netbeans-6.7 but the value shown in the b variable does not change as I step into the breakpoint.

Mousing over the b variable shows the correct value b should have for each step. The value column only shows #42 for the entire process.

Debugging and displaying values in Variables pane works for me without problem with netbeans 6.7 (i did not test with older versions, but i guess it worked too), so it must be some environment issue at your side imo. Did you run 'emerge --sync' and 'emerge -uDN world' recently? What netbeans locale do you use? Did you try to run netbeans using 'netbeans-6.7 --locale en'? Did you try to reinstall your jdk?

Unfortunately I can't emerge -uDN as of now due to hdd space issues. Will try to update jdk and run netbeans with --locale en.

Did the following: Update JDK and run netbeans-6.7 --locale en
Result is still the same with regards to the b variable. The value column does not update with each step and shows #42 instead.

Did not run emerge -uDN due to hdd space issues which I can't have an immediate solution as of now.

If the debugging feature works as designed to other users then we can safely assume that this is an environment issue. If so, please close.

as nobody else reported this problem, i'm closing it as it is probably problem of your gentoo not being updated. if you come to any new findings, feel free to reopen this bug.
