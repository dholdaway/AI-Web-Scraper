Description

Building perl fails during `emerge -e --system' (step 1.19). The failure looks like this (see also attached build.log),

`sh  cflags "optimize='-O'" regcomp.o` -fPIC regcomp.c
cflags: ccflags=-fno-strict-aliasing -pipe -Wdeclaration-after-statement -I/var/tmp/2007-06-29/usr/include -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -DPERL_USE_SAFE_\
PUTENV -fno-stack-protector: is not an identifier
/bin/sh: -fPIC: not found
make: *** [regcomp.o] Error 1
 * 
 * ERROR: dev-lang/perl-5.8.8-r2 failed.
 * Call stack:
 *   ebuild.sh, line 1580:   Called dyn_compile
 *   ebuild.sh, line 926:   Called qa_call 'src_compile'
 *   ebuild.sh, line 44:   Called src_compile
 *   perl-5.8.8-r2.ebuild, line 289:   Called die
 * 
 * Unable to make
 * If you need support, post the topmost build error, and the call stack if relevant.
 * A complete build log is located at '/var/tmp/2007-06-29/var/tmp/portage/dev-lang/perl-5.8.8-r2/temp/build.log'.



Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Adapt attached script for environment at hand.
2. Run script.


Actual Results:  
During step 1.19 building of dev-lang/perl fails. See attached log.

Expected Results:  
dev-lang/perl ought to build.

Some weeks have passed. I can no longer reproduce the problem, at least not on Solaris/x86. Step 1.19 completes without problems.

ok, I only had a db problem with perl, but didn't encounter any problems like this either.
