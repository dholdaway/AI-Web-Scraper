If installed with the pcsc-lite use flag, OpenCT installs an ifd driver, so that pcsc-lite can use this driver. Right now, the driver is only installed to /usr/lib. That is not enough for pcsc-lite to use this driver.

The driver has to be placed in an subfolder of /usr/lib/readers/usb with an Info.plist file. Also you need an entry in /etc/reader.conf.

Reproducible: Always

Patch improves the ifd driver installation

This patch creates the proper folders under /usr/lib/readers/usb, copies a Info.plist file and symlinks the ifd driver here. Also it copies a reader.conf file to /etc/reader.conf.d .

Honestly this is a bit too much especially considering that openct is deprecated upstream...

Personally I don't care, because I only wrote this bug report, because I wrote an article for the german community wiki (http://de.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/OpenCT; or now also: http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/OpenCT).

But I don't understand your reasoning. As long as openct is in the portage tree, why not make the existing feature work out of the box? The patch just copies shipped parts of the upstream tarball to the right places.

But, again, I don't care. If you won't want to apply the patch, then close the bug report.

Any reason to install reader.conf and not just usb bundle?
Also, I think you have a typeo, as we need reader.conf and not reader.conf.in.

I checked the changes since 2010 and retested it and it's works now out of the box. So resolved. Regards.
