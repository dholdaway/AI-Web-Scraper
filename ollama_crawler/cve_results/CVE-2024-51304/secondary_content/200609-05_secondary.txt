  OpenSSL, AMD64 x86 emulation base libraries: RSA signature forgery
  — GLSA 200609-05




      
    OpenSSL fails to properly validate PKCS #1 v1.5 signatures.
  
    
Affected packages



Package
dev-libs/openssl on all architectures


Affected versions
< 0.9.7k


Unaffected versions
>= 0.9.7k




Package
app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-baselibs on the amd64 architecture


Affected versions
< 2.5.2


Unaffected versions
>= 2.5.2



Background

    OpenSSL is a toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer, Transport
    Layer Security protocols and a general-purpose cryptography library.
    The x86 emulation base libraries for AMD64 contain a vulnerable version
    of OpenSSL.
    
Description

    Daniel Bleichenbacher discovered that it might be possible to forge
    signatures signed by RSA keys with the exponent of 3.
    
Impact

    Since several CAs are using an exponent of 3 it might be possible for
    an attacker to create a key with a false CA signature.
    
Workaround

    There is no known workaround at this time.
    
Resolution


 All OpenSSL users should upgrade to the latest version:
 
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/openssl-0.9.7k"

 All AMD64 x86 emulation base libraries users should upgrade to the
 latest version:
 
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-baselibs-2.5.2"
