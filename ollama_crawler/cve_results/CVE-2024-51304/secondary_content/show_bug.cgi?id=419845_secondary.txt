Please provide the arch and exact name of the stage. I assume it's one of the following:

stage3-amd64-20120531.tar.bz2
stage3-amd64-hardened+nomultilib-20120531.tar.bz2
stage3-amd64-hardened-20120531.tar.bz2

I can't find any issue with the stage. I was able to build less with it.
Please reopen if / when you provide information on how exactly it fails to build executables for you.
