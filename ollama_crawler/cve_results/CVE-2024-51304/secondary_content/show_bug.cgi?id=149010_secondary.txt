I am not 100% sure, but I believe that xine-lib can use an installed xvid, but it does not seem to be in the set of noted use flag dependencies in the ebuild.  (I did get video after I rebuild xine and its libs, post xvid installation.)

if I am wrong, then I think it would be a good suggestion to put together an ebuild that does allow xine to play xvid files.

regards,

/iaw

xine uses ffmpeg, not xvid.
