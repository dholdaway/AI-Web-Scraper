Trying to execute "texexec" yields:
  "the file 'texexec.rb' is not found"
Taking a closer look at texexec, it is implemented as:
  #!/bin/sh
  texmfstart texexec.rb "$@"
And indeed, I can't find this texexec.rb file anywhere on my system.  

(texexec from app-text/tetex seems to function correctly)

Yep you need texlive-context for texexec to work

Although it could be a good idea to install the wrapper only with it, I didnt think it was worth the pain. Making context mandatory is not an option as there will be complains about the mandatory ruby dep ;)

The way I'd like to go is to use raw context from upstream rather than texlive prepackaged one, but lot of work is needed here and nothing has been done yet. I expect this to clean up things a little bit.


For now, closing as worksforme as afaik texexec is a context script and you need context for everything else to work. Please reopen if there is something I didnt understand.

Is this documented somewhere / what is the logic behind needing -context to run texexec?  I have really tried to be friendly with google about this, and it didn't come up with anything useful...

well... dont ask me that ;)
from man texexec:
texexec - front end to the ConTeXt typesetting system
so I think that's the logic ;)

ah, thanks, I didn't see that one, I always go straight for the command line options :)
