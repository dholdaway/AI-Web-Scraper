If you use --ask, currently you have to wait (possibly a long time) for Portage to calculate the dependency graph and you have to look to see if it's done already.  Portage could print a BEL to trigger some noise when it's done.

That's what the --alert flag is for :)

Thanks.  I'm surprised it's not on by default but *shrug*.
