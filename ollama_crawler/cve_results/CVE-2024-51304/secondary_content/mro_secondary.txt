 Inside Marathon Oil Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Expense   Highlight
A downgrade in our credit ratings could increase our future cost of financing or limit our ability to access capital and could result in additional credit support requirements.



 Financial - Debt   Highlight
A higher level of indebtedness could increase the risk that our liquidity and financial flexibility deteriorates.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
◦Our provision for income taxes increased by $190 million compared to 2022, primarily as a result of a non-cash tax benefit of $685 million from the partial release of a valuation allowance on certain U.S. and state deferred tax assets recorded in the prior year, partially offset by lower income before taxes in 2023.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
The change from income to loss was primarily due to the partial release of the valuation allowance on certain U.S. and state deferred tax assets resulting in a non-cash deferred tax benefit of $685 million in 2022.

 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
In addition, the expected future cash flows to be generated by producing properties are used for testing impairment and the expected future taxable income available to realize deferred tax assets, also in part, rely on estimates of quantities of net reserves.
