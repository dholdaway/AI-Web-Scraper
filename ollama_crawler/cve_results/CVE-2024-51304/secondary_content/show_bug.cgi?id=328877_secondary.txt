As requested via #gentoo-dev.

Here was what I saw on 2010-07-28:

14:44 <@nightmorph> !seen grobian
14:44 <+willikins> nightmorph: grobian was last seen 2 days, 39 minutes and 24 
                   seconds ago, quitting IRC (Quit: Zzzz) and a moment before 
                   saying "grmbl" in
14:44 <@nightmorph> ....in what?
14:44  * nightmorph kicks willikins

Can't reproduce. I suspect part of the DB wasn't populated.
