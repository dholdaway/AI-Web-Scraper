Description


Olaf Dreyer





          2009-11-05 07:11:37 UTC
        

Due to some problems with our web-proxy, I'm not able to use rsync and web-rsync.
So I wrote a script, which downloads portage-latest.tar.bz2 and portage-latest.tar.bz2.md5sum and checks the integrity of the file. After that, it's replacing the portage tree and so on ...
That works like a charm. But since a few days, the md5sum and the content of the md5sum-file are different.

Looking at the directory shows the problem: The md5sum-file is 1 day too old.
If I use the portage-YYYYMMDD.tar.bz2* files, it's all ok.

The same effect happens on different mirrors.

Greetings

Olaf


Reproducible: Always
