kdm 4.3 (4.3.0-r1 and 4.3.9999) both crashes on kdm_greeting. 

kdm from 3.5 works fine for starting kde 3.5 and 4.3.

Im not shure how far this is reproducible.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.emerge kde-base/kdm:4.3
2.emerge kde-base/kdebase-startkde:4.3
3./usr/bin/kdm
-> Xorg starts and shows a kde crash screen (seg fault)

KCrash: Application 'kdmgreet' crashing... 

Expected Results:  
kdm should show login screen

kde 3.5 and 4.3 are installed. 

The system has USE="-kdeprefix".

I did several complete deinstalls and reinstalls of kde 4.3 and kde 4.3.9999 (kde-live) by set @kde-4.3 and by kde-meta:4.3 before. I did several de- and reinstalls of kdm:4.3 and kdebase-startkde:4.3 (4.3.0 and 3.3.9999)

...seems fixed (for me?) since recompiling jpeg7 several days later (without UseTheme=false). So i assume the bug could get closed.

Thank you guys,

Niels.
