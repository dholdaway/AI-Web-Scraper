The npapi-sdk-0.27.1 release changes the API in a destructive manner, breaking random applications. Please check whether your ebuild is compatible with >0.27 (and close the bug if so), or change the dependency to:

  <net-misc/npapi-sdk-0.27.1

This one's fine too, after fixing freewrl to build ;).
