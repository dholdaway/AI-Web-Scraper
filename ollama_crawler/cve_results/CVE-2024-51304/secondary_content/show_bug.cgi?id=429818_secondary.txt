fbcon kernel module shoud be loaded with nouveau, or else you will have no console at all. Here's rule for /etc/modprobe.d/:

softdep nouveau pre: fbcon

Reproducible: Always

I guess that's up to users/admins. It's not like this should be a default for everyone. Alternatives would be to link fbcon into the kernel or to put it in an initramfs, and in both these cases, you don't need or want the modprobe.d entry.
