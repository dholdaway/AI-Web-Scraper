Description

I just noticed that after upgrading kde from 3.5.0 to 3.5.1, kmail crashes with signal 11 when trying to send email via smtp (no config changes). 
 smtp server is ok, I still can send mail via sylpheed with same setup. 
 this happens on 2 updated pc's, so I doubt there is something wrong with ~./kde/... 
(I found some similar bugs on bugs.kde.org, but with older kmail versions only, often only from within kontact, which doesn't make a difference, in this case)

Werner,

I would appreciate if you would read the product descriptions next time you go to file a bug.
--------------------------
Bugzilla:  	 Bugs regarding the Gentoo Bugzilla website  (bugs.gentoo.org),
Bugs related to ebuilds belong in 'Gentoo Linux'
--------------------------

This bug has NOTHING to do with bugs.gentoo.org, this is clearly an application problem.

Reassigning...

update: it turned out I had to move out of the way (rename) my ~/.gnupg folder, then kmail would send again.
I still have to figure out what's wrong with gnupg, as I didn't change anything related. maybe some of gnupg's dependencies which were not recompiled during gcc upgrade ?

I just experienced the same, but with kde 4.1.96... 

I got the following error when running from the command line: 

----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- 

kmail(12005) KMail::MessageListView::Core::Model::findMessageParent: Circular In-Reply-To reference loop detected in the message tree

kmail: relocation error: /usr/lib64/libgpgme++-pthread.so.2: symbol gpgme_cancel_async, version GPGME_1.1 not defined in file libgpgme-pthread.so.11 with link time reference

----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- 

My gpgme was updated today, so that might be the reason: 

# eix gpgme
...
Installed versions:  1.1.6(1)(11:09:16 27.01.2009)(-pth)
