>=sys-fs/udev-152: modem-modeswitch got removed. This will break UMTS usb modems.

As of udev-152 modem-modeswitch got removed from udev. Many people with UMTS usb modems used this tool to get it working. If they upgrade to >udev-152 this hardware will simply stop working.

Commit on udev git: 4dd9b291354e76f34b0d6d7b5c3b28d03a624418

"modeswitch: morph into tool that only switches Mobile Action cables

Remove option modeswitching code; use usb_modeswitch already, people."

To fix this: Install sys-apps/usb_modeswitch.

It would be nice to get noticed by portage if someone upgrades from udev <152 to a version newer to this - so many bug reports will be prevented.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install udev >=152
2. Plug in your UMTS stick

Indeed, some pkg_postinst note in >=sysfs/udev-152 to install sys-apps/usb_modeswitch package for this purpose might be quite useful.
Udev guys, what do you think?

usb_modeswitch should be well known separate package by now, I don't think there is anything to do here
