The /etc/xen/scripts/network-bridge script has a problem which prevents it from working fine with ipv6 enabled.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.manually run faulty code:
ip addr show dev eth0 | egrep '^ *inet' | sed -e 's/ *inet //' -e "s/$1//"

Actual Results:  
10.0.3.31/24 brd 10.0.3.255 scope global eth0
    inet6 fe80::21d:9ff:feb5:d9f7/64 scope link 


Expected Results:  
10.0.3.31/24 brd 10.0.3.255 scope global eth0
