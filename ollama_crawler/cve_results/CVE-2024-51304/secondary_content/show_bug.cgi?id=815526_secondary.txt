Issue: app-dicts/dictd-mueller-3.1-r1 fetches file(s) that do not match recorded size.
Discovered on: amd64 (internal ref: guru_tinderbox)

NOTE:
This machine uses GCC-11: https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-11/porting_to.html
While the resolution of this bug may be trivial I'd like to suggest to pay attention at WHY and if it is the case of a tarball fraudulently replaced (hacked mirror).
