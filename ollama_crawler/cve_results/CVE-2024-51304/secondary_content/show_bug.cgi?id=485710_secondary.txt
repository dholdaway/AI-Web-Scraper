Description

After emerge, I get this:

!!! The following installed packages are masked:
- virtual/python-json-0::gentoo (masked by: package.mask)
/usr/portage/profiles/package.mask:
# Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> (12 Sep 2013)
# All currently supported Python implementations have built-in json
# module already. This renders the virtual no longer needed. Please
# remove your dependencies on it and enjoy json out-of-the-box.
# Removal in 30 days.

It seems this means that depclean should uninstall that package. Indeed, I get:

kdp@jansky ~ $ equery d virtual/python-json
 * These packages depend on virtual/python-json:
kdp@jansky ~ $

However:

kdp@jansky ~ $ sudo emerge -p --depclean
Calculating dependencies... done!
>>> No packages selected for removal by depclean
>>> To see reverse dependencies, use --verbose
Packages installed:   204
Packages in world:    42
Packages in system:   44
Required packages:    204
Number to remove:     0

You need to use --verbose to see the reverse dependencies.

Is this still a problem? I believe depclean does handle virtuals just fine, probably "equery d" was wrong.

I guess not.
