Description

Since Adobe recently dropped support for x86_64 in their flashplayer, www-plugins/adobe-flash does not work on such systems anymore, as long as www-plugins/nspluginwrapper (or a 32bit-browser) is not installed.
The upgrade path should be smooth. Additionaly: If the elog was not read, the suddenly missing flash plugin is unexpected.

Reproducible: Always

no, the nspluginwrapper depend was changed to a elog message in a purpose -- it's way too unstable to be dropped on users out of blue.

we can't really force people to read elogs, so that's up to the user...
