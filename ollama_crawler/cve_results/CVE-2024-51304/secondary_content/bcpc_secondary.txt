 Inside Balchem Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Legal - Other   Highlight
Changes in market conditions, laws and regulations, and key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments, including expected cash flows, competitive factors and discount rates, could result in the recognition of an impairment charge, and in turn could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations in subsequent periods.



 Financial - Income   Highlight
Changes in the assumptions such as our forecast of future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies could result in income taxes adjustments, and in turn could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations in subsequent periods.
