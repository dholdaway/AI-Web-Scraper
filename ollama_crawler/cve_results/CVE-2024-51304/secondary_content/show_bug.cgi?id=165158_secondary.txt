Description

When using this version of fluxbox (and it would appear, several others), and when bunker-one-xpm and bunker-one themes are selected, then KDE apps which use the slit cause immediate freeze.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install fluxbox and fluxbox-styles-fluxmod, then amarok, juk (I am told) or akregator.
2. Set style to bunker-one*
3. run amarok, juk or akregator.

Actual Results:  
X uses about 60% of CPU and fluxbox uses the rest.  Ctrl-Alt-Backspace works, usually, and the system still responds to SSH.


This seems to be a problem with fluxbox itself, so I'm reporting to them, but for now, these themes should definitely not be in portage until a solution is found!

Please test with latest (1.0_rc2-r2) ebuild.

Using the 1.0_rc2-r2 ebuild, the problem went away (though oddly, not when I compiled 1.0_rc2 from SVN).

Also, I tried the 1.0_rc2-r1 ebuild, and that as well worked.
