(NYSE: CMI) today reported fourth quarter and full year 2023 results.“High global demand for Cummins’ diverse set of innovative products drove record full year revenues and operating cash flow in 2023,” said Jennifer Rumsey, Chair and CEO. “Excluding the impacts related to the agreement to resolve U.S. regulatory claims, 2023 was a record year for EBITDA, Net Income and EPS for Cummins. Also, EBITDA percent improved year over year in the Components, Distribution and Power Systems segments. I want to thank all our employees for delivering high-quality products to our customers and making 2023 a successful year.”Fourth quarter 2023 revenues of $8.5 billion increased 10% from the same quarter in 2022. Sales in North America increased 8% and international revenues increased 13% reflecting strong demand across most of Cummins’ global markets during the period.In the fourth quarter of 2023, net loss was $1.4 billion, or $(10.01) per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $631 million, or $4.43 per diluted share, in 2022. The results reflect the recording of a charge related to the agreement to resolve U.S. regulatory claims previously announced in December of $2.04 billion, or $13.76 per diluted share; costs related to the voluntary retirement and separation programs of $42 million, or $0.22 per diluted share; and costs related to the separation of Atmus of $33 million, or $0.17 per diluted share. The fourth quarter of 2022 included $19 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, of costs related to the separation of Atmus. The tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2023 was negative 13.3% due primarily to the non-deductible costs related to the agreement to resolve U.S. regulatory claims.1The following information was filed by Cummins Inc (CMI) on Tuesday, February 6, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.

 Inside Cummins Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
An increase in discount rates, a reduction in projected cash flows or a combination of the two could lead to a reduction in the estimated fair values, which may result in impairment charges that could materially affect our financial statements in any given year.



 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
•Continued increases in material and labor costs, as well as other inflationary pressures, could negatively impact earnings.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Critical accounting estimates are defined as follows: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

 Other - Other   Highlight
The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default and financial and other covenants, including maintaining a net leverage ratio of 4.0 to 1.0 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability.
