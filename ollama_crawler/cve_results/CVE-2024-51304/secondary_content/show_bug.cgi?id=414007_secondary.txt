.config file

I use kdm. It now starts on tty1, a terminal screen, rather than the X window on tty7. I can change to tty7 and get into X without a problem, but of course I'd rather it just start there as used to do. Interestingly, when I do go to tty7, the cursor is not automatically in the password box, and I have to click there in order for the keystrokes to be read. 

Not sure why this behavior of kdm changed, but I did change from using fglrx to the radeon module for my Radeon 5670 card around the same time.

I am not using an xorg.conf file. And I'm not sure if this is a problem with xdm or kdm. I reinstalled all X related ebuilds (xorg-server, xorg-drivers, ati-drivers, xf86-video-ati, and xf86-input-evdev) but no cigar.

Hi Frank. I get the following output:

ConsoleTTYs=tty1,tty2,tty3,tty4,tty5,tty6
# Show the "Console Login" action in the greeter (if ServerTTY/ConsoleTTYs

There is a kdmrc.bak file there as well dated last July, and the only differences between the two are the forging seed numbers and the theme (ariya now, horos then). There are also two commented out lines: 

# "Grub2" - Grub2 boot manager
# "Burg" - Burg boot manager

Hi Frank,

It says:

ConsoleTTYs=tty1,tty2,tty3,tty4,tty5,tty6

It also yields a commented line: 
# Show the "Console Login" action in the greeter (if ServerTTY/ConsoleTTYs

I also compared a kdmrc.bak file dated from last July, and the only differences were the forging seed number and the theme being used (changed from "horos" to "ariya").

Perhaps it's not a kdm problem, but it is happening! Should I post in another forum? The problem is not resolved.

Yeah maybe community help is better as a bug.
