During jasper's build, there are many instances of:

../../../libtool: line 96: gcc: command not found
../../../libtool: line 97: gcc: command not found
/opt/gentoo/usr/bin/sed: -e expression #1, char 0: no previous regular expression
/opt/gentoo/usr/bin/sed: -e expression #1, char 0: no previous regular expression
/opt/gentoo/usr/bin/sed: -e expression #1, char 0: no previous regular expression
/opt/gentoo/usr/bin/sed: -e expression #1, char 0: no previous regular expression

... followed by:


 * QA Notice: command not found:
 * 
 *      ../../../libtool: line 96: gcc: command not found
 *      ../../../libtool: line 97: gcc: command not found
 *      ../../libtool: line 96: gcc: command not found
 *      ../../libtool: line 97: gcc: command not found

(all repeated multiple times)

Having said this, the package does seem to complete its build successfully.

Works here, assumed to be fixed. In any case of objections race hands!

Ah, it looks as if I may have mis-filed this bug: it was actually intended to be a Prefix bug which occurs when building on IRIX... or, at least, it was a year and a half ago :o

I'll post a new bug...

(Unless you did test on a platform which lacks gcc, and so this really *is* fixed!)
