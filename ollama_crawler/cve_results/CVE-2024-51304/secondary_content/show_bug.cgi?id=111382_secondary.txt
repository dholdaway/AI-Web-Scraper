Description

I trued to use the search feature on the front of the page to look up an issue I
may be having that I believe to be a bug.  I typed in "alsa" and it said "not an
alias or bug number" (or something very similar thereto) and then I tried "ALL
alsa" and got the same problem.  I can't look up my bug to see if it IS a bug or
just me being stupid, as it seems the search feature is broken

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.search for alsa
2.search for ALL alsa
3.slap your forehead

Actual Results:  
I got an error that alsa was neither a bug number nor an alias to a specific bug
numberq

Expected Results:  
searched for all bugs that pertain to alsa

Restart your browser, you have some crap in memory/cache. :)
