As per #gentoo-infra 's topic: "first file a bug please, then complain here about broken stuff"

I can't comment on the various bug, the search works sometimes and I can't file bugs, I hope I will able to file it.

Care to be a bit more specific?

1)pybugz is unable to log in
2)sometimes when I comment it goes to timeout
3)when bugz is able to log in, it is not able to post the bug, always connection timed out.

There are no issues with the web interface and also not enough details.
What pybugz version? Error logs? Timestamps? What backend(s)?

So for now I'll assign to the maintainer.

pybugz, at least until now, uses the same methods as a browser does. JSON/XMLRPC support was/is planned but not yet implemented so right now it sounds like a pybugz problem.

I can reproduce the problems both via web and pybugz, so is not a pybugz problem and you don't need the details about pybugz.

+1 occasional unavailability of the website (browser access). I hit it 1-2x/week.

Speaking of Bugzilla: it seems to only assign even numbers to newly created bugs. That didn't happen in the past. If it's not a feature, please, let me know - I'll open a separate # for it.

I need details about the actual problem.

There are evens and odds, depending on the node (DB). That was always the case, at least since I joined Gentoo Infra.

I ran into timeouts on the web interface a few times yesterday when trying to open a show_bug link. I'm not sure what kind of information I can really give about a page timing out.

Would it help if I kept a log of when it happens?

I am also definitely having intermittent timeout issues with
bugzilla, both from the web site and using pybugz.

In that case, can't the outages and the even numbers be connected? Looks like one of those DB nodes may have been out for quite a long time now. Take a look at the bug numbers in the past half a year. Not a single odd number there.

No.

We haven't had any reports about a continued unavailability, thus closing.
