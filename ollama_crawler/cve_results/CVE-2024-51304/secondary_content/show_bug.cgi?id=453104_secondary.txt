Description

while emerging app-shells/dash i get the following error:

***** automake *****
***** PWD: /var/tmp/portage/app-shells/dash-0.5.7.3-r1/work/dash-0.5.7
***** automake --add-missing --copy --foreign

configure.ac:2: version mismatch.  This is Automake 1.11.6,
configure.ac:2: but the definition used by this AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE
configure.ac:2: comes from Automake 1.10.3.  You should recreate
configure.ac:2: aclocal.m4 with aclocal and run automake again.

after running emerge automake:1.10 everything works out fine.

I can *not* confirm this: dash-0.5.7.3-r1 compiles fine here, and I have only automake-1.12.6 (and automake-1.13.1) installed.

Maybe there is a particular issue with automake-1.11 only...

Or perhaps you have to reemerge libtools (I have 2.4.2) or gnuconfig (I have 20121010).

the funny thing is that after unmerging automake:1.10 i can still install dash fine. IIRC i've had this weird issue with some other package and never found out what was happening. seems like the same this time ;-)

I had such issues also (but last time was many years ago): In such cases, it was usually sufficient to reemerge libtool - this seemed to include code from some installed version of automake when emerged.
