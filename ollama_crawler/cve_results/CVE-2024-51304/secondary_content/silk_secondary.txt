Silk Road Medical Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results and 


Provides 2024 Financial Outlook


﻿


SUNNYVALE, Calif., Feb. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Silk Road Medical, Inc. (Nasdaq: SILK), a company focused on reducing the risk of stroke and its devastating impact, today reported financial results for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2023.


﻿


“With the right team in place, broad reimbursement, and extensive evidence in support of TCAR, we are laser focused on deepening adoption in physicians who perform TCAR,” said Chas McKhann, CEO of Silk Road Medical. “My experience thus far at Silk Road has only served to further validate the vast opportunity that we see for TCAR to benefit many more patients with carotid artery disease, and I’m excited by the underlying progress we are already making towards that end.”


﻿


Recent Business Highlights



 ·



Completed more than 25,000 TCAR procedures in 2023, bringing the cumulative total to over 85,000 


 ·



Received expanded coverage for TCAR under a revised national coverage decision issued by CMS, further expanding access to TCAR and reducing administrative barriers 


 ·



Initiated the limited market release of new tapered configurations for the Company’s ENROUTE Transcarotid Stent System


 ·



Executed distribution agreements with Medico’s Hirata in Japan and Genesis MedTech Group in China following clearance for the Company’s ENROUTE Stent and ENROUTE Neuroprotection System in both countries

﻿


Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial ResultsRevenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $47.3 million, an increase of $7.2 million or 18%, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Growth was driven primarily by increased TCAR adoption.


﻿


Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $34.8 million compared to $29.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2023 increased to 74% compared to 73% for the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to an increase in production volumes.


﻿


Operating expenses were $49.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $41.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, which represents an increase of 18%. The increase was primarily driven by increased headcount.


﻿


Net loss was $13.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, or a loss of $0.33 per share, as compared to a loss of $12.6 million, or $0.34 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2022.

 Inside Silk Road Medical Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Revenue - Product   Highlight
However, any decreases in our key performance indicators could have a negative impact on our future revenue, as could other factors, such as price pressures, increased labor costs, labor and staffing shortages, hospital capacity and patient behavior caused by COVID-19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, and increased competition.



 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
Because of these and other factors, we expect to continue to incur substantial net losses and negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future.

 Financial - Debt   Highlight
The events of default under the Loan Agreement include, among others, payment defaults, material misrepresentations, breaches of covenants, cross defaults with certain other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, and judgment defaults.

 Other - Other   Highlight
As a result of the expansion of coverage in NCD 20.7 and CMS’s stated goals for broader patient access, we believe there could be rising interest and awareness in minimally invasive carotid stenting procedures including TCAR.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
In addition, possible resurgences of COVID-19 and new virus variants may negatively impact our gross margin in the near term due to unfavorable production variances as a result of lower production and lower demand.
