 Inside Acushnet Holdings Corp.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements.



 Other - Other   Highlight
If actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Macroeconomic factors could impact our results of operations in ways we cannot currently predict.

 M & A - Other   Highlight
Additionally, from time to time, we may make strategic acquisitions and investments to complement our products, technologies or businesses, which could impact our liquidity needs.

 Other - Other   Highlight
