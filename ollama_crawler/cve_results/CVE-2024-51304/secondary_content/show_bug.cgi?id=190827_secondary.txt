Description

When I try to print to a remote CUPS server from epiphany or evince, the print button is greyed out.

I've set up the local machine to use a remote CUPS server, by putting the name of the server on the ServerName line in the /etc/cups/client.conf file.

Running "lpstat -a" lists the name of the printer on the remote server.

Firefox can print to the remote server (it screws up when scaling graphics, but I don't think that's related to this bug).

The remote printer shows up in the list of available printers in epiphany and evince.

If I print to a file, the print button ungreys itself, and greys out if I re-select the remote printer.

I'm not running a cups server on the client machine, but I tried it with a server running also, and it made no difference.

I'm up to date with stable gnome and cups on the client and server as of yesterday.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. publish CUPS printer on server
2. point client to remote server in /etc/cups/client.conf
2. start epiphany/evince on client
3. try to print something from epiphany/evince on the remote printer
Actual Results:  
note the insensitive print button in the print dialog.

Expected Results:  
clickable print button and spiffy hardcopy coming out of the server's printer.

I notice gtk+ 2.10.4 fails to  merge with cups 1.3 which is in this bugzilla

This works on my stable machine. If this bug is still an issue, try enabling local browsing in your cups config file (but I'm pretty sure that it's the default anyway).

Thanks
