Hello Kevin,

can you run firefox from terminal (`firefox`) and watch if there's any output during this crash? Any library load error? You can check `dmesg` output, too.

Is `revdep-rebuild --ignore` (app-portage/gentoolkit) clean?

On a side note: I recommend `wget -O <filename> <URL>` to just download that page.

Michael

Yes.  Firefox starts clean from the terminal.

What's really annoying is that the bug (which was completely repeatable when filed) is not any more.  The page loads and "save as"-es just fine.  Thanks
for the quick reply, and if this comes up again, I'll try to gather more info.

BTW: I always do a revdep-rebuild and confirm bugs before I file them.  This was
no exception.

Plus, I don't think anything was updated since yesterday (bug filing day) because I've been 'way too busy for such.  I did do a reboot when my screen went dark and I couldn't get it back.  Maybe the reboot fixed it, but I couldn't
figure out anything less severe than the RESET button.  So something was seriously hosed, and will run okay for a while.  This was this morning, many hours after noting the bug.

I guess I may as well mark it "works for me", pending better info.

I hate bugs like this.

That's perfect behavior, but not all users even know about it.

Sadly these bugs were hard to trace down. I assumed a problem displaying the "Save As" dialog box from your Desktop Environment. Hm, maybe your ~/.xsession-errors contains some info. AFAIK, this is the place where the output of all "spp launcher" started apps end up. But it gets rotated and the lines carry no timestamps.

> I hate bugs like this.
No problem!

Thanks for the reply.  I've instituted an hourly cron job that introduces a `date` into .xsession-errors every hour, just in case I need it later.  There's so much stuff in there, I gave up trying to guess where this happened.

I agree this is a likely place in case it happens again, because the save-as dialog did not come up.
