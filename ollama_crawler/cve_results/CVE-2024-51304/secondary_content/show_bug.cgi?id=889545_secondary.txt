I've seen we have a bugzilla for openrc and the github issues here... Should we unify the issue form? Where should I report an issue?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Opening https://github.com/issues
2. Opening https://bugs.gentoo.org/buglist.cgi?component=OpenRC&list_id=6673767&product=Gentoo%20Hosted%20Projects&resolution=---
Actual Results:  
You cannot understand which one use

The upstream readme is pretty clear.
The only reason the OpenRC component exists on this  bugzilla is that
OpenRC was originally a gentoo hosted project. We changed that when it
started being used by other distros so it would be easier to accept
contributions from them.

if we wanted to drive people to the GH tracker more, we could do things like:

* drop "OpenRC" from the new bug template: https://bugs.gentoo.org/enter_bug.cgi

* add upstream info to the component description: https://bugs.gentoo.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Gentoo%20Hosted%20Projects
it just says "OpenRC bugs belong here." atm.
