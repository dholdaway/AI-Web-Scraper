 Inside Chesapeake Energy Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require us to make estimates and assumptions.



 Revenue - Product   Highlight
The decrease in Marcellus and Haynesville of $4.739 billion was primarily due to a decrease in revenues from lower average prices received.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Changes in natural gas, oil or NGL prices could result in actual results differing significantly from our estimates.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Accounting guidance for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions requires that a more likely than not threshold condition be met on a tax position, based solely on its technical merits of being sustained, before any benefit of the uncertain tax position can be recognized in the financial statements.

 Other - Other   Highlight
We also routinely assess potential uncertain tax positions and, if required, establish accruals for such positions.
