Description

As summary.

I've tried both i686 and x86_64 mingw-w64, and using the winnt profile (and subdirs) as make.profile in /usr/$sysroot/etc/portage, and copying the embedded profile and modifying it as the wiki suggests.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge crossdev
2. Various instructions followed exactly from the wiki
3. crossdev -t {i686,x86_64}-w64-mingw32
4a. ln -s /usr/portage/profiles/prefix/windows/winnt /usr/$ARCH-w64-ming32/etc/portage/make.profile
5a. emerge sys-libs/zlib

4b. copy the embedded profile, remove ARCH, ELIBC, KERNEL from PROFILE_ONLY
5b. set said variables in profile/make.profile
6b. emerge zlib

Actual Results:  
a. ARCH is not set/make.profile symlink complaints
b. make -f win32/Makefile.gcc no such file when it does exist


Expected Results:  
Compiled and installed zlib to my prefix
