I need rfcomm to bind to bluetooth gps.

When I search for rfcomm via e-file, it shows me net-wireless/bluez but that tool is not built. I looked at the ebuild file but there is no hint how to build that tool.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. build net-wireless/bluez
2. try to bind a interface (eg rfcomm bind /dev/rfcomm0 00:0D:B5:61:1F:1C)
Actual Results:  
rfcomm is not found

Expected Results:  
Device is bound and /dev/rfcomm0 is available

Haven't tried, but a grep to the makefile shows:

@DEPRECATED_TRUE@@TOOLS_TRUE@ tools/rfcomm

So I assume it's gated behind USE=deprecated

(..so it'll probably go away forever sooner or later, but for now you can still get it)

Ah, sorry, didn't search in the make file, only in the ebuild.

However, when it will go away, I would better migrate to another, stable, way to bind devices to /dev/rfcomm0.

Is there any tool that replaces rfcomm? I didn't find any hint about that.

(That might be not the topic for a bug report, however, maybe you have an answer.)

Not me, I never used rfcomm so I wouldn't know.

We will keep it under "deprecated" I think (following upstream)
