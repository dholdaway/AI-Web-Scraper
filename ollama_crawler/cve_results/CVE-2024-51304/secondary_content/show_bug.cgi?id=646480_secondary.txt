Every time I try to save a Gentoo wiki article after editing it I get the following error message:

> A database query error has occurred. This may indicate a bug in the software.

Reproducible: Always

I still get this problems. For example now I can't add a discussion to the talk page of the Gentoo Wiki Copyrights article: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Gentoo_Wiki_talk:Copyrights

Have you tried recently? I believe this issue was caused by a caching issue, or you accessed the wiki while our infra was under heavy load.

Next time try:
1. Pressing CTRL+F5 to refresh the browser.
2. Try again in a few minutes.

I can't reproduce, so if this is still an issue for you please re-open the bug again.

We're planning some wiki updates soon (perhaps this weekend), so I'm thinking things should get a bit faster, even under heavy load.

A few days ago I made some improvements to the Gentoo wiki without experiencing this problem. So I think we can consider it resolved.
