 Inside Parsons Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
We consider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if the policy or estimate requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time they were made and if changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.



 Legal - Other   Highlight
However, these claims may be resolved at amounts that differ from our current estimates, which could result in increases or decreases in future estimated contract profits or losses.

 Other - Other   Highlight
In the event that we determine that our goodwill is impaired, we would be required to record a non-cash charge that could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit.

 Legal - Other   Highlight
Losses are accrued based upon our estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred using historical experience and certain actuarial assumptions, as provided by an independent actuary.
