Description

I used a shameless copied 1.2 ebuild (renamed to -9999) to use the latest git sources I do have here at my system.

I had to replace 
-e 's/-g -O2//' \
by
-e 's/-g -O2/-O2/' \


because otherwise I do get the following build error at a 32 bit x86 system :

...
gcc -Wall -W  -I. -Iinclude/ -Wimplicit  -D_GNU_SOURCE -Wdeclaration-after-statement -Wformat=2 -Winit-self -Wlogical-op -Wnested-externs -Wpacked -Wshadow -Wstrict-aliasing=3 -Wswitch-default -Wswitch-enum -Wundef -Wwrite-strings -Wstrict-prototypes -Wmissing-prototypes -o syscall.o -c syscall.c

...

syscall.c: In function ‘syscall32’:
syscall.c:92:1: error: bp cannot be used in asm here
make: *** [syscall.o] Error 1
make: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....
 * ERROR: dev-util/trinity-9999::toralf failed (compile phase):



FWIW the original ebuild-1.2 works fine with 1.2 sources, so this is just a heads up.

Why aren't you just using the live ebuild in the tree?

Closing since I can't reproduce the issue with the current live ebuild in the tree.

If you can, reopen and add emerge --info and the failing build log to the bug.

The live ebuild works fine.

I won't install git at all user mode linux images - or can I fake a live ebuild by telling them something like "here take this file as the git archive" ?
