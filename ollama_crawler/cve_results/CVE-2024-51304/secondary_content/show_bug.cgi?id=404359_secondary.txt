Since there are unresolved issues with python-3.2.2 (#395495) the ebuild should not have any non-testing keyword. However, it has amd64 which leads to it being installed on AMD instead of 3.1.4-r3, triggering the #395495 bug.

I don't think known problems in the test suite should block stabilization; passing the test suite is a way of testing the actual code. Passing the tests, by itself, is not a very useful goal.
