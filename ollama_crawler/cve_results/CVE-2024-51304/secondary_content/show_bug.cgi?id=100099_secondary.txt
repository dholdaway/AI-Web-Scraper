Description


Timo Nentwig

After a simple emerge xfce4 the settings dialog (xfce-settings-show actually)
does not work, i.e. it does *very* shortly show up and disappears instantly
without any message.

I noticed that XDB_DATA_DIRS is not defined. However export
XDB_DATA_DIRS=/usr/share/:/usr/local/share/:/usr/kde/3.4
/share/ didn't realyl solve the problem


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge xfce4
2. login as ordinary user
3. xfce-settings-show

Can't reproduce locally, can you re-open if it still happens in 4.2.3.2. Thanks.
