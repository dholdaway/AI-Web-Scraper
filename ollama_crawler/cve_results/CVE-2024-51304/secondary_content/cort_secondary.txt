Our strong 2023 commercial results reflect that physicians are more regularly screening for hypercortisolism. The results demonstrate our ability to support these physicians as they manage this complex disease. We are confident these trends will continue and are reiterating our 2024 revenue guidance of $600 – $630 million,” said Joseph K.

 Inside Corcept Therapeutics Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
We have never experienced a material lack of access to cash or material realized losses.



 Financial - Shares   Highlight
If we were to raise funds, equity financing would be dilutive, debt financing could involve restrictive covenants and funds raised through collaborations with other companies may require us to relinquish certain rights in our product candidates.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
The increase for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to increased employee compensation expenses and legal fees.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
We assess our inventory levels at each reporting period and write down inventory that is either expected to be at risk of expiration prior to sale, has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value, or for which there are inventory quantities in excess of expected requirements.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Patients taking these medications experience a 10 to 25-year reduction in life expectancy, due largely to increased cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes.
