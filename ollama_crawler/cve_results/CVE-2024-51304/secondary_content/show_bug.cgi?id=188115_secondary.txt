Description

          2007-08-08 14:32:27 UTC
        

in my machine (ibook g4 1.33ghz, Linux iori 2.6.21-gentoo-r2 #2 PREEMPT Thu Jul 26 20:17:44 ART 2007 ppc 7447A, altivec supported PowerBook6,7 GNU/Linux) i emerged python 2.4.4 and during byte compiling there were some syntax errors that may  have broken a few things on the python final install.This seems to be a tab instead of spaces or windows editor error for what i saw.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Get a machine like mine (perhaps happens on other archs)
2.emerge python (2.4.4 currently)
3.watch the output

Horacio, please post the output of 'emerge --info'.

The only package I see broken is dev-python/bicyclerepair, were there any others?
What version of bicyclerepair are you using?
