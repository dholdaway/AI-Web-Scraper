!!! x11-drivers/ati-drivers-14.12 has fetch restriction turned on.
!!! This probably means that this ebuild's files must be downloaded
!!! manually.  See the comments in the ebuild for more information.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge ati-drivers for 14.12 failed, needed for kernel 3.17
2.
3.

I didn't miss it. With fetch restriction no fetch is actualy done...
Here some other files are needed that appearantly are not under fetch restriction. and that fail...

Hm did you miss that these are gentoo distfiles?

 http://gentoo.osuosl.org/distfiles/amd-catalyst-omega-14.12-linux-run-installers.zip
 http://gentoo.ussg.indiana.edu/distfiles/amd-catalyst-omega-14.12-linux-run-installers.zip


without mentioning What file is actualy needed and from where?
At leas jdk from oracle refers one to the oracle site....
This one only points to failed gentoo distfiles, no ati site or whatever....

So this is either:
- missing files
- pointing to the wrong spot
- bad ebuild....
