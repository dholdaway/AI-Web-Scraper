2009-03-23: wpa_supplicant 0.6.9 was released!

Also 0.6.X is considered as a stable release now.

But still, please put 0.5.11 (last "Older stable release") in the tree, as long as some wireless cards (e.g. my rtl8185L) do not work with 0.6.X!

With wpa-supplicant-0.6.9 rtl8180b chip is working, not very stable but working.

Together with gentoo-sources-2.6.28-r5, I dropped irqpoll kernel options and it is still working.
