Does this have anything to do with bug #172860 or is this something completely different?
I just wanted to say that there is a bug fix release for STLport upstream, but I doubt is has any fixes for this issue and the bug #172860 issue. The newer version of STLport is 5.1.1 (5.1.2 has only Windows related fixes).

@Luca: Is this still an issue with 2.2.0?

Looks like it is solved with 2.2 or maybe with the clean setup I had to prepare.
