If I emerge media-gfx/hugin with ~amd64 it builds and installs media-gfx/hugin-2017.0 without any errors. But after that it's missing /usr/bin/hugin.

Building media-gfx/hugin-2016.2.0 works.

I can confirm this but also found at least in my case the culprit.

Comparing the sources of hugin-2016.2.0 and hugin-2017.0.0 with kdiff3 I found in CMakeLists.txt of hugin-2017 that it requires WxWidgets 3.0 or above while the previous one had a requirement of 2.8 or above.

So I changed with eselect the wxwidgets profile from "gtk2-unicode-release-2.8" to "gtk2-unicode-3.0", rebooted my machine (I forgot how to make the changes in the current session active), recompiled and after that hugin-2017 worked :-)

Thank you very much
