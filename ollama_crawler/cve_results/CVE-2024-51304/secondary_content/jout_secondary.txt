EXHIBIT 99.1Johnson Outdoors Reports Results for Fiscal Year 2023
RACINE, Wis., Dec.  08, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Johnson Outdoors Inc. (Nasdaq:JOUT), a leading global innovator of outdoor recreation equipment and technology, today announced lower revenue and earnings for the fiscal year ending September 29, 2023. Fiscal 2023 sales fell 11 percent compared to the previous year, while operating profit decreased $54.6 million, or 82 percent, and net income fell $25.0 million, or 56 percent, over the prior fiscal year. “The end of the elevated pandemic-driven demand of the past few years, combined with higher inventory levels at retail, resulted in lower sales and profits for our 2023 fiscal year. Our fiscal fourth quarter was particularly impacted by significantly slower demand,” said Helen Johnson-Leipold, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Heading into fiscal 2024, we are working hard to outperform the challenging marketplace and improving our profitability profile. We’re excited about new innovation announced this year, including Minn Kota®’s new line of motors and Old Town®’s award-winning power-assisted pedal drive boat. We will continue to invest in innovation to keep our brands strong, and to maximize opportunities to enhance the long-term growth and profitability of all our businesses.” FISCAL 2023 HIGHLIGHTS Announced broad line of new, innovative products in FishingReceived ICAST award for cutting-edge technology in Watercraft RecreationMaintained debt-free balance sheet and strong cash positionIncreased quarterly dividend to shareholders FISCAL 2023 RESULTSTotal Company revenue fell 11 percent to $663.8 million versus fiscal 2022 revenue of $743.4 million. Key factors in the year-over-year comparison were: Fishing revenue decreased 6 percent as demand moderated to pre-pandemic levelsDiving sales increased 8 percent, comparing favorably to the prior fiscal year, due to strong performance in a recovering marketCamping decreased $25.0 million due primarily to a significant decline in demand as well as the sale of the Military and Commercial tents product lines in the fiscal second quarterWatercraft Recreation sales decreased $27.2 million, reflecting significant reductions in the overall market demand Total Company operating profit was $11.7 million in fiscal 2023, which compared unfavorably to operating profit of $66.3 million in the prior fiscal year due to the lower sales volumes and a $27.3 million increase in operating expenses. Deferred compensation expense increased $9.1 million as a result of marking plan assets to market and was entirely offset in Other Income. Additionally, higher warranty expense, investments in research and development costs, and higher marketing and professional services costs further drove the operating expense increase versus fiscal 2022. Profit before income taxes was $25.8 million in fiscal 2023, compared to $58.9 million in fiscal 2022. Other Income improved by $17.8 million over the prior year due primarily to improved gains on deferred compensation plan assets (offset in operating expenses as noted above) and a $6.6 million gain on the sale of Military and Commercial Tents. Net income for the fiscal year fell to $19.5 million, or $1.90 per diluted share, a 56 percent decline versus $44.5 million, or $4.37 per diluted share, in the last fiscal year. The effective tax rate was 24.4 percent compared to the previous fiscal year’s rate of 24.4 percent. FOURTH QUARTER RESULTSTotal Company net sales in the fiscal fourth quarter were $96.3 million, a $100.1 million decrease from the prior fiscal year fourth quarter’s sales of $196.4 million. Operating loss of $22.6 million in the current year fourth quarter declined from operating profit of $13.3 million in the prior year fourth quarter. Gross profit declined from the prior year quarter due to lower sales, increased inventory reserves, and unfavorable overhead absorption. Operating expenses decreased $4.3 million due primarily to a reduction in sales volume-driven expenses and lower incentive compensation expense. Loss before income taxes was $22.1 million in the current year quarter, compared to profit before income taxes of $11.8 million in the prior year fourth quarter. Net loss for the fourth quarter was $16.0 million compared to net income of $9.7 million in fiscal 2022. OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION The Company reported cash and investments of $152.6 million as of September 29, 2023, a $22.8 million increase from the prior year, with no debt on its balance sheet. Depreciation and amortization were $16.3 million compared to $14.2 million in fiscal 2022. Capital spending totaled $22.7 million in fiscal 2023 compared with $31.7 million in fiscal 2022. In September 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a 3 percent increase in the quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of record as of October 13, 2023, which was payable on October 27, 2023. “Heading into fiscal year 2024, we’re focused on carefully managing higher-than-normal inventories and improving profitability with a defined cost savings program in place and prudent expense management,” said David W. Johnson, Chief Financial Officer. “The balance sheet remains debt-free and our healthy cash position enables us to continue investing in strategic opportunities to strengthen the business and consistently pay dividends to shareholders.” WEBCAST The Company will host a conference call and audio web cast at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Friday, December 8, 2023.
