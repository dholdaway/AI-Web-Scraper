As the version 0.8.6 in portage is pretty old, here is an update for the latest release from yesterday.
I putted all arch into the KEYWORDS from which I know that sipsak compiles and runs on. Theoretically it could/should be extended to all Gentoo arch's.

Meanwhile someone already update sipsak in portage. Unfortunately He did not checked for a new ebuild, because the one in portage contains errors. Will fill a new bug for that.
