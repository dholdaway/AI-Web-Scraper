 Inside Solarwinds Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
We continuously monitor the direct and indirect impacts of these events on our business and financial results, as well as the overall global economy, and we anticipate that these macroeconomic events could continue to negatively impact our results of operation.



 Other - Other   Highlight
On October 1, 2023, we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis and assessed the above qualitative factors, including the increase in our market capitalization, along with several events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of our reporting unit.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
If an event occurs that would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our property and equipment, operating lease assets, capitalized software development costs or our finite-lived intangibles and other assets, that revision could result in a non-cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial results.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.

 M & A - Other   Highlight
Events or changes in circumstances that could result in an impairment review include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, and significant negative industry or economic trends.
