Hi,

kde-misc/synaptiks compiles fine in anycase, but at runtime needs the x11-drivers/xf86-input-synaptics driver loaded. Isn't that what RDEPEND was made for?

I'm not sure about the requirements with hal, maybe one has to force x11-drivers/xf86-input-synaptics[hal] and even x11-base/xorg-server[hal].

Cheers,
Nico

Reproducible: Always

You have misconfigured /etc/make.conf if synaptics is missing from INPUT_DEVICES="" and xf86-input-synaptics is not installed. 
I left the RDEPEND out in purpose because even if you pull in the depend, there's no way to force you to setup your X.org at runtime to load the drivers.
In other words, it's up to the user to install and load the drivers he needs.

That said, I don't maintain the package anymore, so moving to maintainers ->
