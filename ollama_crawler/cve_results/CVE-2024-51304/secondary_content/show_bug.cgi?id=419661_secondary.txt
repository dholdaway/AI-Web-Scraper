If I open the popup menu by right clicking on the text field where I enter my messages and choose "Languages/de_CH_frami", it will always be set to "de_AT_frami". Choosing one of the different English variants work though.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Choose de_CH_frami for the language of the spell checker in the popup menu
2. Open the popup menu again and check which language is selected
Actual Results:  
de_AT_frami is selected.

Expected Results:  
de_CH_frami is selected.

Version of installed packages that might be relevant:

net-im/pidgin-2.10.4 (but happened with earlier versions, too)
app-text/hunspell-1.3.2-r3
app-text/gtkspell-2.0.16
app-text/hunspell-1.3.2-r3
app-text/aspell-0.60.6.1

There is a new version of myspell-de: app-dicts/myspell-de-r1

I'm pretty sure that it will solve the problem. Can you install this package and retry, please? 

Notes: 
1) the package is still keyworded - you have to add this package to
/etc/portage/package.keywords.

2) The filenames of the German dictionaries were changed (which is the solution of the problem). You may have to re-select the language if you start your program for the first time to Languages/de_CH or whatever you use

I have to select the dictionary twice, but it finally works after all the time. :)
