with another solid quarter and I am very pleased with our 20 percent net revenue growth for 2023. Looking at 2024 and beyond, I could not be more excited to continue our mission seeking to improve foot and ankle patient outcomes. said

 Inside Paragon 28, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
A significant decrease in demand or development of products could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory on hand, which could lead to additional charges for excess and obsolete inventory.



 Other - Other   Highlight
As a result, our prior year financial statements and interim financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements.

 Other - Other   Highlight
These factors subject us to the risk of obsolescence and expiration, which may lead to impairment charges.

 Financial - Dividend   Highlight
The Company estimates the fair value of each stock-option award containing service and/or performance conditions on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option valuation model which incorporates assumptions as to stock price volatility, the expected life of the options, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Commissions to sales agents for the sales exceeding their quotas are classified as incremental costs of obtaining a contract as such costs would not have been incurred if the contract was not signed.
