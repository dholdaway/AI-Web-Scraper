The ebuilds for versions 10 and 11 contain an OpenRC init script (and a corresponding config):

[wschlich@zephyr(pts/11):~]$ qlist -Ive teamviewer
net-misc/teamviewer-11.0.53191
[wschlich@zephyr(pts/11):~]$ qlist -e teamviewer | fgrep .d/
/etc/conf.d/teamviewerd11
/etc/init.d/teamviewerd11
[wschlich@zephyr(pts/11):~]$ 

If it doesn't work for you, feel free to reopen or create a new bug :)
