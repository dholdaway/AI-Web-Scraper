Our fourth quarter results exceeded guidance across all key operating metrics, fueled in part by a record number of 7-figure deals closed in the quarter,” said Rick McConnell, Chief Executive Officer. “We continue to see a growing number of companies looking to consolidate often ineffective and costly monitoring tools into a unified observability platform. We believe that our contextual analytics, AI leadership, and automation differentiate us in the market and empower us to capture this opportunity.”Dynatrace also announced today that its Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program for up to $500 million of common stock. “The share repurchase program demonstrates our confidence in the business and conviction in our future growth prospects,” said Jim Benson, Chief Financial Officer. “While investing in the business is our foremost priority, this program allows us to leverage our strong balance sheet and cash flow opportunistically to drive shareholder return while also allowing us the flexibility to consider strategic acquisitions to accelerate growth and deliver business value for our customers.”All growth rates are compared to the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2023 unless otherwise noted.Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Financial Highlights:•Total ARR of $1,504 million, an increase of 21%, or 20% on a constant currency basis •Total Revenue of $381 million, an increase of 21%, or 21% on a constant currency basis•Subscription Revenue of $360 million, an increase of 23%, or 22% on a constant currency basis•GAAP Income from Operations of $23 million and Non-GAAP Income from Operations of $95 million •GAAP EPS of $0.13 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.30, on a dilutive basisFull Year Fiscal 2024 Financial Highlights:•Total Revenue of $1,431 million, an increase of 23%, or 22% on a constant currency basis•Subscription Revenue of $1,359 million, an increase of 25%, or 24% on a constant currency basis•GAAP Income from Operations of $128 million and Non-GAAP Income from Operations of $398 million •GAAP EPS of $0.52 and non-GAAP EPS of $1.20, on a dilutive basis•GAAP Operating Cash Flow of $378 million and Free Cash Flow of $346 millionBusiness Highlights:•Go-to-market traction: We closed a record 18 deals greater than $1 million in annual contract value (ACV) in the quarter. Fifteen of these deals were in collaboration with partners, including our first-ever 9-figure total contract value (TCV) deal, which was an expansion deal closed in conjunction with Accenture. We also closed our largest new logo win, a nearly 8-figure ACV deal. •Industry recognition: We were named a Leader in the 2024 GigaOm Radar Report for Cloud Observability Solutions, positioned as the vendor closest to the center of the radar, reflecting Dynatrace's industry-leading innovation and ability to deliver the highest impact for customers. 1The following information was filed by Dynatrace, Inc.
