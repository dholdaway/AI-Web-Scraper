Sometimes would be interesting being able to skip build of a package, for example, when I run:
# emerge -avuDN world

sometimes I have to update packages like "mozilla-firefox" that needs some time for building and merging and I need to turn off my machine soon. I think that would be great being able to run something like:
# emerge -avuDN world --skip www-client/mozilla-firefox

for letting portage update smaller packages and leave firefox for merging in the future (when I have more time)

Thanks a lot

Reproducible: Always

See `man portage` for /etc/portage/package.mask usage information.

echo ">www-client/mozilla-firefox-2.0.0.11" >> /etc/portage/package.mask

But I would prefer only skip it temporally, but, from other point of view I understand that package.mask can also be used for this purpose, then, OK, thanks and sorry for the inconvenience
