how do you handle multiple configurations of a service?
do you ever had the need of start/restart a service with more than one
configuration?

i had it (see the url for the practical example)

do you think it is a good solution? maybe there can be a better one?

you could create a link in /etc/init.d/ as timidity-jack to timidity and then
just copy the /etc/conf.d/ file from timidity to timidity-jack

run /etc/init.d/timidity to use alsa and /etc/init.d/timidity-jack to use jack

either way i dont see a need right now for this kind of additional complexity on
a global init scale
