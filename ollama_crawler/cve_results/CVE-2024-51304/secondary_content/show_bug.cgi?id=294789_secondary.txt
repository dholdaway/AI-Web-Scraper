seems like the program disconnects the touchpad on boot and doesn't reconnects it thus making it extremely hard to work without the pad. on previous version it happened too but the touchpad would have reconnected again after a few sec.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. upgrade to 0.2.0
2. reboot computer.
3.

Actual Results:  
touchpad stays disconnected, one needs to work with the keyboards.

Expected Results:  
touchpad should be working.

I suggest you report this to the upstream, in the kde-apps.org $HOMEPAGE for instance.

I have absolutely no clue, what "disconnects the touchpad" is supposed to mean.  synaptiks doesn't "connect" the touchpad, it simply uses the XInput API to access the device properties provided by xf86-input-synaptics.  

Please check the Xorg log to make sure, that the synaptics driver is successfully loaded and verify the output of "synclient -l".  If these are ok, please enable debug output for KDebug ("kdebugdialog --on 0"), start synaptiks from a terminal and post its output.

Don't forget to disable debug output again, otherwise synaptiks will be very chatty.

PS:  It this turns out to be a synaptiks problem, please open a new issue in the upstream bugtracker at http://bitbucket.org/lunar/synaptiks/issues

Thanks.

Synaptiks 0.2.1 is now in Portage, and upstream replied:

An other explanation is of course, that the reporter accidentally simply 
misunderstood, how synaptiks switches the touchpad on or off.   He might have 
misinterpreted the red cross on the tray icon (which indicates, that the 
touchpad is switched off) as "disconnected touchpad".

In this case however, the touchpad was either disabled before synaptiks start 
or he explicitly disabled the touchpad (directly or indirectly by turning on 
any of the automatic management features).  synaptiks doesn't disable the 
touchpad first-hand.

Easy.  It was only assumed, that you *accidentally* misunderstood, how synaptiks works.  It's not far-fetched assumption, especially since you didn't respond to questions in this bug, and didn't report anything to the upstream issue tracker.  But no one said, that you were "stupid".

I'm going thought out a rough time lately, I've forgot about the issue, I'm using the kcm module currently
