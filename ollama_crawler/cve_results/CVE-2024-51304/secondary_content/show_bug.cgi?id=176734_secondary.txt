There is a set of patches with useful improvements for KDE's Xinerama support. The patches have been in since :
*kdelibs-3.5.5-r7 (24 Nov 2006)

  24 Nov 2006; Diego Pettenò <flameeyes@gentoo.org>
  +files/kdelibs-3.5.5-seli-xinerama.patch, +kdelibs-3.5.5-r7.ebuild:
  Add a patch to improve xinerama support, by Lubos Lunak.

*kwin-3.5.5-r2 (24 Nov 2006)

  24 Nov 2006; Diego Pettenò <flameeyes@gentoo.org> +kwin-3.5.5-r2.ebuild:
  Add a patch to improve xinerama support, by Lubos Lunak.

*kdesktop-3.5.5-r1 (24 Nov 2006)

  24 Nov 2006; Diego Pettenò <flameeyes@gentoo.org>
  +files/kdesktop-3.5.5-seli-xinerama.patch, +kdesktop-3.5.5-r1.ebuild:
  Add a patch to improve xinerama support, by Lubos Lunak.

*qt-3.3.8 (22 Feb 2007)

  22 Feb 2007; Caleb Tennis <caleb@gentoo.org>
  +files/qt-3.3.8-seli-xinerama.patch, ...

The patches get applied during build, but new keyboard shortcuts do not show up in KControl. In addition, Desktop->Window Behavior->Separate screen focus checkbox works backwards (need to uncheck to activate separate screen focus).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.emerge latest masked KDE 3.5 or 3.6 and latest qt3


Actual Results:  
1.there is no way to set shortcuts for new actions (window to screen 0, 1, etc. and others)
2.'separate screen focus' must be unchecked for task switcher popup to show only windows from current screen

Expected Results:  
Shortcuts should be there

See http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-538021.html
Alrua in the forums has found a workaround: quit kde, edit kdeglobals file and add shortcuts manually. Then start kde and they will function.

Is this still a problem in KDE 3.5.8? I can't seem to reproduce it.

No response and works for me.

The xinerama patch is not applied in kde 3.5.8, although it is possible to do so manually with a few changes to the 3.5.7 .patch-file.

Since the bug is not applied in 3.5.8, i suppose you could say that this bug is not relevant, but in that case the lag of the xinerama patch is a bug in its own right.

When the patch is applied the configuration options are still missing as per this bug.

(KDE 3.5.8 AMD64)
