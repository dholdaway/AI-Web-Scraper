Description


Paweł Hajdan, Jr. (RETIRED)






          2006-07-31 12:49:13 UTC
        

Code Listing 5.4: Compiling and installing the new kernel
# make && make modules_install
# mount /boot
# cp arch/i386/boot/bzImage /boot/bzImage-2.6.9-gentoo-r2 <---- this line

IMO replacing marked line above with "make install" would result in much cleaner and simpler upgrade procedure. It creates convenient symlinks in /boot, copies config and System.map files and automatically labels them with kernel version string.

There's no need to copy the System.map (kernel folks say so) or .config (can be taken from /proc). And doing something "by hand" is always much cleaner and simplier than using a script for that. Thanks for reporting anyway.
