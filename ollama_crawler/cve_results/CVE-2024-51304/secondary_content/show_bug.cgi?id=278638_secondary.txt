When emerging GDM, there are numerous parser warnings and errors in http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.1.2/dbhierx.mod that causes the emerge process to fail with a final "unable to parse ko/gdm.xml"

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge gdm

Do you have app-text/docbook-xml-dtd-4.1.2 emerged?  If not, does emerging that fix it?  If so, does re-emerging that fix it?

It emerged when I tried some day later, so I can't reproduce it. I'm not sure exactly what made it work, but I know that I rebooted and run python-updater.

python-updater shouldn't change result of gdm build, so I'll close this worksforme
