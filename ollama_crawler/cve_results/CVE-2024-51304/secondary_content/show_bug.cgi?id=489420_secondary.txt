Hi, I've started to experience a mouse problem after upgrading qemu to the latest version. The keyboard was working, but it was very difficult to move a mouse pointer.

After some searching, I found the solution:
http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-7423718.html

The solution was to run:
 paxctl-ng -m /usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 

You might want to investigate and fix it properly in the ebuild

I found a better way fixing it, it's in RH faq:
