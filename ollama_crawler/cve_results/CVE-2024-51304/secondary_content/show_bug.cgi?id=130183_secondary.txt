I use wi-fi very seldom, so I only load ipw2200 kernel module when I want it.
After a total system update (~x86, incl. udev-089-r2), ipw2200 and some other modules (ethernet over ieee1394, which I don't want to auto-load, either) started to auto-load early in the boot sequence (apparently, when udev is started).
This way, my ethernet card module loads later, and my eth card is now eth1 instead of eth0. This totally sucks, and I don't want ipw2200 and all firewire modules loaded automatically. How to avoid this?

Either blacklist the modules, or use RC_COLDLUG="net.eth0 !net.*" or something like that with latest baselayout.

Tried RC_COLDPLUG=... now. Did almost nothing. All these modules get loaded
after the "Letting udev process events" message. However, ethernet card is eth0 again (maybe it's just incidentally). Nevertheless, I really don't need eth1394, ipw2200, yenta_socket (and other pcmcia modules which I compiled just in case, but don't actually use as of now). Is there a way to disable this auto-load-lots-of-modules? I liked the way it was before, /etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.6 has everything I need.
Btw, tried RC_COLDPLUG="no", no use.
As for blacklisting, it's very un-user-friendly to blacklist individual modules. I have everything I need in modules.autoload.d.

Well, may be unfriendly but it won't change. Udev has it's own coldplug functionality now, if you don't want to modules loaded, then blacklist them.

Understood. Can you tell me where can I read about blacklisting (i.e., how do I blacklist certain modules)?

Just put the unwanted modules into /etc/hotplug/blacklist ;)

dammit... upgraded to udev 090, baselayout 1.12.0_pre17-r3,
now blacklist doesn't work at all - shit happens as before i blacklisted unwanted modules earlier

Please, file a new bug about udev...
