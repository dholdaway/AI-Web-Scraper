 Inside Qualys, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Revenue - Product   Highlight
The uncertainty surrounding macroeconomic factors in the U.S. and globally characterized by the supply chain environment, inflationary pressure, rising interest rates, financial institution failures and associated uncertainty, labor shortages, significant volatility of global markets, reduced spending and extended sales cycles, and geopolitical conflicts could have a material adverse effect on our long-term business and could lead to further economic disruption and expose us to greater risk as our current and potential customers may reduce or eliminate their overall spending on IT security.



 Legal - Other   Highlight
The assessment of tax effects of our uncertain tax positions in our financial statements involves significant judgment in interpreting complex and ambiguous tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices, determining the probability of various possible settlement outcomes, evaluating the litigation process based on tax authority behaviors in similar cases, and estimating the likelihood that another taxing authority could review the respective tax position.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
As of December 31, 2023, valuation allowances remain in certain jurisdictions where we believe it is necessary to see further positive evidence, such as sustained achievement of sufficient profits to meet a more likely than not stance that the valuation allowance should be reversed.

 Other - Other   Highlight
However, as accounting estimates are subject to inherent uncertainty, our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision that could be material in the future.
