Xterm fails to run after migrating to modular X 7. I re-emerged it and it works now. I also ran revdep-rebuild and it didn't find that there was problem with it. at the very least revdep-rebuild should find that it needs to be rebuilt.

revdep-rebuild finds it just fine here... No real information to diagnose the issue provided, closing WORKSFORME.
