Description

          2008-04-02 07:21:46 UTC
        

Weird ACPI exception (Processor not present) while booting with LiveCD 2008.0 beta on an Athlon AMD64 system (haven't tried x86 yet).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:




My system has only one AMD64 CPU, which is not hot-pluggable.

this is just a warning, however fixed with upcoming 2.6.25 kernel. not gentoo specific.

Does it mean Gentoo 2008.0 could be based on 2.6.25? (currently it's 2.6.23-something.)

We're not upgrading the kernel just to make a harmless warning go away.

I have seen this sort of warning relate to the BIOS not having enumerated the frequency/power scaling functions of the processor correctly.  Could the original finder of this issue see if their mainboard's manufacturer has a newer  BIOS firmware avaible and test with that.

I will check that today evening and report any information.

I've upgraded my BIOS and the problem went away: Processor #0 detected. I'm closing the bug then. Thanks a lot for the suggestion.

FYI: I have an ASUS A8V-E SE. I upgraded my BIOS from version 1002 to 1010.
