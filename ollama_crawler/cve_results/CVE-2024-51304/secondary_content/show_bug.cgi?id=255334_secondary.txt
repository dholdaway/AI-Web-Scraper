/etc/init.d/deluged fails to properly detect DELUGED_USER's homedir

I don't know if it's really a bug, I've just discovered it in my deluged bughunt.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create users like 'foo' and 'foo-lol'
2. Set DELUGED_USER to 'foo' in /etc/conf.d/deluged and DELUGED_OPTS to '--logfile=/var/log/deluged --config=/opt/home/foo/.config/deluge/ --loglevel=debug'
3. /etc/init.d/deluged start


Actual Results:  
$ ps ax|grep deluged
16474 ?        Ssl    0:06 /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/deluged /home/foo-lol --do-not-daemonize --logfile=/var/log/deluged --config=/opt/home/foo/.config/deluge/ --loglevel=debug


Expected Results:  
/usr/bin/python /usr/bin/deluged /home/foo --do-not-daemonize --logfile=/var/log/deluged --config=/opt/home/foo/.config/deluge/ --loglevel=debug

ps aux | grep deluged
foo      17134  1.6  1.2  61376 13192 ?        Ssl  12:04   0:00 /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/deluged --do-not-daemonize --logfile=/var/log/deluged --config=//home/foo/.config/deluge/ --loglevel=debug

In my case it doesn't set the homedir...

Oh, looks like I forgot about etc-update: now I have init.d/deluged dated 2009/01/15 and the same results.
