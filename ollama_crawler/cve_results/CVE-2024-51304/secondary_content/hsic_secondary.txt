-1- more   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE HENRY SCHEIN REPORTS FOURTH-QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS AND INTRODUCES 2024 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE  ●Fourth quarter GAAP diluted EPS of $0.13. ●Solid fourth quarter financial results in line with the Company’s guidance provided on November 13, 2023. ●Fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.66, reflects: ●$0.05 of acquisition-related expenses and adjustments, and ●an estimated $0.70 to $0.75 from the cybersecurity incident. ●Introduces guidance for full-year 2024 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.00 to $5.16, reflecting growth of 11% to 15% compared with 2023, and full-year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA growth of more than 15%.MELVILLE, N.Y., February 27, 2024 – Henry Schein, Inc. (Nasdaq: HSIC), the world’s largest provider of health care solutions to office-based dental and medical practitioners, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 30, 2023. “We are pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2023, which was in line with our expectations and reflects a solid recovery from last year’s cybersecurity incident,” said Stanley M. Bergman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein.“Our fourth quarter financial results included strong growth in our Technology and Value-Added Services businesses, and in global sales of implants and biomaterials largely driven by acquisitions, and were negatively impacted by higher-than-usual acquisition-related expenses and adjustments,” Mr. Bergman said.“The 2024 guidance we are introducing today reflects our continued confidence in the stability of the underlying markets we serve, our recovery efforts from the cybersecurity incident, and the execution of our Strategic Plan. For 2024, while we expect to have some short-term residual impact on merchandise sales from the incident, we believe we will continue to strengthen our leading market position. We are also introducing Adjusted EBITDA guidance as we believe this provides investors with an additional metric that reflects the performance of the business as we pivot to higher-growth, higher-margin products and services.” Mr. Bergman added, “We believe we are well positioned to grow the business in line with our financial goals of high-single-digit to low-double-digit operating income and earnings per share by continuing to execute on our BOLD+1 Strategic Plan.”  



 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-2- more 1Fourth-Quarter 2023 Financial Results ●Total net sales for the quarter were $3.0 billion, a decrease of 10.5% compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. This reflects an internal sales decrease of 12.0%, calculated at constant foreign exchange rates, excluding sales from acquisitions, and adjusting for the extra week in 2022. ●Total net sales reflect an estimated reduction of $350 million to $400 million, or 10% to 12%, due to the cybersecurity incident. ●Fourth-quarter sales and internal sales growth are summarized below and included in detail as Exhibit A1.

Internal sales growth is calculated from total net sales using constant foreign exchange rates, excluding sales for acquisitions, and adjusting for the extra week in 2022. 2 See Exhibit B for a reconciliation of GAAP net income and diluted EPS to non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS. 3 See Exhibit C for Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter and full-year 2023. The Company will calculate full-year  2024 Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner. 4 See Exhibit D for details of acquisition expense and acquisition-related adjustments included in GAAP and non-GAAP  net income. 5Reference to diluted EPS refers to diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. 



 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-3- more Full-Year 2023 Financial Results●Total net sales for 2023 were $12.3 billion, a decrease of 2.4% compared with 2022. This reflects an internal sales decrease of 4.4%, calculated at constant foreign exchange rates, excluding sales from acquisitions, and adjusting for the extra week in 2022. The Company’s 2023 sales and internal sales growth are summarized below and included in detail as Exhibit A1. Sales ($ Billion)Internal Growth/(Decrease)1(%) Global Dental $7.5 (1.4%)  Merchandise $5.8 (1.6%)  Equipment $1.7 (0.9%) Global Medical$4.0 (11.2%) Global Technology and Value -Added Services $0.8 7.2% TOTAL SALES$12.3 (4.4%) ●GAAP net income2 for 2023 was $416 million, or $3.16 per diluted share5, which includes acquisition expenses and acquisition-related adjustments4 of $0.09 per diluted share. 2022 GAAP net income was $538 million, or $3.91 per diluted share, which includes net favorable acquisition expenses and acquisition-related adjustments4 of $0.02 per diluted share. ●Non-GAAP net income2 for 2023 was $593 million, or $4.50 per diluted share5, which includes acquisition expenses and acquisition-related adjustments4 of $0.09 per diluted share. 2022 non-GAAP net income was $741 million, or $5.38 per diluted share, which includes net favorable acquisition expenses and acquisition-related adjustments4 of $0.02 per diluted share. The Company’s reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income is summarized in detail as Exhibit B. ●GAAP and non-GAAP net income are negatively impacted by an estimated $0.70 to $0.75 per diluted share, attributable to the business interruption impact and recovery from the cybersecurity incident. Capital Deployment To accelerate the implementation of its 2022-2024 BOLD+1 Strategic Plan, the Company invested $287 million in highly complementary business acquisitions during the fourth quarter of 2023 and $955 million for the full year. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company repurchased approximately 692,000 shares of its common stock at an average price of $72.32 per share, for a total of $50 million. The impact of the repurchase of shares on fourth-quarter diluted EPS was immaterial. 



 
 
 
 
 
-4- more For the full year of 2023, the Company repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $77.80 per share, for a total of $250 million. The impact of the repurchase of shares on the full year diluted EPS was also immaterial. At year-end, Henry Schein had approximately $265 million authorized and available for future stock repurchases. 2024 Financial Guidance Henry Schein today introduced financial guidance for 2024. Guidance is for current continuing operations as well as announced acquisitions and does not include the impact of future share repurchases, potential future acquisitions, restructuring and integration expenses, amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, certain expenses directly associated with the cybersecurity incident or any potential insurance claim recovery. This guidance also assumes that foreign currency exchange rates remain generally consistent with current levels and that end markets remain consistent with current market conditions: ●2024 non-GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. is expected to be $5.00 to $5.16, reflecting growth of 11% to 15% compared with 2023 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.50. This guidance reflects: ●an estimated residual impact of the cybersecurity incident of approximately $0.15 per diluted share, which will primarily impact the first quarter, and ●an estimated increase in the non-GAAP effective tax rate from 23% to 25%, or approximately $0.13 per diluted share. ●2024 sales growth is expected to be approximately 8% to 12% over 2023, and reflects the expected merchandise sales recovery subsequent to the cybersecurity incident, and sales from the acquisitions completed in 2023. ●2024 Adjusted EBITDA3 is expected to increase by more than 15%.Adjustments to 2024 GAAP Net Income and Diluted EPSThe Company is providing guidance for 2024 diluted EPS on a non-GAAP basis and for Adjusted EBITDA, as noted above. The Company is not providing a reconciliation of its 2024 non-GAAP guidance to its projected 2024 diluted EPS prepared on a GAAP basis, or its projected 2024 Adjusted EBITDA to net income prepared on a GAAP basis. This is because the Company is unable to provide without unreasonable effort an estimate of integration and restructuring costs related to an ongoing initiative to drive operating efficiencies and certain expenses directly associated with the cybersecurity incident, including the corresponding tax effect, that will be included in the Company’s 2024 diluted EPS and net income prepared on a GAAP basis. The inability to provide this reconciliation is due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty of predicting the occurrence, magnitude, financial impact and timing of related costs. Management does not believe these items are representative of the Company’s underlying business performance. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results.

These statements include EPS and Adjusted EBITDA guidance and are generally identified by the use of such terms as “may,” “could,” “expect,” “intend,” “believe,” “plan,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “project,” “anticipate,” “to be,” “to make” or other comparable terms. A fuller discussion of our operations, financial condition and status of litigation matters, including factors that may affect our business and future prospects, is contained in documents we have filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and will be contained in all subsequent periodic filings we make with the SEC. These documents identify in detail important risk factors that could cause our actual perform ance to differ materially from current expectations. Risk factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current and historical results include, but are not limited to: our dependence on third parties for the manufacture and supply of our products; our ability to develop or acquire and maintain and protect new products (particularly technology products) and technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins; transitional challenges associated with acquisitions, dispositions and joint ventures, including the failure to achieve anticipated synergies/benefits, as well as significant demands on our operations, information systems, legal, regulatory, compliance, financial and human resources functions in connection with acquisitions, dispositions and joint ventures; certain provisions in our governing documents that may discourage third-party acquisitions of us; adverse changes in supplier rebates or other purchasing incentives; risks related to the sale of corporate brand products; security risks associated with our information systems and technology products and services, such as 



 
 
 
 
 
 
-6- more cyberattacks or other privacy or data security breaches (including the October 2023 incident); effects of a highly competitive (including, without limitation, competition from third-party online commerce sites) and consolidating market; changes in the health care industry; risks from expansion of customer purchasing power and multi-tiered costing structures; increases in shipping costs for our products or other service issues with our third-party shippers; general global and domestic macro-economic and political conditions, including inflation, deflation, recession, ongoing wars, fluctuations in energy pricing and the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, and changes to other economic indicators, international trade agreements, potential trade barriers and terrorism; geopolitical wars; failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements; risks associated with the EU Medical Device Regulation; failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud or other laws and regulations; failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to the collection, storage and processing of sensitive personal information or standards in electronic health records or transmissions; changes in tax legislation; risks related to product liability, intellectual property and other claims; risks associated with customs policies or legislative import restrictions; risks associated with disease outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), or similar wide-spread public health concerns and other natural or man-made disasters; risks associated with our global operations; litigation risks; new or unanticipated litigation developments and the status of litigation matters; our dependence on our senior management, employee hiring and retention, and our relationships with customers, suppliers and manufacturers; and disruptions in financial markets. The order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority. We caution that these factors may not be exhaustive and that many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Accordingly, any forward-looking statements contained herein should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. We undertake no duty and have no obligation to update forward-looking statements except as required by law.  Included within the press release are non-GAAP financial measures that supplement the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income prepared under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures adjust the Company’s actual results prepared under GAAP to exclude certain items. In the schedules attached to the press release, the non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to and should be considered together with the Consolidated Statements of Income. Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business. The impact of certain items that are excluded include integration and restructuring costs, and amortization of acquisition -related assets, because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions we consummate and occur on an unpredictable basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding, similarly captioned, GAAP measures.
