Description

When I run gaim, it segfaults. It was happening immediately upon drawing the buddy list window after logging in with the AIM protocol (did not segfault after signing in with MSN). I emerged gdb, and afterward (much to my surprise), it started segfaulting in a different place.

It now segfaults when a conversation window is opened.

The output from gaim -d is in the file gaim-debug.
The output from gdb gaim core is in the file gdb.
The output from emerge --info is in info.

Let me know if you need more information.

I remerged gaim with USE="-spell" emerge gaim. It no longer segfaults. I decided to try unmasking and merging aspell-0.60.2. I then remerged gaim with USE="spell". Now everything plays nicely together - no more segfaults. 

I don't know if others using aspell-0.50.5-r4 are having the same problem. I also don't know why the newer aspell was masked.

Can you confirm that downgrading aspell (and then rebuilding enchant and gtkspell and gaim) can produce the error again?

I downgraded aspell, remerged the mentioned packages, and rebuilt gaim. The crash no longer occurs.

I'm going to chalk this up to one of those library-change snafus.  I would occasionally run revdep-rebuild.
