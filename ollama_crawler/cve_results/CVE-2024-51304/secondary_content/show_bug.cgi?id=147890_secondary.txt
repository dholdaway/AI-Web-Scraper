You have outdated eclasses in your overlay.

If this is not a package error then what is it?  Removing and adding back the vmware overlay doesn't help.  emerge --sync doesn't help.  Waiting doesn't help and certainly "You have outdated eclasses in your overlay" doesn't help.

It probably means you have a local overlay with outdated eclass.  I kept my /usr/local/portage minimal and updated the rest of my overlay using layman or gensync.
