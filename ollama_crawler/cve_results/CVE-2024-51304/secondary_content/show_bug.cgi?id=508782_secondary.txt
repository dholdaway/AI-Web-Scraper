I'm wondering b/c at an ~x86 this packages was put into @preserved-libs too :


tfoerste@n22 ~ $ sudo ~/workspace/bin/chr_uml.sh -c 'eix-update -q && emerge --update @world --deep --newuse --changed-use --with-bdeps=y' -r ~/virtual/uml/n22unst4         

These are the packages that would be merged, in reverse order:

Calculating dependencies  ...... done!
[nomerge       ] mail-mta/courier-0.71 
[ebuild     U  ]  net-libs/courier-authlib-0.66.1 [0.65.0-r3]

I'm not sure I can follow this report.

These libs seem to be internal and courier-authlib links to them itself, so there should be no preserved-rebuild issue. Can you give me instructions how to reproduce this, what you'd expect to happen and what does happen?

Is this still relevant with the current version?

Well, 5 years later - the affected system and its hardware is gone.

probably I was wondering why at that time net-libs/courier-authlib was rebuild after it was updated.

But again, I'll close this, or?
