In recent discussion in -dev, apparently platform herds prefer bugs instead of contacting them directly when a package needs (~)arch.

(log considered neutral)

deathwing00 I need 2 packages marked ~arch in your architectures after being tested
ferdy which ones ?
metalgod open a bug please :P
JoseJX File bugs please!
deathwing00 media-gfx/kphotoalbum and kde-misc/koppermine
deathwing00 JoseJX: ain't it better to poke you directly?
ferdy mmmm kde stuff... file a bug, we'll get to it somewhen :P
JoseJX deathwing00: No, not really.
KingTaco best to file a bug
ferdy no, we normally prefer bugs

why did you lock the bug ?  makes no sense to have it closed

otherwise, what part of the documentation are you referring to ?  pretty much everywhere it refers to filing a bug

The following one:

In any case, it would be nice to have it in there explicitly :)

those are arch specific policies

the general policies are in the section before that
