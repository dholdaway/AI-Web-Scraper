(NYSE:TRN) today announced earnings results for the fourth quarter and year end ended December 31, 2023.Financial and Operational Highlights – Fourth Quarter•Quarterly total company revenues of $798 million; 35% improvement year over year •Quarterly income from continuing operations per common diluted share ("EPS") of $0.81 and quarterly adjusted EPS of $0.82◦Results include tax benefits related to state apportionment and tax law changes•Lease fleet utilization of 97.5% and FLRD of positive 23.7% at quarter-end•Quarterly railcar deliveries of 4,000 and new railcar orders of 840Financial and Operational Highlights – Full Year•Full year total company revenues of $3.0 billion •Full year reported EPS of $1.43 and adjusted EPS of $1.38•Full year cash flow from continuing operations and adjusted free cash flow after investments and dividends ("Adjusted Free Cash Flow") were $309 million and $29 million, respectively•Full year railcar deliveries of 17,355 and new railcar orders of 11,5002024 Guidance•Industry deliveries of approximately 40,000 railcars•Net investment in the lease fleet of $300 million to $400 million•Manufacturing capital expenditures of $50 million to $60 million•EPS of $1.30 to $1.50◦Excludes items outside of our core business operationsManagement Commentary “Trinity Industries ended the year with revenue up 51% over 2022, a backlog of $3.2 billion, and adjusted EPS of $1.38, up 47% year over year,” stated Trinity’s Chief Executive Officer and President, Jean Savage.“In our Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group, we maintained an impressive Future Lease Rate Differential through the year, and rising lease rates drove our revenue up 13% over 2022. Fleet utilization remains favorable at 97.5%." Ms. Savage continued, “The Rail Products Group faced challenges in the fourth quarter with the border closure and related congestion impacting deliveries and margins in the segment. Despite unexpected headwinds through the year, this segment reported operating profit up 119% over 2022.”“In 2024, we expect to see continued improvement in our business. We are introducing 2024 EPS annual guidance of $1.30 to $1.50, which reflects improving margins in both our segments. This is offset by significantly lower planned railcar sales, higher elimination of profit from intercompany railcar sales, and a normalized tax provision as compared to 2023.” Ms. Savage concluded, “We view ourselves as a leasing company that is enabled by our manufacturing and services businesses. As a result, we are re-aligning our segments starting in 2024 and moving our maintenance business into the Railcar Leasing & Services segment. This allows us to better leverage our maintenance capabilities to support lease fleet optimization and growth in our services business.”1The following information was filed by Trinity Industries Inc (TRN) on Thursday, February 22, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.

 Inside Trinity Industries Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Revenue - Product   Highlight
We evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers and monitor performance of relevant market sectors; however, weaknesses in any of these market sectors could affect the financial viability of our customers, which could negatively impact our revenues, credit loss expense, and operating profits.



 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
If actual results are not consistent with management's estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimated future cash flows, we could be exposed to impairment losses that may be material.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
If such changes take place, there is a risk that our effective tax rate could increase or decrease in any period, impacting our net earnings.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Further, the cost and volume of lease fleet maintenance and compliance events have increased, and we expect elevated levels of these activities to continue in the near term.

 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
Although lease rates and lease fleet utilization remain strong, weaknesses in certain sectors of the North American and global economy may make it more difficult to sell or lease certain types of railcars.
