Hi!

gv lost track of files. I think keeping track is a good thing so this should be fixed. 

qpkg -f /usr/bin/gv returns nothing.

/usr/bin/gv
/usr/lib/X11/gv
/usr/lib/X11/gv/gv_class.ad
/usr/lib/X11/gv/gv_system.ad
/usr/lib/X11/gv/gv_user.ad

Thanks

Sebastian

Sebastian, it works fine here. Have a look at /var/db/pkg/$CATEGORY/$EBUILD, your package db seems to be broken.

remerge gv and that should fix it.  There's no telling what happened from the information you've provided.
