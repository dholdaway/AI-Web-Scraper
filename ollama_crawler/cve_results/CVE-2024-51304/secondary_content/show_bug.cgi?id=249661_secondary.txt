Description

          2008-12-02 22:21:37 UTC
        

Emerging x11-drivers/xf86-input-synaptics fails on make at line 590 of synaptics.c.  Error output appears in attachment.  Problem might be solved by changing lines 589-591 as follows:

#if GET_ABI_MAJOR(ABI_XINPUT_VERSION) == 0
    pointer opts = local->options; //add this line
    local->history_size = xf86SetIntOption(opts, "HistorySize", 0);
#endif

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.emerge -uD xf86-input-synaptics

0.99.2 has a few small bugfixes. Would you mind seeing whether it clears this up please?
