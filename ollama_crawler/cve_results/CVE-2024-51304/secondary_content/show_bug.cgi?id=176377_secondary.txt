For the past several versions of lighttpd, I have noticed that /etc/init.d/lighttpd stop does not actually kill the server processes.  It seems to be related to the use of the fast-cgi configuration options being used, since non-fcgi machines likely do not experience this problem.

The init script reports [OK] when it fails to stop the processes.  The problem can be worked around with killall lighttpd.

It is also probably related to the design of lighttpd, it probably has a controlling process that lies about the status of its startup and shutdown and simply reports OK when it daemonizes or dies (not sure).

This bug also implies that init.d/lighttpd's restart function also would fail.

I suppose a possible solution might be similar to one suggested in this bug:

Reproducible: Always

i can't reproduce the problem, so probably i am doing something wrong. can you please reiterate the exact steps that exhibit the bug?

are you running fastcgi applications using spawn-fcgi? if so, could i perhaps get you to try the spawn-fcgi scripts provided at bug #149467.
thanks

The problem seems to have gone away in newer versions of lighttpd.  I think someone just changed the init script.
