Description

the /etc/conf.d/samba contains lots of "config options" which should be set to things like: "start-stop-daemon --stop --quiet --pidfile /var/run/samba/smbd.pid" and "unset TMP TMPDIR"

IMHO, that is not a config option. Its script internals.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. give a non-rocket scientist the task to configure samba
2. point him/her to /etc/conf.d/samba
3. run...

Actual Results:  
User screams loud.

Expected Results:  
Users should be satisfied and comment during lunch break how cool Gentoo is.

conf.d should only contain config options, not half the init.d script.

Seriously, the guy here found out he would rather rewrite the init.d script than patch it (he tried to make it run with busybox ash instead of ash)

Why not use /etc/init.d/{smbd,nmbd,winbind} scripts? Then will the user have the power to start/reload/stop serivces independently of each other.

You know, user config is in /etc/samba/smb.conf; so move there and leave 
/etc/conf.d/samba alone unless you have special needs.
