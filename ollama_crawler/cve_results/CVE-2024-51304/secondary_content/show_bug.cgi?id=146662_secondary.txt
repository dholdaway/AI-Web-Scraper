mp3blaster does not paint borders. For making it painting them is necessary to change main.cc, adding an include (#include <locale.h>), and then, the first line of int main() can be "setlocale(LC_ALL, "");", this way mp3blaster will be shown as expected.

This can be reproducible by using a system-wide UTF-8 system, with 02locale as follows:

LC_ALL="es_ES.UTF-8"
LANGUAGE="es_ES.UTF-8"
LANG="es_ES.UTF-8"

Here there is no X installed, so mp3blaster is running in console (ttyX). Lines won't be drawn if USE="unicode" was marked when ncurses were emerged (compiled).

Sorry for the first lack of information.

What happens to filenames with UTF-8 chars in them with this patch?

Looks and works fine here with fi_FI.utf8. Your consolefont is likely wrong.
