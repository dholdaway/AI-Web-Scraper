dev-python/pycrypto-2.0.1-r6 is not enough for dev-python/paramiko-1.7.6:

>>> import paramiko
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/paramiko/__init__.py", line 69, in <module>
    from transport import randpool, SecurityOptions, Transport
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/paramiko/transport.py", line 32, in <module>
    from paramiko import util
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/paramiko/util.py", line 32, in <module>
    from paramiko.common import *
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/paramiko/common.py", line 98, in <module>
    from rng import StrongLockingRandomPool
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/paramiko/rng.py", line 23, in <module>
    from Crypto.Util.randpool import RandomPool as _RandomPool
ImportError: No module named Crypto.Util.randpool

Updating pycrypto to dev-python/pycrypto-2.1.0_beta1 fixes the issue (albeit with a warning):

>>> import paramiko
/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/Crypto/Util/randpool.py:40: RandomPool_DeprecationWarning: This application uses RandomPool, which is BROKEN in older releases.  See http://www.pycrypto.org/randpool-broken
  RandomPool_DeprecationWarning)

dev-python/pycrypto-2.0.1* actually had Crypto.Util.randpool module. Your dev-python/pycrypto might had been installed for another version of Python.

README of dev-python/paramiko-1.7.6 contains:
Requirements
------------

  - python 2.3  <http://www.python.org/>
    (python 2.2 is also supported, but not recommended)
  - pycrypto 1.9+       <http://www.amk.ca/python/code/crypto.html>
    (2.0 works too)
