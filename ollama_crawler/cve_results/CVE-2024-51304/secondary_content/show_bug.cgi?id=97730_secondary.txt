Description

When I attempt to emerge and start any version of gnome-mud available in portage
(0.10.5/0.10.6/0.10.7), an alert pops up giving me the following error message;

"The default configuration values could not be retrieved correctly.
Please check your GConf configuration, specifically that the schemas have been
installed correctly."

When I dismiss this box, the program simply exits.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Emerge gnome-mud.
2. Attempt to start gnome-mud, from either the menu entry or the command line.

Actual Results:  
I recieve the error described above, and the program exits.

Expected Results:  
The program should start up normally.

Output from emerge info;

In case this helps anyone, I've recently found that it will run fine if I run it
as root. Obviously not an ideal solution, but it does work.

Running gnome-mud as root is a bad idea.  It works fine running as user here so
it's likely that you have some local config issue.  I recommend moving
~/.gnome-mud aside and trying again.

A good idea, but since I've never been able to get it to start as a user, there
is no ~/.gnome-mud directory :-/

Are there possibly any GConf settings that I could reset? I'm not very familiar
with how GConf works, so I don't know whether unmerging and reemerging the
package (which I've tried) will effectively uninstall and reinstall the GConf
data or if there are settings that linger...

sure.  Whack these files:

grep -ril gnome-mud /etc/gconf/

and remerge gnome-mud

Tried it, but it didn't make any difference. Also, it's worth noting that I
tried installing it from source with the traditional ./configure && make && make
install and I still got the same error. So it seems like this is probably not an
ebuild bug.

At this point, I can only think of three ideas as to what might be causing this
behavior where it works on your system but not on mine;

1) Something totally bizarre is screwed up on my system on a fundamental level
that causes everything to work fine except gnome-mud,
2) You're using a different version than I am of some piece of software that
gnome-mud depends on,
3) The fact that it's GConf that's complaining makes me wonder if perhaps
gnome-mud works IF you install it and run it for the first time while you're
using an older version of GConf. Perhaps then if you upgrade to the version of
GConf I'm running, it doesn't complain because the settings that it's telling me
are missing have already been created while running the older version of GConf.
If you're up to testing this theory, it seems like it would be a simple matter
of backing up and removing gnome-mud's settings, reinstalling gnome-mud from
scratch, and attempting to run it fresh out of the box.

However, since nobody else seems to be having this problem, perhaps I should
just mark it as WORKSFORME and forget about the whole thing....

same problem here. Works if started as root, but not as normal user.

I was having the same issue I 'fixed' it via:
gconftool-2 --install-schema-file=gnome-mud-0.10.7/gnome-mud.schemas

After unpacking the source of course 

I could run it now as a normal user.

Just tried this again and I'm still not able to reproduce it.  Sorry... marking WORKSFORME.  reopen if there's any new information.
