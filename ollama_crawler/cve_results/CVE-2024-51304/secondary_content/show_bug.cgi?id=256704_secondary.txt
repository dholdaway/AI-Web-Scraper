Now that portage-2.1.6 supports --jobs option, would be interesting being able to also use this option when emerge is run from revdep-rebuild


Thanks a lot

Reproducible: Always

revdep-rebuild ${REVDEP_OPTIONS} -- --jobs=x doesn't work?

I don't have any breakage now, but as seen in manpage it should work (/pacho slaps himself for not checking man page before :'( )

sorry a lot
