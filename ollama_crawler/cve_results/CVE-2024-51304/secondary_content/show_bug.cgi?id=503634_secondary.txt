After installing sys-process/cronie with anacron USE flag, anacron was never launched.

I understand that anacron is launched by cron thanks to /etc/cron.hourly/0anacron.
And this script isn't executable.
After doing chmod +x /etc/cron.hourly/0anacron, anacron is correctly executed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install sys-process/cronie
2. Wait for the execution of /etc/cron.{daily, weekly, monthly} scripts

Actual Results:  
Anacron is never executed and /etc/cron.{daily, weekly, monthly} scripts are never launched

Expected Results:  
Anacron should work at the installation

That's exactly how it ought to work. It doesn't get executed unless you want it to.

But in this case, is it possible to add a message in postinst ?
I searched for days before finding the solution. And there is no documentation about this behaviour.

In case it should only be run if the user explicitly sets it to be executable, maybe the test in /etc/crontab which is at the moment

[ ! -f /etc/cron.hourly/0anacron ]

should be set to

[ ! -x /etc/cron.hourly/0anacron ]
