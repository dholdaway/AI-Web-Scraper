evolution-2.24 compatibility patc for mail-notification-5.4 

see https://bugs.launchpad.net/mail-notification/+bug/251031

not sure if it is sane to patch the file directly and leaving the .gob alone.

updated ebuild, uses the patch and touches mn-evolution-server.gob.stamp  

rather ugly, evolution-2.24 as dependeny, a skilled ebuild writer might point out how to patch depending of installed evolution version.
the touch on the .gob wasn't necessary in all cases, i included it anyways, it won't hurt.
