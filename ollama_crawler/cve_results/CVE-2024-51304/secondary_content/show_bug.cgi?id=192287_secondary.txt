Description

Postfix is unable to get the MX record of domains. If the MX record matches with the domain address (A = MX) it works, if MX differs (like for example biggest websites like gmail, hotmail) it tries to connect to the A record of the domain and not to MX record.

Reproducible: Always

Please, don't abuse Gentoo Bugzilla for support questions. We have forums.gentoo.org, #gentoo and mailing lists for this.

If you still claim you've encountered a bug and this is not a misconfiguration on your part, you'll have to post a whole *lot* more info than 'oh it does not work', such as:

- affected postfix version(s)
- relevant parts of postfix configuration
- relevant parts of postfix logs that illustrate your problem
- emerge -pv postfix output
- emerge --info output.
