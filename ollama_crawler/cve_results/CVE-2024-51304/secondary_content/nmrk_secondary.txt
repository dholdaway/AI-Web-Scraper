 Newmark Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results 1NEW YORK - February 22, 2024 - Newmark Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: NMRK) ("Newmark" or "the Company"), a leading commercial real estate service provider to large institutional investors, global corporations, and other owners and occupiers, today reported its financial results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, and declared a quarterly dividend.Comments from Barry M. Gosin, Chief Executive Officer of Newmark1"Newmark’s revenues increased by over 23% in the quarter, with double digit gains in every revenue category. We completed the more than $50 billion Signature portfolio sale, the largest real estate loan sale in U.S. history. The fourth quarter of 2023 also saw Newmark close the year's largest industrial lease, largest office occupier lease, and largest office building sale in the United States. "We anticipate industry volumes accelerating throughout the second half of 2024. Due to our strong incremental margins and our investments in talent, we expect significant earnings outperformance towards the end of the year and into 2025. "We attract the best of the best. Already in 2024, we hired the preeminent affordable housing team, some of the most prolific and experienced debt and structured finance professionals, as well as one of the most innovative and active U.S. leasing teams. By empowering our extraordinary talent with world-class research, data analytics, and technology, they bring their best to Newmark’s clients. We refuse to let complacency impede progress in this rapidly evolving industry, we champion the entrepreneurial spirit. If you’re great, you should definitely be at Newmark."SELECT RESULTS COMPARED WITH THE YEAR-EARLIER PERIOD2Highlights of Consolidated Results(USD millions, except per share data)4Q234Q22ChangeFY 2023FY 2022ChangeTotal Revenues$747.4$607.323.1%$2,470.4$2,705.5(8.7)%GAAP income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests ("GAAP pre-tax income")82.418.5346.6%103.5154.6(33.1)%GAAP net income for fully diluted shares52.98.9493.4%42.6110.4(61.4)%GAAP net income per fully diluted share0.210.04425.0%0.240.45(46.7)%Adjusted Earnings before noncontrolling interests and taxes ("Pre-tax Adjusted Earnings")133.984.658.3%302.8441.4(31.4)%Post-tax Adjusted Earnings to fully diluted shareholders ("Post-tax Adjusted Earnings")114.476.549.5%258.7365.0(29.1)%Post-tax Adjusted Earnings per share ("Adjusted Earnings EPS")0.460.3243.8%1.051.49(29.5)%Adjusted EBITDA ("AEBITDA")166.2102.262.6%398.3510.7(22.0)%RECENT HIGHLIGHTS3–Newmark grew revenues from Leasing and other commissions by 19.6% year-on-year in the fourth quarter, which exceeded a more than 10% decline in industry-wide leasing activity. This was the fourth consecutive quarter in which the Company's leasing business gained meaningful market share. –Newmark gained significant market share in capital markets and grew revenues from Investment sales and Commercial mortgage origination, net, by 20.7% and 45.9%, respectively. This robust performance was led by fees from the Signature transactions, for which Newmark served as the FDIC's advisor. Even without the Signature transactions, the Company’s capital markets platform meaningfully outpaced the industry in the quarter.–Newmark was the number 2 broker in U.S. investment sales for the fourth quarter of 2023 and number 3 for the full year, according to preliminary data from MSCI, which excludes the $21.7 billion equity portion of the Signature transactions. Both were improvements compared with the Company's rank for the first 9 months of 2023 and full year 2022. –The Company increased revenues from Management services, servicing fees, and other by 19.9% year-on-year. –On January 12, 2024, the Company closed its offering of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.500% senior notes due January 2029 (the “Senior Notes”). 1 Please note the following: (i) Unless otherwise stated, all financial results and volume figures compare the fourth quarter of 2023 with the year-earlier period. (ii) The FDIC acted in its capacity as Receiver for Signature Bridge Bank, N.A. ("Signature"). For more on the deals mentioned in the quote, please see the section of this document titled "Other Useful Information". 2 U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles is referred to as “GAAP”. Newmark's fourth quarter and full year Adjusted EBITDA includes the receipt of $12.8 million of cash with respect to the favorable settlement of a litigation matter that was recorded as part of "other income". This gain was excluded for Adjusted Earnings calculations, which is consistent with the Company's non-GAAP methodology. See the sections of this document including, but not limited to, “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”, “Adjusted Earnings Defined”, “Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Common Stockholders to Adjusted Earnings Before Noncontrolling Interests and Taxes and GAAP Fully Diluted EPS to Post-Tax Adjusted EPS”, "Net Leverage", and "Liquidity", including any footnotes to these sections, for the complete and/or updated definitions of these and other non-GAAP terms and how, when and why management uses them, and the differences between results under GAAP and non-GAAP for the periods discussed herein. See also “Timing of Outlook for Certain GAAP and Non-GAAP Items” for a discussion of why it is difficult to forecast certain GAAP results without unreasonable effort. Please also see the table titled "Reconciliation of GAAP pre-tax income to GAAP pre-tax income excluding other income".3 For more on items including recent acquisitions and hires as well as any economic or industry data referenced herein, including Newmark's MSCI ranking, see "Other Useful Information". 1The following information was filed by Newmark Group, Inc. (NMRK) on Thursday, February 22, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.
