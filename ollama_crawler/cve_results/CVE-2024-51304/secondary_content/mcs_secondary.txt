 Inside Marcus Corp's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Income   Highlight
We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical losses, projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences.



 Other - Other   Highlight
The determination of the occurrence of a triggering event is based upon our knowledge of the theatre and hospitality industries, historical experience such as recent operating results, location of the property, market conditions, recent events or transactions, and property-specific information available at the time of the assessment.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Net losses on disposition of property, equipment and other assets were insignificant during fiscal 2023.

 Other - Other   Highlight
While the labor strikes were resolved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 with film production resuming thereafter, we expect the quantity of new film releases available for theatrical exhibition during fiscal 2024 to be negatively impacted by the prolonged shutdown of movie production resulting in several film release dates shifting to fiscal 2025.
