  31 May 2009; Ryan Hill <dirtyepic@gentoo.org>
  subtitleripper-0.3.4-r3.ebuild,
  +files/subtitleripper-0.3.4-glibc210.patch,
  +files/subtitleripper-0.3.4-libpng.patch:
  Fix building against newer libpng versions (bug #269803, patch by Victor
  Ostorga) and glibc-2.10.

>>> Source compiled.

I guess that must have solved it? Builds fine here with GCC 4.4.1.
