Description

I ever got the Error line
--- journalctl:
Feb 06 14:19:13 maci lightdm[83628]: Error updating user /org/freedesktop/Accounts/User1001: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.InvalidArgs: No such interface “org.freedesktop.DisplayManager.AccountsService”
--- /journalctl

Until (my workaround)
I have done a new symlink:
--- vdir:
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 43  6. Feb 14:48 /etc/systemd/system/dbus-org.freedesktop.DisplayManager.AccountsService.service -> /lib/systemd/system/accounts-daemon.service
--- /vdir

Due to BusName in
--- /lib/systemd/system/accounts-daemon.service
[Service]
Type=dbus
BusName=org.freedesktop.Accounts
---- 
there is a symlink already
--- vdir:
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 43  6. Feb 14:36 /etc/systemd/system/dbus-org.freedesktop.Accounts.service -> /lib/systemd/system/accounts-daemon.service
--- /vdir

My workaround makes the difference by introducing a new name, both links point to the same service:
/etc/systemd/system/dbus-org.freedesktop.Accounts.service
/etc/systemd/system/dbus-org.freedesktop.DisplayManager.AccountsService.service

I think this could be better configured by Gentoo, although this name confusion about the Accounts dbus may be an upstream thing somewhere to blame. 
I am unsure which ebuild: systemd / lightdm / dbus

Does this still happen on your system? I cannot reproduce this on any of mine, and if I understand D-Bus configs correctly org.freedesktop.DisplayManager.AccountsService is a lightdm-provided org.freedesktop.Accounts extension so it makes sense that it does not.
