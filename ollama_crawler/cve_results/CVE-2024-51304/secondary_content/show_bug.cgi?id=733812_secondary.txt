Something seems to have gone enormously wrong here:
 * ACCESS DENIED:  mkdir:        /usr/local/lib/cmake
mkdir: cannot create directory ‘/usr/local/lib/cmake’: Permission denied
 * ACCESS DENIED:  unlink:       /usr/local/lib/cmake
...skipped /usr/local/lib/cmake/boost_fiber-1.72.0 for lack of /usr/local/lib/cmake...

I feel like there must be something wrong with the environment this was being built in... Going to close for now, if it happens again we can open another bug.
