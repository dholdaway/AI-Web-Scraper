 Inside Perkinelmer Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Overall, we believe that our strategic priorities and recent portfolio transformations, coupled with our expanded range of product offerings, leading market positions, global scale and financial strength provides us with a foundation for continued revenue growth, strong margins and cash flows, and long-term earnings per share growth.



 Financial - Expense   Highlight
The summary pre-tax operating results of the discontinued operations, were as follows: During fiscal year 2022, we recognized $69.4 million of divestiture-related costs in selling, general and administrative expenses in discontinued operations, as compared to $7.5 million during fiscal year 2021, an increase of $61.9 million.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
Segment operating margin was flat in fiscal year 2021, as compared to fiscal year 2020, primarily due to higher sales volume and favorable product mix, offset by increased investments in new product development and growth initiatives.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Purchase accounting adjustments added an incremental expense of $2.9 million for fiscal year 2021, of which $2.8 million was change in contingent consideration and $0.1 million was increased depreciation on property, plant and equipment, as compared to purchase accounting adjustments increasing expenses by $3.5 million for fiscal year 2020, which was attributable to change in contingent consideration.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
We are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long-term rate of return on assets, the discount rate applied and mortality assumptions, to determine service cost and interest cost, in order to arrive at expected pension income or expense for the year.
