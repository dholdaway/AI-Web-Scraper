Description

          2008-01-29 17:38:41 UTC
        

crontab -l (to list my cronjobs)

gets: (you must be privileged error)
so, I review its fs.privs:

ls -l /var/spool/cron/

drwx-wx--T 2 root crontab 4096 Jan 28 10:11 crontabs

I am a member of the group 'crontab', so ... why can't I read(!) and write my own scheduled events?

is this file *supposed* to be set to 730+T(?) so that I cannot operate on my own crontab events?

Please advise.

Thanks



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge vixie-cron
2. /etc/init.d/vixie-cron start
3. (as user in separate shell): crontab -l

Actual Results:  
crontab tells me that I'm no-wash'n street trash; unworthy of a review of my own scheduled events.  Harrumph!


Expected Results:  
a concise dump of my current cronjobs

... and yes: /var/spool/cron/crontab/<user-file> is owned by <user> :)
