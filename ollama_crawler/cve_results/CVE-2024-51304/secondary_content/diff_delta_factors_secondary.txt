Diff Delta‚Ñ¢Ô∏è Under the Hood


Diff Delta‚Ñ¢ is GitClear's empirically-validated appraisal of how much durable change occurred per
commit.
Since making durable changes to code requires cognition, Diff Delta approximates
"cognitive load."


To assess durable change, Diff Delta follows the long-term fate of each line of code authored -- through moves, renames,
and other updates. Our proprietary method of weaving history together has a handy side effect for devs: It allows
more detailed & flexible diff viewing than whatever tools you've tried before
