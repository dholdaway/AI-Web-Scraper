Exhibit 99.1 767 Fifth AvenueNew York, NY 10153 News Contact:Investors: Rainey Mancinirmancini@estee.com Media: Jill Marvinjimarvin@estee.comTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES REPORTS FISCAL 2024 RESULTS Net Sales Decreased 2% and Diluted EPS Declined 61% to $1.08Organic Net Sales1 Decreased 2% and Adjusted Diluted EPS Declined 25% to $2.59Organic Net Sales Returned to Growth in the Second Half and Full Year Adjusted Operating Margin and Adjusted Diluted EPS Exceeded OutlookExpects Improved Performance Across Most Business Areas Partially Offset by Continued Soft Consumer Sentiment in China in Fiscal 2025New York, August 19, 2024 - The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE: EL) today reported net sales of $15.61 billion for its fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, a decrease of 2% from $15.91 billion in the prior year. Organic net sales decreased 2%, primarily reflecting ongoing softness in overall prestige beauty in mainland China and a decline in Asia travel retail driven by the decrease in the first half of fiscal 2024, reflecting actions taken by the Company and its retailers to reset inventory levels as well as lower conversion. Partially offsetting these declines was growth in Hong Kong SAR, overall in the markets of Europe, the Middle East & Africa (“EMEA”), Japan and Latin America. The Company reported net earnings of $0.39 billion, compared with net earnings of $1.01 billion in the prior year. The Company’s reported effective tax rate was 47.0%, compared with 27.7% in the prior year. This increase reflects the impact of nondeductible goodwill impairment charges associated with the Company’s Dr.Jart+ reporting unit, a higher effective tax rate on the Company's foreign operations due to the geographical mix of earnings and the unfavorable impact associated with previously issued stock-based compensation. Diluted net earnings per common share was $1.08, compared with $2.79 reported in the prior year. Excluding restructuring and other charges and adjustments as detailed on page 3, adjusted diluted net earnings per common share was $2.59, a 22% decrease in constant currency. The fiscal 2024 impact of business disruptions in Israel and other parts of the Middle East was $.06 dilutive to reported and adjusted net earnings per common share.Fabrizio Freda, President and CEO said, “In fiscal 2024’s fourth quarter, we achieved our organic sales outlook and exceeded expectations for profitability, closing a difficult year. Organic sales and adjusted EPS returned to growth in the second half. “For fiscal 2025, we anticipate continued declines in the prestige beauty segment in China, mainly reflecting persistent weak sentiment among Chinese consumers. We intend to drive share gains in a market that continues to hold strong long-term promise. In the rest of our 1 Organic net sales represents net sales excluding returns associated with restructuring and other activities; non-comparable impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures; as well as the impact of foreign currency translation. The Company believes that the Non-GAAP measure of organic net sales growth provides year-over-year sales comparisons on a consistent basis. See page 2 for reconciliations to GAAP.Page 1 of 23The following information was filed by Estee Lauder Companies Inc (EL) on Monday, August 19, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.
