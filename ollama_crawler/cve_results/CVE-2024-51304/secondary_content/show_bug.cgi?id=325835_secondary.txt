Thank you for report Michal. By idea plugins USE flag was provided only to install additional files required to build plugins. It was not supposed to install any plugins. At the same time currently most of plugins are unfinished/broken and will break psi, and this is another reason why we don't what plugins USE flag to install them. I think better solution exists in rion overlay:

http://code.google.com/p/rion-overlay/source/browse/#hg/net-im/psi-chess

- separate ebuild for each plugin. I think this is better way to handle them. So if there are plugins you use - create ebuild for them and open new bug report. Probably I'll include it into the tree or will suggest to put it into Sunrise. Thank you again but WORKSFORME as is.
