Here output:

Apparently nothing was received. Perhaps the connection failed.

We need new stable app-misc/ca-certificates (latest stable are 20130906-r1).

Works fine here on stable with ca-certificates-20130906-r1, can we see "emerge --info wget" (not wgetpaste but wget)?

Seeing the same thing here with bpaste.net.  Tried the two other https services (gists and lugons) and had no issues.  Tried upgrading to app-misc/ca-certificates-20140927.3.17.2, though still had issues with bpaste's certificate.

>Tried upgrading to app-misc/ca-certificates-20140927.3.17.2, though still had issues with bpaste's certificate.

This is due to the required COMODO cert being added only in the 3.17.3 version of nss, as evidenced by the attachment in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1088147

As ca-certificates in gentoo are being derived from nss, and as hinted by the "3.17.2" in the "20140927.3.17.2" version string, even upgrading to the latest present unstable ca-certificates is not enough to fix it.

Those who are less lazy than me should place a bump request for ca-certificates (and also a stabilization request, for bonus points. ca-certificates package hasn't been stabilized for over a year, and seeing how it creates problems for stable packages like wgetpaste, I can't say I understand its stabilization policy).

This only seems to be broken for a very small percentage of users, do you have any more ideas as to what the root cause could be? It's not as simple as "bpaste is broken with stable ca-certificates".  I've tested and it works with all these, on my system:

app-misc/ca-certificates-20140325.3.16.3
app-misc/ca-certificates-20140927.3.17.2
app-misc/ca-certificates-20141019.3.17.4

Odd, I can now wgetpaste to bpaste.net with app-misc/ca-certificates-20140927.3.17.2.

I'm going to consider this issue as resolved since I've tested this on a stable box and was able to paste at https://bpaste.net/show/fa9de6a540ed If this is not actually fixed please re-open.
