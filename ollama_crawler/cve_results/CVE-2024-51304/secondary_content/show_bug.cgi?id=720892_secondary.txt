Description


Agostino Sarubbo

This is an auto-filled bug because media-libs/grilo does not respect CFLAGS.
The issue was originally discovered on arm64, but it may be reproducible on other arches as well.
If you think that a different summary clarifies the issue better, feel free to change it.
Attached build log and emerge --info.

NOTE:
To reproduce this issue you may want to set CFLAGS="${CFLAGS} -frecord-gcc-switches".
