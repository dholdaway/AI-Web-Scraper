app-arch/cfv-1.18.3 has optional support for checking .torrent files that depends on net-p2p/bittorrent or net-p2p/bittornado.  The former is being removed for bug #336166.  Please keyword net-p2p/bittornado or mask the bittorrent USE flag for app-arch/cfv so I can drop the dependency from that ebuild.
