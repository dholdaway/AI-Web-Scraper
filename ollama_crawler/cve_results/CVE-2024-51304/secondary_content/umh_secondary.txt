(1)During
                                            2022, the Company incurred the carrying cost of excess cash for the redemption of preferred
                                            stock. Additionally, due to the change in sources of capital, amortization expense, a non-cash
                                            expense, is expected to become more significant and is therefore included as an adjustment
                                            to Normalized FFO for the three months and years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Definitions
 
Investors
and analysts following the real estate industry utilize funds from operations available to common shareholders (“FFO”), normalized
funds from operations available to common shareholders (“Normalized FFO”), community NOI, same property NOI, and earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and acquisition costs (“Adjusted EBITDA excluding Non-Recurring Other Expense”),
variously defined, as supplemental performance measures. While the Company believes net income (loss) available to common shareholders,
as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), is the most appropriate measure,
it considers Community NOI, Same Property NOI, Adjusted EBITDA excluding Non-Recurring Other Expense, FFO and Normalized FFO, given their
wide use by and relevance to investors and analysts, appropriate supplemental performance measures. FFO, reflecting the assumption that
real estate asset values rise or fall with market conditions, principally adjusts for the effects of U.S. GAAP depreciation and amortization
of real estate assets. FFO also adjusts for the effects of the change in the fair value of marketable securities and gains and losses
realized on marketable securities. Normalized FFO reflects the same assumptions as FFO except that it also adjusts for amortization of
financing costs and certain one-time charges. Community NOI and Same Property NOI provide a measure of rental operations and do not factor
in depreciation and amortization and non-property specific expenses such as general and administrative expenses. Adjusted EBITDA excluding
Non-Recurring Other Expense provides a tool to further evaluate the ability to incur and service debt and to fund dividends and other
cash needs. In addition, Community NOI, Same Property NOI, Adjusted EBITDA excluding Non-Recurring Other Expense, FFO and Normalized
FFO are commonly used in various ratios, pricing multiples, yields and returns and valuation of calculations used to measure financial
position, performance and value.
 
FFO,
as defined by The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”), is calculated to be equal to net income
(loss) applicable to common shareholders, as defined by U.S. GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real
estate assets, impairment charges related to depreciable real estate assets, the change in the fair value of marketable securities, and
the gain or loss on the sale of marketable securities plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization.
Included in the NAREIT FFO White Paper - 2018 Restatement, is an option pertaining to assets incidental to our main business in the calculation
of NAREIT FFO to make an election to include or exclude gains and losses on the sale of these assets, such as marketable equity securities,
and include or exclude mark-to-market changes in the value recognized on these marketable equity securities. In conjunction with the
adoption of the FFO White Paper - 2018 Restatement, for all periods presented, we have elected to exclude the gains and losses realized
on marketable securities and change in the fair value of marketable securities from our FFO calculation. NAREIT created FFO as a non-GAAP
supplemental measure of REIT operating performance.
 
Normalized
FFO is calculated as FFO excluding amortization and certain one-time charges.
 
Normalized
FFO per Diluted Common Share is calculated using diluted weighted shares outstanding of 67.2 million and 63.7 million shares for
the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, and 56.8 million and 55.3 million shares for the three months and year
ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Common stock equivalents resulting from stock options in the amount of 613,000 shares and 936,000
shares for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were excluded from the computation of Diluted Net Income (Loss)
per Share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. Common stock equivalents resulting from stock options in the amount of 315,000
shares and 571,000 shares for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were included in the computation of Diluted
Net Income (Loss) per share.
 
Community
NOI is calculated as rental and related income less community operating expenses such as real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance,
community salaries, utilities, insurance and other expenses.
 
Same
Property NOI is calculated as Community NOI, using all properties owned as of January 1, 2022, with the exception of Memphis Blues
and Duck River Estates.
 
Adjusted
EBITDA excluding Non-Recurring Other Expense is calculated as net income (loss) plus interest expense, franchise taxes, depreciation,
the change in the fair value of marketable securities and the gain (loss) on sales of marketable securities, adjusted for non-recurring
other expenses.
 
Community
NOI, Same Property NOI, Adjusted EBITDA excluding Non-Recurring Other Expense, FFO and Normalized FFO do not represent cash generated
from operating activities in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs, including
the repayment of principal on debt and payment of dividends and distributions. Community NOI, Same Property NOI, Adjusted EBITDA excluding
Non-Recurring Other Expense, FFO and Normalized FFO should not be considered as substitutes for net income (loss) applicable to common
shareholders (calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP) as a measure of results of operations, or cash flows (calculated in accordance
with U.S. GAAP) as a measure of liquidity. Community NOI, Same Property NOI, Adjusted EBITDA excluding Non-Recurring Other Expense, FFO
and Normalized FFO as currently calculated by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled, but variously calculated, measures
of other REITs.

“UMH
is pleased to report fourth quarter Normalized FFO of $0.23 per share as compared to $0.20 per share in the prior year period, representing
an increase of approximately 15%. UMH is strategically positioned to continue to increase earnings through the execution of our long-term
business plan. We have been acquiring vacant sites and land for development in desirable locations which have allowed us to rapidly fill
and develop our communities. The success of our investments in value-add communities and our expansions is demonstrated through our operating
results.”
 
“During
2023, we achieved a 23% increase in gross sales, installed and occupied over 1,000 new rental homes, improved same property occupancy
by 230 basis points and increased same property net operating income by 13%, or $12.2 million. Our communities continue to experience
strong demand for both sales and rentals. We anticipate delivering similar operating results in 2024, which should result in per share
earnings growth.”
 
“After
a two-year disruption from the COVID supply chain-related issues, abnormally high inventory levels and rising interest rates, we believe
we are back on track to deliver exceptional property operating performance and reliable earnings per share growth. Our financials have
been impacted by higher interest rates and inventory carrying costs, but we are pleased with our year over year normalized earnings per
share growth, our quarter over quarter normalized per share growth and our three sequential quarters of earnings per share growth.”
 
“Our
exceptional team has positioned the company to deliver organic growth in earnings and operating results through the infill of our 3,400
vacant lots and the development of our 2,100 acres of vacant land. We look forward to the continued execution of our long-term business
plan and generating value and exceptional returns for our shareholders.”

Note:
 

(1)Non-GAAP
                                            Information: We assess and
                                            measure our overall operating results based upon an industry performance measure referred
                                            to as Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Shareholders (“FFO”), which
                                            management believes is a useful indicator of our operating performance. FFO is used by industry
                                            analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure of a REIT. FFO, as
                                            defined by The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”),
                                            represents net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders, as defined by accounting
                                            principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”),
                                            excluding gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets, impairment
                                            charges related to depreciable real estate assets, the change in the fair value of marketable
                                            securities, and the gain or loss on the sale of marketable securities plus certain non-cash
                                            items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization. Included in the NAREIT FFO
                                            White Paper - 2018 Restatement, is an option pertaining to assets incidental to our main
                                            business in the calculation of NAREIT FFO to make an election to include or exclude gains
                                            and losses on the sale of these assets, such as marketable equity securities, and include
                                            or exclude mark-to-market changes in the value recognized on these marketable equity securities.
                                            In conjunction with the adoption of the FFO White Paper - 2018 Restatement, for all periods
                                            presented, we have elected to exclude the gains and losses realized on marketable securities
                                            investments and the change in the fair value of marketable securities from our FFO calculation.
                                            NAREIT created FFO as a non-U.S. GAAP supplemental measure of REIT operating performance.
                                            We define Normalized Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Shareholders (“Normalized
                                            FFO”), as FFO excluding certain one-time charges. FFO and Normalized FFO should be
                                            considered as supplemental measures of operating performance used by REITs. FFO and Normalized
                                            FFO exclude historical cost depreciation as an expense and may facilitate the comparison
                                            of REITs which have a different cost basis. However, other REITs may use different methodologies
                                            to calculate FFO and Normalized FFO and, accordingly, our FFO and Normalized FFO may not
                                            be comparable to all other REITs. The items excluded from FFO and Normalized FFO are significant
                                            components in understanding the Company’s financial performance.
 
FFO
and Normalized FFO (i) do not represent Cash Flow from Operations as defined by U.S. GAAP; (ii) should not be considered as alternatives
to net income (loss) as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities; and (iii)
are not alternatives to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. FFO and Normalized FFO, as calculated by the Company, may not be comparable
to similarly titled measures reported by other REITs.
 
The
reconciliation of the Company’s U.S. GAAP net income (loss) to the Company’s FFO and Normalized FFO for the three months
and year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are calculated as follows (in thousands):

were 67.2 million and 63.7 million shares for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, and 56.8 million and 55.3
million shares for the three months and year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Common stock equivalents resulting from stock options
in the amount of 613,000 shares and 936,000 shares for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were excluded from the
computation of Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. Common stock equivalents resulting
from stock options in the amount of 315,000 shares and 571,000 shares for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively,
were included in the computation of Diluted Net Income (Loss) per share.

(2)During
                                            2022, the Company incurred the carrying cost of excess cash for the redemption of preferred
                                            stock. Additionally, due to the change in sources of capital, amortization expense, a non-cash
                                            expense, is expected to become more significant and is therefore included as an adjustment
                                            to Normalized FFO for the three months and years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.
