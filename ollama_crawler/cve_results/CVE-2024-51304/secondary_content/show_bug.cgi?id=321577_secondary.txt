Neither /etc/uptimed.conf-dist nor /etc/uptimed.conf will be used by uptimed's init script.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. modify uptimed.conf under /etc
2. start uptimed with /etc/init.d/uptimed start

Ok, my fault...

Changing entries in /etc/uptimed.conf will be recognized by uptimed except the PIDFILE= value. Bug? It is hardcoded in the init script file.

Besides, it would be nice to see a little hint after emerging this package that the user have to copy uptimed.conf-dist in /etc/ to /etc/uptimed.conf and alter then this file to make config changes for uptimed.
