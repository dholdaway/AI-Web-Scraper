Today I found that my firefox displays an empty list of Add-ons, although varioud add-ons are in fact installed and active. I think this might a result of a recent Gentoo revbump, although I'm not sure of this.

Unfortunately the original 5.0 ebuild is no longer in portage. If I find the time, I'll recreate it from CVS and see whether the problem was present there.

Upstream has a related report from Mac OS X for Aurora:

http://dev.gentoo.org/~anarchy/mozilla/patchsets/firefox-5.0-patches-0.4.tar.bz2 is gone, so I can't emerge the 5.0 ebuild.

Try to run it from a terminal and look for errors, also post emerge --info output

No error messages on console.
emerge --info attached.

Tried to reproduce this issue with www-client/firefox-bin-5.0. There all add-ons are displayed as they should be. Next time I started firefox-5.0-r2, it displayed all add-ons, too. The "no messages on console" observation was before that, when the error still occurred.

As I didn't copy my FF profile directory before doing the test, I have no clue what setting exactly was changed by running the binary distribution. If anyone else encounters this same issue, please copy your profile before giving firefox-bin a try, and if you observe the same, diff those two directories.

This is probably invalid then, but will let mozilla team decide as maybe they have some idea about what could occur in your case

WORKSFORME I can understand, due to the lack of information, but INVALID I cannot, as this should not happen, thus it's a bug, thus not invalid. At least that's the way I read https://bugs.gentoo.org/page.cgi?id=fields.html#status
