 Inside Joby Aviation, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Shares   Highlight
The capital markets have in the past, and may in the future, experience periods of upheaval that could impact the availability and cost of equity and debt financing.



 Other - Other   Highlight
If the publication of the SFARs is further delayed, if the FAA requires further modifications to our existing G-1 certification basis, or if there are other regulatory changes or revisions, this could delay our ability to obtain type certification, and could delay our ability to launch our commercial passenger service.

 Other - Other   Highlight
If we are unable to add sufficient headcount it could impact our ability to meet our expected timelines for certification and entry into service.

 Other - Other   Highlight
While we expect to be first to market with an eVTOL facilitated aerial ridesharing service, we expect this industry to be dynamic and increasingly competitive; and our competitors could get to market before us, either generally or in specific markets.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
In addition, macroeconomic factors could impact demand for UAM services, particularly if end-user pricing is at a premium to ground-based transportation alternatives or more permanent work-from-home behaviors persist.
