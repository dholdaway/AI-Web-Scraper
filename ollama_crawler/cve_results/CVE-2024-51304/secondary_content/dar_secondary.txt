 Inside Darling Ingredients Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
While the Company has no ability to calculate a possible current liability for under-funded multiemployer plans that could terminate or could require additional funding under the PPA, the amounts could be material.



 Other - Other   Highlight
energy prices, a slowdown in the U.S. or international economy, high inflation rates or other factors, could cause the Company to fail to meet management's expectations or could cause liquidity concerns.

 Legal - Other   Highlight
These new or increasingly stringent legal or regulatory requirements could result in significantly increased costs of compliance and additional investments in facilities and equipment, and reduced raw material supplies in areas where these requirements limit or eliminate livestock operations.

 Other - Other   Highlight
These factors, coupled with volatile prices for natural gas and diesel fuel, currency exchange fluctuations, general performance of the U.S. and global economies, disturbances in world financial, credit, commodities and stock markets, and any decline in consumer confidence, including the inability of consumers and companies to obtain credit due to lack of liquidity in the financial markets, among others, could negatively impact the Company’s results of operations in fiscal year 2024 and thereafter.
