I have just done "emerge --sync" and "emerge -avuDN --with-bdeps y world"

portage says that:

"net-wireless/rfkill ("net-wireless/rfkill" is blocking sys-apps/util-linux-2.31)"

No. It is not a duplicate of bug #635158.
You probably had net-wireless/rfkill in world file, which prevented emerge from solving problem.
