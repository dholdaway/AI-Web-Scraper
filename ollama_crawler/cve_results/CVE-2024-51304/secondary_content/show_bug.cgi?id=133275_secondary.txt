Description

There should be a _big_ warning in the ebuild after the hint :
...
* One or more files have been config protected
* To complete your install, you need to run the following command(s):
*
* CONFIG_PROTECT="/var/www/localhost/htdocs/phpmyadmin//libraries" etc-update
...

b/c often the only change is a new value for "$cfg['Servers'][$i]['controlpass']" in the file /var/www/localhost/htdocs/phpmyadmin/libraries/config.default.php which should _not_ changed to keep a working installation up and running.

Been so for ages. It also tell you to update pmadb which you haven't done.
