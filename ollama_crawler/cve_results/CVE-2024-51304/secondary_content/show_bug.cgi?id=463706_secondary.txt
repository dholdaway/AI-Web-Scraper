cannot reproduce (tested python 2.7 and 3.2) and your build log seems weird...
esp, from your emerge --info:
proaudio
    location: /var/lib/layman/pro-audio
    masters: gentoo gamerlay mythtv proaudio
    priority: 0

Loux-s-Portage
    location: /var/lib/layman/planeshift
    masters: gentoo
    priority: 1

mythtv
    location: /var/lib/layman/MythTV
    masters: gentoo
    priority: 2

gamerlay
    location: /var/lib/layman/gamerlay
    masters: gentoo
    priority: 3


I would try removing these overlays temporarily and re-emerge lv2, it's likely some of them overlay an eclass and causes the failure. Please reopen if it still fails after disabling those overlays.
