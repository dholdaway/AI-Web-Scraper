Please, append this FLAG for compiling gtk-engines and enable progress bar animation:
-DHAVE_ANIMATION=1

Now, I am activating it doing:
CFLAGS="-march=k8 -msse3 -O2 -pipe -DHAVE_ANIMATION=1" emerge gtk-engines

Thanks

gtk-engines-2.8.x already passes --enable-animations to configure.
You just need a theme that enables animations, such as editing /usr/share/themes/Clearlooks/gtk-2.0/gtkrc to have
animation = TRUE instead of animation = FALSE

This is for current stable version, I haven't tried with testing version :-(

To the best of my knowledge (and of a quick skimming through gtk-engines ChangeLog), Clearlooks engine started testing with animations support around 2.7.0, with no such code going in the (at that time stable only-for-bug-fixes) 2.6 branch. If it did, then it certainly wouldn't be considered a stable feature in that version.

OK

Thanks a lot for information :-)
