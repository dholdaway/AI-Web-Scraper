Thunderbird might be vulnerable to more than just the Mozilla Foundation says
(it might be vuylnerable to much of the recent Firefox issues). At least
Madriva, RedHat and Ubuntu are quite convinced of this.

I asked for details, opening a bug do keep track of the issue.

Testing and marking those stable preventively might be a good idea :

mozilla-thunderbird Target KEYWORDS="alpha amd64 ia64 ppc sparc x86"
mozilla-thunderbird-bin Target KEYWORDS="amd64 x86"

Shouldn't thunderbird-bin also be marked stable on AMD64?

Alpha Stable ( 1.0.7 )

BTW, ia64 seems to be done and keyworded by agriffis (please Aron, CC'ed ia64
again if needed).

Ready for GLSA, waiting for more information about vulnerability of TB.




Comment 11

Here is the results of our ivestigation, thanks to Josh Bressers of RedHat :

- The XBM image decoder issue does not affect Thunderbird.
- The zero-width non-joiner sequences can just be used to crash TB
- The other flaws need Javascript (off in Thunderbird)

So I'll close this one as WORKSFORME. Feel free to reopen if you disagree.
