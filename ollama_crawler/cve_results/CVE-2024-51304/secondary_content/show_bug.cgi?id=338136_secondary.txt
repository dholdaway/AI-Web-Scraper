Description


Gabor Garami





          2010-09-20 10:42:53 UTC
        

Please, add pyopenssl as dependency for app-emulation/xen (and optionally ssl USE flag), because if SSL is enabled in xend-config.sxp, xend cannot start because missing OpenSSL module.

This dependency is needed in order to use SSL in:
* xend-tcp-xmlrpc-server
* xend-relocation-server

please add
