Hi!

I have redland installed on my system without problems but did not use it more than once. Anyway, I stumbled upon this error

"Package 'Redland' requires 'rasqal >= 0.9.12' but version of Rasqal RDF Query Library is 0.9.10"

when trying to install a package depending on redland (morla rdf editor). I suggest an update of the version of packages redland depends on. Especially rasqal.

cheers,
safak
