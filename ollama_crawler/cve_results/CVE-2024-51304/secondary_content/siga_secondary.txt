2023 Key Activity:
 



•

In 2023, SIGA had $131 million of product sales, including: approximately $98 million of fourth quarter product sales of oral TPOXX to the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile
              (“SNS”); approximately $11 million of product sales of oral TPOXX to the U.S. Department of Defense, of which approximately $6 million was recognized in the fourth quarter; and approximately $21 million of international sales, of which
              approximately $12 million was recognized in the fourth quarter.  In the first two months of 2024, the Company delivered an additional approximately $15 million of oral TPOXX to the SNS, substantially completing the oral TPOXX order received
              in July 2023, as well as delivered an additional approximately $7 million of oral TPOXX to European countries and Canada.



 



•

Highlighting the continuing diversification of the Company’s revenue base, the Company has received procurement orders for oral TPOXX from over 25 countries over the past two years.  As an example
                of the diversification trend, in October 2023, the Company reported the creation by the European Commission’s DG HERA (Health Emergency Preparedness and Response
                Authority) of a joint procurement framework contract under which participating countries from the European Union (EU) and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) can
                  efficiently order oral TPOXX.  Under this mechanism, $18 million of oral TPOXX was ordered by 13 countries in the fourth quarter, and revenues were recorded for deliveries on substantially of these orders in the fourth quarter or the
                  first two months of 2024.



 






Capital Management Activity:
 


On March 12, 2024, SIGA’s Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $0.60 per share, an increase of $0.15 per share from last year’s special cash dividend. 
        In 2023, the Company paid a special cash dividend of $0.45 per share, as well as repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares of its common stock.

ABOUT SIGA TECHNOLOGIES, INC. and TPOXX®
 

SIGA Technologies, Inc. is a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the
          health security market. Health security comprises countermeasures for biological, chemical, radiological and nuclear attacks (biodefense market), vaccines and therapies for emerging infectious diseases, and health preparedness. Our lead product
          is TPOXX®, also known as tecovirimat and ST-246®, an orally administered and IV formulation antiviral drug for the treatment of human smallpox disease caused by variola virus. TPOXX is a novel small-molecule drug and the US maintains a supply of
          TPOXX under Project BioShield. The oral formulation of TPOXX was approved by the FDA for the treatment of smallpox in 2018, and the IV formulation was approved for the same indication in 2022. The full label is available by clicking here. Oral tecovirimat received approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency
            (MHRA) in the United Kingdom in 2022. The EMA and UK approvals include labeling for oral tecovirimat indicating its use for the treatment of smallpox, monkeypox, cowpox, and vaccinia complications following vaccination against smallpox. The
            full label is available by clicking here. In September 2018, SIGA signed a contract with the Biomedical Advanced
            Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the office of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response within the U.S. Department of Health and
            Human Services, for additional procurement and development related to both oral and intravenous formulations of TPOXX. For more information about SIGA, please visit www.siga.com.
 






About Orthopoxviruses
 
Orthopoxvirus, belonging to the family of poxvirus that infect humans, include smallpox, mpox, cowpox and vaccinia.  Smallpox, a highly contagious and fatal disease, presents itself as a risk to global health security today given fears of its release accidentally or intentionally as a bioweapon.  Mpox virus, similar to smallpox,
        causes intermittent human infections, painful lesions, and possible case fatalities.  Mpox outbreaks have been observed recently in the US, Europe, and Central & West Africa.  Whether through natural occurrence or potential bioweapon warfare,
        orthopox threatens global health.  Anti-virals and vaccines serve as possible solutions to address these threats.
 
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
 


This press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended,
        including statements relating to SIGA’s future business development including securing new contracts and partnerships. The words or phrases “can be,” “expects,” “may affect,” “may depend,” “believes,” “estimate,” “project” and similar words and
        phrases are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to various known and unknown risks and uncertainties, and SIGA cautions you that any forward-looking information provided by or on behalf
        of SIGA is not a guarantee of future performance. SIGA’s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, some of which are beyond SIGA’s control, including, but not
        limited to, (i) the risk that BARDA elects, in its sole discretion as permitted under the 19C BARDA Contract (the “BARDA Contract”), not to exercise all, or any, of the remaining unexercised options under those contracts, (ii) the risk that SIGA
        may not complete performance under the BARDA Contract on schedule or in accordance with contractual terms, (iii) the risk that the BARDA Contract, U.S. Department of Defense contracts are modified or canceled at the request or requirement of the
        U.S. Government, (iv) the risk that the nascent international biodefense market does not develop to a degree that allows SIGA to continue to successfully market TPOXX internationally, (v) the risk that potential products, including potential
        alternative uses or formulations of TPOXX that appear promising to SIGA or its collaborators, cannot be shown to be efficacious or safe in subsequent pre-clinical or clinical trials, (vi) the risk that target timing for deliveries of product to
        customers, and the recognition of related revenues, are delayed or adversely impacted by the actions, or inaction, of contract manufacturing organizations, or other vendors, within the supply chain, or due to coordination activities between the
        customer and supply chain vendors, (vii) the risk that SIGA or its collaborators will not obtain appropriate or necessary governmental approvals to market these or other potential products or uses, (viii) the risk that SIGA may not be able to
        secure or enforce sufficient legal rights in its products, including intellectual property protection, (ix) the risk that any challenge to SIGA’s patent and other property rights, if adversely determined, could affect SIGA’s business and, even if
        determined favorably, could be costly, (x) the risk that regulatory requirements applicable to SIGA’s products may result in the need for further or additional testing or documentation that will delay or prevent SIGA from seeking or obtaining
        needed approvals to market these products, (xi) the risk that the volatile and competitive nature of the biotechnology industry may hamper SIGA’s efforts to develop or market its products, (xii) the risk that changes in domestic or foreign economic
        and market conditions may affect SIGA’s ability to advance its research or may affect its products adversely, (xiii) the effect of federal, state, and foreign regulation, including drug regulation and international trade regulation, on SIGA’s
        businesses, (xiv) the risk of disruptions to SIGA’s supply chain for the manufacture of TPOXX®, causing delays in SIGA’s research and development activities, causing delays or the re-allocation of funding in connection with SIGA’s government
        contracts, or diverting the attention of government staff overseeing SIGA’s government contracts, (xv) risks associated with actions or uncertainties surrounding the debt ceiling, (xvi) the risk that the U.S. or foreign governments' responses
        (including inaction) to national or global economic conditions or infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, are ineffective and may adversely affect SIGA’s business, and (xvii) risks associated with responding to the current mpox outbreak, as well as
        the risks and uncertainties included in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and SIGA's subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. SIGA urges investors and security
        holders to read those documents free of charge at the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov.  All such forward-looking statements are current only as of the date on which such statements were made. SIGA does not undertake any obligation to update
        publicly any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which any such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
