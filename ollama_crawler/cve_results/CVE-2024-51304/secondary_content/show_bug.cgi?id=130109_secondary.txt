This happens for Scite 1.62 at least. It is very easy to find. Simply open Scite, go to Help->About Scite, and it crashes on you.

Running Scite from the terminal, it gives this debugging information:

Gdk-ERROR **: unknown font type.
aborting...
Aborted

you should unmask the package and use those.
