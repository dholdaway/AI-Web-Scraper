Ago, any chance you can rerun the build with latest heimdal version?  I dont expect a change but it would be nice to check.

Heimdal is nearing a new release and maybe we can get this solved.

Thanks

In the past, there was https://github.com/heimdal/heimdal/issues/135, but it was fixed before this bug apparently.

I do see https://github.com/heimdal/heimdal/pull/191 but not relevant here I think.

In any case, 7.7.0-r3 builds fine for me on ppc64 at the moment.
