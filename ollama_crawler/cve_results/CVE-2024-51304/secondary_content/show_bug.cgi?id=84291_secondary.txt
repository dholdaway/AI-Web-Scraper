After filling in the form http://bugs.gentoo.org/attachment.cgi for a given bug, I click submit, then it asks me for my username and password - which i enter - then it gives me a page that says in red "You did not specify a file to attach."

I have tried from both Safari and IE. I have tried deleting my cookies. I have tried renaming the file. I have tried changing the file type. I have tried starting for a logged in and a logged out state initially.

i just tried from Firefox and it worked ! I suspect that Safari and IE don't put in the full path to the local file for some reason when you click on the Browse button. Talking on IRC - other people have had similar issues.

Reproducible: Always

Then again - went to send another file in Firefox and the exact same thing happened (got the same error message as IE and Safari). Its a very weird bug,

I tried this with a few different browsers on our test install and wasnt able to replicate it. Firefox and IE both on Windows and Linux. Re-post if its a recurring problem.

Thanks,
Jeffrey
