app-emulation/virt-manager lacks a dependency, after installing the package I cannot start the application:

$ virt-manager
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/share/virt-manager/virt-manager", line 33, in <module>
    from virtinst import util as util
  File "/usr/share/virt-manager/virtinst/__init__.py", line 89, in <module>
    from virtinst.distroinstaller import DistroInstaller
  File "/usr/share/virt-manager/virtinst/distroinstaller.py", line 23, in <module>
    from . import urlfetcher
  File "/usr/share/virt-manager/virtinst/urlfetcher.py", line 34, in <module>
    import requests
ImportError: No module named requests

Emerging dev-python/requests fixes the problem.

Having just checked, all three app-emulation/virt-manager currently in Portage *have* got dev-python/requests in RDEPEND. Whatever has triggered the problem, it is not a missing dependency.

Without the output of
  $ emerge --info virt-manager
it is hard to tell anything.

This might simply be either an issue with the Gentoo userland in question or a resolver bug. For the latter #155723.

I will close as resolved worksforme because in a clean stage-3 environment

  # emerge virt-manager

pulls in

  [ebuild  N     ] dev-python/requests-2.8.1  USE="{-test}" PYTHON_TARGETS="python2_7 python3_4 (-pypy) (-pypy3) (-python3_3) (-python3_5)"
