Description

ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~x86" emerge akode gave me:
<garb>
                  speex_decoder.cpp:260: error: `speex_decode_stereo_int' undeclared (first use this function)
                     make[4]: *** [speex_decoder.lo] Error 1

turned out had speex-1.1.7 installed, upgrading to speex-1.1.10 (~x86) fixed the akode build problems
