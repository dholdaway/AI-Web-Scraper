What's the output from: grep -i modes /etc/X11/xorg.conf

You're probably missing the resolution the games uses by default.

Hi thanks for the speedy reply. 
here it is : 

# grep -i modes /etc/X11/xorg.conf
      option      "MetaModes"   "1024x768-1024x768"
      Modes    "1024x768"

also it might be worthy to mention im using the mergedFB 
mode with a radeon 9250 , open source radeon driver.
the two screens are identical.

Any way out of this ?

Define more modes.  I have: 

"1920x1200" "1600x1200" "1280x1024" "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"

that's where i hit a snag .. 
Modes    "1024x768" so i added also 800 600 and 640 480 
for a spin .. that unfortunately didnt work .. 
so i asked myself .. ok that don't work so can i do it 
in the metamodes .. the  "MetaModes"   "1024x768-1024x768"
and add to it .. cause i sure didnt want to have lower resolution
than this bear minimum. .so i tried but always X reports back 
that i cant do that there's a config error .. 
ex of what i did ... 
 

option      "MetaModes"   "1024x768-1024x768" "800x600-800x600"
that failed .. also tried .. 
                          "1024x768-1024x768 800x600-800x600"
that failed too .. 

I mentioned i was using the mergedFB .. so i dont know if that pretty
much nails my coffin .. 

Sorry for the delay .. been working overtime tons. 

Sincerely yours   
Ric

Just tried again and it works fine for me.   go ahead and reopen if this is still a problem.
