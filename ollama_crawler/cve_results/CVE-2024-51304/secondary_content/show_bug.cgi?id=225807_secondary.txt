The /etc/init.d/keymaps should force non-empty DUMPKEYS_CHARSET if UNICODE is set to yes for otherwise ridiculous substitutions occurs. For example Polish (pl2) is dumped with latin-1 names instead of latin-2, hence lstroke becomes threesuperior.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set KEYMAP to  pl2 and leave DUMPKEYS_CHARSET empty.
2. Reboot.

Actual Results:  
Latin1 characters appear instead of Latin2 ones.

Expected Results:  
Polish Latin2 characters appear when typed.

i think the current configs are properly documented ... we cant check for every invalid scenario under the sun

Whilst for a lot of languages DUMPKEYS_CHARSET is relevant with UNICODE it's also not relevant for others. Hence I think that the current documentation is fine.
