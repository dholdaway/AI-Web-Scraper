LOUIS, February 8, 2024 – Peabody (NYSE: BTU) today reported fourth quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $192.0 million, or $1.33 per diluted share, compared to $632.0 million, or $3.92 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter.  Peabody had Adjusted EBITDA1 of $345.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $500.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.Full-year 2023 revenue totaled $4,946.7 million compared to $4,981.9 million in the prior year.  Full-year 2023 net income attributable to common stockholders totaled $759.6 million, or $5.00 per diluted share, compared to $1,297.1 million, or $8.31 per diluted share in the prior year.  Adjusted EBITDA was $1,363.9 million compared to $1,844.7 million in the prior year.  “Our performance in 2023 is a result of our dedicated team, diversified asset portfolio, and effective execution on our strategy,” said Peabody President and Chief Executive Officer Jim Grech.  “We delivered on our shareholder return program, repurchasing over 11 percent of our shares outstanding, and improved our seaborne metallurgical segment with new longwall kits at Shoal Creek and Metropolitan, the continued development of the Centurion premium hard coking coal project, and the pending acquisition of a large portion of the adjacent Wards Well coal deposit.”Fourth Quarter and Full Year Highlights•Reported full year Adjusted EBITDA of $1,364 million, operating cash flow from continuing operations of $1,116 million and $969 million of Cash and Cash Equivalents at December 31, 2023•Announced 2023 total shareholder returns of $471 million •Achieved second best annual global injury rate and record low injury rate in Australia•Produced 338 thousand tons from the newly developed L-panel district at Shoal Creek in the quarter •PRB shipped 23.6 million tons in the quarter, the highest quarterly volume since 2019•The Centurion premium hard coking coal project development remains on track with first development coal anticipated in April 2024•Established a new $320 million revolving credit facility in January 20241 Adjusted EBITDA and Available Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures.  Adjusted EBITDA margin is equal to segment Adjusted EBITDA divided by segment revenue. Revenue per Ton and Adjusted EBITDA Margin per Ton are equal to revenue by segment and Adjusted EBITDA by segment, respectively, divided by segment tons sold. Costs per Ton is equal to Revenue per Ton less Adjusted EBITDA Margin per Ton. Management believes Costs per Ton and Adjusted EBITDA Margin per Ton best reflect controllable costs and operating results at the reporting segment level. We consider all measures reported on a per ton basis, as well as Adjusted EBITDA margin, to be operating/statistical measures. Please refer to the tables and related notes in this press release for a reconciliation and definition of non-GAAP financial measures.1The following information was filed by Peabody Energy Corp (BTU) on Thursday, February 8, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.
