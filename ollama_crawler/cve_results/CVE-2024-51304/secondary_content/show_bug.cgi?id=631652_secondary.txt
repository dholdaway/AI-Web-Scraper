I noticed that gd.tumwien.ac.at is timing out for some days now.
User Antonin seems to be (somewhat?) responsible for it.

New mail address of Antonin?

Kind regards

I had contact with zid-help@support.tuwien.ac.at and they confirmed that gd.tuwien.ac.at is discontinued.

I guess gd.tuwien.ac.at needs to be removed from the mirror list :(

We don't know what the old IP was, if you have the IP we can remove it from our dns.

I am not aware that the IP changed.
Current one is 192.35.244.50

My emerge logs agree:
./portage/net-misc:remmina-1.2.0_rc19:20170730-171621.log:Resolving gd.tuwien.ac.at... 192.35.244.50
./portage/net-misc:remmina-1.2.0_rc19:20170730-171621.log:Connecting to gd.tuwien.ac.at|192.35.244.50|:80... connected.

Hope that helps.

oh... for some reason my local dns wasn't resolving it, confirmed though.  We don't have it in our dns as an active gentoo mirror (under rotation at rsync.gentoo.org or something).  I'll pass this over to the www team to remove from https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/mirrors/ though.

It seems to be working fine, mirrorstats says they are less than 2 hours out of date.

They did discontinue FTP.
