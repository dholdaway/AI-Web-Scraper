I do not if this is an exact duplicate of 2944, but when I attemp to shutdown the system via "shutdown", it hangs at "Setting hardware clock using the system clock [UTC] ..." However a "halt" stops the system immediately.

Where is the script that sets the hardware clock located? My OpenRc version string is "openrc (OpenRC) 0.21 (Arch Linux)".

That script is /etc/init.d/hwclock.

Also, you might want to upgrade to 0.21.2 because there was a fix in
that version wrt the way we call hwclock, see #584722.

Once you are running 0.21.2, feel free to re-open this if there is still
an issue.
