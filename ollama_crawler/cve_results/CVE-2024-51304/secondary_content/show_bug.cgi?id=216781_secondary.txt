Are you sure it doesn't work with some later version of the api although they use that old version? The servlet api doesn't change that much between versions.

No idea where to find one :-(

Just started to symlink jars that are available:

What do you think java-virtuals/servlet-api-2.2 provides :) Although the virtual is kinda moot since there is only one ancient provider. Which is dev-java/tomcat-servlet-api-3. Or the old dev-java/servletapi-2.2, but that package will be removed and is deprecated now. Should be using the servlet virtuals or direct packages that provide implementations, tomcat, resin, glassfish, etc.

Ah yes I remembered we didn't provide 2.2  but from 2.3 up.

We always provided it, just as dev-java/servletapi-2.2 which should be deprecated. Not sure how I can deprecate an entire package. I will mask it ASAP, but still migration is finished and stabilized can't do anything there.

Now I did switch to pulling sources from upstream archive mirror. Since that version we had our own sources for and provided that. Which I disliked, even though there really had been no changes.
