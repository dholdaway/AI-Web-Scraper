Description

See some errors ("warnings") when compiling. Having some errors when using in another package, possibly related... but first things first.

Initially, there is a problem finding ld.so.conf -- not looking in /etc/ for it. 

For whatever reason, "file not found" doesn't stop the build.

Then, later:

finally,

libtool: install: warning: remember to run `libtool --finish /usr/lib'

Not seen this command issued... so, what does all this mean?

I don't know if this package is properly built or not. Confidence level is pretty low with all those warnings. lafilefixer didn't help. revdep-rebuild didn't help.

I'm having some crashes "Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_text_layout_set_screen_width: assertion `layout->wrap_loop_count == 0' failed" in something built against these libraries, so want to know that the problem doesn't lie with these libraries.

Heh. I ran libtool --finish /usr/lib and now that Gtk-CRITICAL ** crash error is gone. Wow. Now what?

As far as I understand your post:
happy system breaking !!!
Cause that's what you're doing.
These libtool warnings don't indicate any problem,
they're standard.

Errors are not warnings.
