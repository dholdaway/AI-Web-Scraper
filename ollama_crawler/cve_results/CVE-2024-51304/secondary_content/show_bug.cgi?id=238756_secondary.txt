Description

          2008-09-26 11:38:26 UTC
        

Running exult:

XIO:  fatal IO error 11 (Resource temporarily unavailable) on X server ":0.0"

The program crashes and needs to be terminated with kill -9.

I checked out via SVN the trunk from:
https://exult.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/exult/exult/trunk

I then ran autogen.sh, then
./configure --disable-timidity-midi --disable-fluidsynth --enable-opengl

and finally make to get an exult executable.

This new executable, 1.4-cvs, works perfectly instead of the Gentoo-provided 1.2

Maybe the ebuild can be updated to use the SVN version...

works fine for me with stable x86.

attach the output from the attempted run and the out file if you run it with strace -o out /usr/games/bin/exult

There's to say that the SVN version also crashes (although differently) when the working directory is not the same directory where I compiled exult...

I suspect that the cryptic "XIO:  fatal IO error 11" message is caused not by X11 problems but by sound/midi misconfiguration. I witnessed the sameerror yesterday after compiling exult for Acer Aspire One Linpus Linux and copying .exult.cfg from my Debian notebook to AA1.

On Debian, exult was built with timidity and the config file had sound enabled (with GS midi conversion IIRC).

Exult on AA1 was compiled without midi and I think it crashed while trying to perform the abovementioned MIDI conversion. I edited .exult.cfg to turn both sound and music off, and exult started OK. On tomorrow morning I just installed timidity with its patches and libraries and recompiled exult with timidity support. Now it works OK and plays music too.

please attach your ~/.exult.cfg file as text/plain.

So far it sounds like exult just hasn't been configured properly.

sorry but I no more own a Gentoo box to test this.

I also suppose it was a "default configuration bug"

thanks for the support
