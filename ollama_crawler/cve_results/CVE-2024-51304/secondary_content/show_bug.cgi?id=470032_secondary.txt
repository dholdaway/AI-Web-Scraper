Hi Ryan,

Could you confirm that LTO use flag will not be enabled by default?
It is not clear from the changelog.

I have an ebuild (hashkill) in pentoo overlay which relies on that and need to know if I need to fix it or the last change went wrong.

I still see 
  tc_version_is_at_least "4.6" && IUSE+=" lto"
in the toolchain.eclass but somehow it is not enforced.

Cheers,
Anton

No flags are enabled by default.  That would require EAPI 2, which the eclass isn't.  You will have to add a USE flag dep to your ebuild.
