I just emerged net-proxy/privoxy-3.0.6 and it fails to launch, apparently 
because of the following configuration error:
=================================================
Mar 19 22:25:59 Privoxy(b7d916b0) Info: Privoxy version 3.0.6
Mar 19 22:25:59 Privoxy(b7d916b0) Info: Program name: /usr/sbin/privoxy
Mar 19 22:25:59 Privoxy(b7d916b0) Fatal error: can't load actions 
file '/etc/privoxy/default.action': invalid line (1144): 
{+fast-redirects -block}
=================================================

It seems that changing {+fast-redirects -block} to {+fast-redirects{check-decoded-url} -block} as suggested by P Ruskin works fine.

You may want to check this and fix accordingly.

There is no fix to make, because the fix is already in 3.0.6 - try:

grep fast-redirects /var/tmp/portage/net-proxy/privoxy-3.0.6/work/privoxy-3.0.6-stable/default.action.master

Thanks Paul,

Should I try that while it is compiling?  Because I don't seem to have a net-proxy in /var/tmp/portage.

You should run etc-update or dispatch-conf next time... :)

I beg your pardon for the noise, I am sure I did run etc-update and it updated all the privoxy config files.  I remember accepting the changes in /etc/privoxy/default.action - perhaps I pressed the wrong button?  Anyhow, it works now.
