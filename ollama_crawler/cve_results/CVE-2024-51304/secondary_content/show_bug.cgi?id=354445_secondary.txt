This is from the original bug report (full details given in the URL) :

>No need to blame yourself. The problem here is with Gentoo's eselect opengl
>script, which doesn't care enough about debug symbol files when shuffling

Reproducible: Always

Possibly app-admin/eselect-mesa needs to be adapted too.

First I'd like to get feedback for this change.

Wait a minute... gdb does symlink resolution on its own:

Reading symbols from /usr/lib64/opengl/xorg-x11/lib/libGL.so.1...Reading symbols from /usr/lib64/debug/usr/lib64/opengl/xorg-x11/lib/libGL.so.1.2.debug...(no debugging symbols found)...done.
(no debugging symbols found)...done.
Loaded symbols for /usr/lib64/opengl/xorg-x11/lib/libGL.so.1

I don't know why there are no symbols read from that file but gdb certainly finds it. And won't even look for some wannabe symlinks.
