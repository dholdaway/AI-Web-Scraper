"A package installing a kernel module I would like in my initramfs has
not gained the "initramfs" USE flag. How do I proceed?

    Please report a new bug on bugs.gentoo.org, requesting that the
    package maintainer consider adding support to the package for
    including the modules in the initramfs.
"

Thanks for considering!

But it's already in zfs-kmod?

commit 0ef34366cbc67e4796f07dbc8b7433d20af8fc22
Author: Andrew Ammerlaan <andrewammerlaan@gentoo.org>
Date:   Wed May 8 08:05:49 2024 +0200

    sys-fs/zfs-kmod: add USE=initramfs, and enable by default

    Signed-off-by: Andrew Ammerlaan <andrewammerlaan@gentoo.org>

What we *could* do is merge https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo/pull/36718 like Andrew proposes, but that's tangential.

(If there's a reason we should do zfs itself, let me know & feel free to reopen though. Maybe it's useful to have the tools in there although I've never used them in there.)
