Proposed ebuild that doesn't enforce x11-misc/notification-daemon

virtual/notification-daemon with use flag gnome depends on x11-misc/notification-daemon, which is mutually exclusive with x11-misc/notify-osd.
I don't see, why Gnome forces to use notification-daemon and prohibits canonicals notify-osd.
Of course, there can be only one of the, so I would change the virtual ebuild.

Because there is no x11-libs/gtk+:3 version of notify-osd and I don't have any idea if it works on GNOME 3 or not. 
At this point I wouldn't change the dep anymore only for GNOME 2 purposes.

Thus

Reassign to gnome@ maintainers so they can check if notify-osd is suitable replacement for notification-daemon in GNOME 3

USE=gnome is supposed to represent the default GNOME setup. notify-osd is not a GNOME project, and hence cannot be placed under USE=gnome for virtual/notification-daemon.

However, it *can* be used with GNOME without any problems. Please set "virtual/notification-daemon -gnome" in package.use, this should fix your problem.

But I think it could be a possibility to use with gnome...
Without changing the Use-Flag.
But well...

I also disagree with having a USE "gnome" in virtual simply to make more difficult to use alternative notification daemon providers if they work ok with gnome
