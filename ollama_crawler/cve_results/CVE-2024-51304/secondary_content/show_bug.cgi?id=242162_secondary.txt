When building dev-util/cmake-2.6.2 on AMD64 with USE="emacs qt4 vim-syntax", I get several warnings.  I don't know which of them are safe to ignore and which aren't.

[...]
-- Configuring done
CMake Warning at Source/CMakeLists.txt:426 (ADD_EXECUTABLE):
  Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target ctest because files
  in some directories may conflict with libraries in implicit directories:

    runtime library [libz.so] in /usr/lib64 may be hidden by files in:
      /lib64
    runtime library [libm.so] in /usr/lib64 may be hidden by files in:
      /lib64

  Some of these libraries may not be found correctly.

CMake Warning at Source/QtDialog/CMakeLists.txt:64 (ADD_EXECUTABLE):
  Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target cmake-gui because
  files in some directories may conflict with libraries in implicit

They are definetly safe to ignore.
I promise you that you wont have to awake cause of them from your sleep :]
These are just harmless warnings :]
