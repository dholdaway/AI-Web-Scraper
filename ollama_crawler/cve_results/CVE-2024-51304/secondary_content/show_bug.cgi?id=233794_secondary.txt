Description

          2008-08-03 13:19:18 UTC
        

I have a small problem that really drives me crazy!

I found out that when stopping / restarting Metalog the buffered log is thrown away, instead to be flushed into file. 
Also I found no way to configure lines / interval until a flush occurs.

So I unmerged Metalog to give syslog-ng a try. I managed to configure lines buffered until written to disk. I found out that syslog-ng flushes every 10 seconds even if buffer line size is not reached, but when stopping/restarting daemon while the most recent log data is still in output buffer the data is dropped.

My question is WHY?! It should be self-evident for such an important program to flush their buffer before terminating!

PS: I tested it using kernels: gentoo-2.6.25-r7  and gentoo-2.6.20-r6.

PPS: Im not sure, but I think I can remember that Metalog were flushing to file when using /etc/init.d/Metalog restart some time ago. But since that time it worked for me I updated my gentoo multiple times (kernel, libriaries, ...)



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. tail -f /var/log/...

2. Create script:
#!/bin/bash
logger Test1
logger Test2
logger Test3
logger Test4
logger Test5
logger Test6
logger Test7
logger Test8
logger Test9
logger Test0
/etc/init.d/syslog-ng restart
(or)
/etc/init.d/metalog restart

3. Run script

4. Watch tail output
Actual Results:  
Log data is being lost...


Expected Results:  
Buffered data flushed to disk, then terminating.

Please post your `emerge --info' too. Also, does it help to call `sync'?

I tried to call sync before and after restart, it did´t help.

So, the call to /etc/init.d/syslog-ng restart is part of your script?  I don't see the issue that you're talking about here.  All logger lines appear in /var/log/messages as expected.

Please attach your /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf file as text/plain.

Yes /etc/init.d/syslog-ng restart is part of the script is it called directly after the output via logger. If I add a sleep(11) between logger and the restart the lines are flushed before the daemon is restarted (because it seams this "flush all 10 seconds" is the default behaviour from syslog-ng) , but otherwise these lines are just dropped.

Metalog did not flush time dependant, it waits until enough (no idea how much) data is there. If I restart system some of the last lines are dropped.

Maybe there is a bug in one of the libraries / system calls which prevent the flush/sync when daemon is stopped.

You've changed the default config from sync(0) to sync(50).  Go ahead and change it back and try again.

Well, I've tested with your script on my computer:
1. syslog-ng works if you set sync(0) in config file
2. metalog works our of box

So it WORKSFORME...

          2008-09-16 00:19:55 UTC
        

sync(0) is the default setting for syslog-ng with the Gentoo-installed config so WORKSFORME as well.

metalog-0.8-flush_on_exit.patch

This actually *is* a bug in metalog itself. In case it is killed
while being in buffered mode, it looses all its unflushed messages.

See patch.

This is a slightly modified and rev bumped ebuild to apply the patch.

There also is an error in metalog's init script which results in 
the inability to actually write the pid file.

See modified metalog.initd

Btw. all changes can also be found in my overlay at
http://repo.or.cz/w/gentoo-overlay-ibormuth.git?a=tree;f=app-admin/metalog

Replace former patch by a simpler version. Sorry.

should be fixed with metalog-0.9
