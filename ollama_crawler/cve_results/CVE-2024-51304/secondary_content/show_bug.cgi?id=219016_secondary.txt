Most distfiles will be on the gentoo mirrors so you can save your list of names then do a simple for loop to wget all the files off of your favorite gentoo mirror.

Created attachment 150707 [details]
list-distfiles

I use the above script for this purpose. It takes the same arguments as emerge, for example :

./list-distfiles mozilla-firefox
./list-distfiles -uDN world

It will list all required distfiles, including all those you already have in /usr/portage/distfiles. That's a choice I made since some upstreams tend to change their tarballs without warning, which is very annoying when you're out in the wild without a connection.

Denis.

Could you try and see if what you want is in any way different from doing
  emerge --fetchonly -p [category/package ..]

That will produce a list of URIs like so:

# emerge --fetchonly -p app-portage/euses app-text/pinfo --nodeps

These are the packages that would be fetched, in order:
