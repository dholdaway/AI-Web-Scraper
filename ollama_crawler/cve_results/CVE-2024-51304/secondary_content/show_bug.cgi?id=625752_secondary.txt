Both qt-creator most recent unstable packages go to a crawl while using its embedded help system, when they are built using qtwebengine.

When both are built with USE=-webengine the help system is as fast as the other modules.

Thanks!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. build qt-creator ~amd64 version with USE=webengine
2. run the help system, it goes very, very, very slow;
3. build qt-creator ~amd64 version with USE=-webengine
4. run the help system fast as lightning.
Actual Results:  
USE=webengine  - the help pages look much better, but too slow;
USE=-webengine - the help pages look not as nice, but pretty faster;

Expected Results:  
help system as fast as the other modules, like the text editor and UI graphical editor.

Maybe qtwebengine is simply slow on your hardware... can you try other applications that use qtwebengine?

I am not seeing this issue here - Core i5-7200u on a Thinkpad X270. Admittedly a pretty quick machine, but maybe backs up Davide's assertion about the speed of the hardware?
