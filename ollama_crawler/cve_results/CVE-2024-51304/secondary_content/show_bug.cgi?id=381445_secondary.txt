Description


Erik Wallin





          2011-09-01 15:10:43 UTC
        

I compiled the new release of asterisk. There is no need to modify the ebuild
from 1.8.5.0-r3.

09-manager-http-segfault.patch has been applied upstream so that can be removed.

I've updated a few of the patches with links to the new Mantis issue tracker att asterisk.org.

03-iax2-peerstate.patch is scheduled for inclusion in asterisk 10. I've added a comment that it should be removed once 10 is released.


Reproducible: Always

I filed this before the 1.8.6.0 ebuild was in the CVS tree. The only really important change was applied there.

Thank you for your report, sorry for the bad timing.
