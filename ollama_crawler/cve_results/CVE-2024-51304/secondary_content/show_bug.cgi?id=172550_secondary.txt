Maybe this is a completely stupid question but I simply can not see a reason why is a 2007.0 tracker inaccessible. Is it security related or something else? I think it should be at least readable to everyone - many users would love to know what is going on.

Reproducible: Always

This isn't a release wishlist. This is for developer use only. I'm restricting
this to developers only.

That's the only reason. And, there's no way to make a bug read-only, so it needs to remain as it is.

Yeah I was afraid that there is this reason :-) It's pity that Bugzilla is missing this kind of feature.

Thanks for clarification.
