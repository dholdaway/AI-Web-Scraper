Standard command line utilities "lpstat", "lpoptions", etc.. are giving no output (either in bash, or in Xterm).  CTRL-C returns shell prompt, but provides no debugging information.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type "lpstat -a" at shell prompt
2. Or type "lpstat <printer>" at shell prompt


Actual Results:  
No output ... does not return shell prompt ... hangs

Expected Results:  
Standard output or standard error.

Just downgraded to 1.2.10, and the problem persists.  Perhaps I have a corrupted config file?

The following steps resolved the problem:

1. emerge --unmerge cups
2. mv /etc/cups/* /home/username/tmp/
3. emerge cups  

I hate not knowing what caused the problem ,,,, but at least it is now working.  Please let me know if it would be helpful for me to perform any further tests, or to submit any further materials relevant to the problem.
