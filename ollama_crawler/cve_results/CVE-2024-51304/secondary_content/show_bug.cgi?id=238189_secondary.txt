when i plug in my hp psc3180 aio printer, a device node is created with the following permissions:
crw-rw-r--  1 root scanner 189, 2 2008-09-20 17:43 003

which results in cups not being able to print.

doing a chown root:lp on the node and cups prints fine.

this arch bug may be related:
http://bugs.archlinux.org/task/8240

i have:
media-gfx/sane-backends-1.0.19-r1  USE="usb -doc -gphoto2 -ipv6 -v4l"
net-print/hplip-2.8.6b  USE="dbus ppds qt3 qt4 scanner -cupsddk -doc -fax -minimal -parport -snmp"

thanks
kind regards
Thilo

I have got the same problem with my digital camera Canon PowerShot S5 IS. If I connect it, new device is created (/dev/usbdev*) and it has wrong permissions (crw-rw---- 1 root root). I suppose it is UDEV problem.

jiri tyr: just because our two problems have similar symptoms does not mean they are related.

anyway - i recently reinstalled my system an it now seems to work just fine.
