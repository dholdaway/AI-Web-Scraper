Description

Hi,

this ebuild is a copy of the games-util/qstat/qstat-2.10.ebuild with the exception that it uses the sources from the official CVS hosted at SourceForge.net and creates it's 'configure' file with the use of autogen.sh before configuring and compiling. (This ebuild blocks the games-util/qstat package, of course.)

I came up with this idea, because qstat is a great tool, but their release-cycle is not so good if you want to use it for recent games. To have qstat support the most recent games, you have to use the CVS version which is stable and compiled and works without problems here (x86).

This ebuild should be filed under games-util/qstat-cvs so it's as easy to find as the qstat package.

As you might've noticed, I chose 2.11 for the version. This is because the latest release of qstat is 2.10.

Best regards,
Johannes
