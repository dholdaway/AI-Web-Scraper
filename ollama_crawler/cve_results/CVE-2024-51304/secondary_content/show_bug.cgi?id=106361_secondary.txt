Description

When running bind in a vserver, you need to disable capabilities support for
bind using the compile parameter "--disable-linux-caps", but the ebuild doesn't
provide this function.

I've worked around the problem by changing the existing ebuild and building a
custom one, but I'd like to see this parameter added if possible.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. add "-caps" to your use variable
2. run "ebuild bind"
Actual Results:  
bind will still be compiled with capabilities support and cannot be started in a
vserver

Expected Results:  
capabilities support should have been disabled to make it work in a vserver

USE="-threads" emerge bind

bind needs caps for threads (SMP) support, so this flag was removed.
