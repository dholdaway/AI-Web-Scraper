Description


Marius Brehler





          2011-10-14 16:46:22 UTC
        

A Visual Profiler Patch is available for CUDA 4.0.17. This should be added to the current 4.0 ebuild.

Quote form nvidia.com:
This patch is specifically to address the following Visual Profiler 
issue for profiling applications using multiple streams:
 Visual profiler reports an error:
  "In this profiling session some profiler output rows are dropped 
   due to incorrect gpu time stamp values and the profiler output 
   is incomplete."


It can be downloaded form
http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/4_0/toolkit/patch/visualprofiler_4.0.51_linux_32_ubuntu10.10.tar.gz or
http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/4_0/toolkit/patch/visualprofiler_4.0.51_linux_64_ubuntu10.10.tar.gz
depending on the architecture. At least I think you use the ubuntu tarball for installing the CUDA toolkit.
Best Regards

Marius

Do we still need this with version 5?

The patch is only needed for CUDA 4.0.17. Newer versions should already include the fix.

Actually I don't know if it is still needed, another option would be to drop visual profiler support by removing the "profiler" useflag. It should only be fixed if there is ongoing support for CUDA 4.0.
