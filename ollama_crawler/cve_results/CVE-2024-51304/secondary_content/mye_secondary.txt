Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
Myers Industries Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Results
Self-Help Initiatives and Myers Business System Drive Solid Operating Performance
Company Initiates Fiscal Year 2024 Outlook and Expects Improved Profitability as Compared to Prior Year
Myers to Host Investor & Analyst Day Event in New York City on March 19, 2024
 
March 5, 2024, Akron, Ohio - Myers Industries, Inc. (NYSE: MYE), a leading manufacturer of a wide range of polymer and metal products and distributor for the tire, wheel, and under-vehicle service industry, today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
In reviewing the 2023 financial results, Myers Industries’ President and CEO Mike McGaugh commented, “Although our results were not what we originally planned to deliver in 2023, we remain encouraged by the resiliency of many of our business units despite continued cyclical headwinds in several of our key end markets.  Demonstrating the strength of our diverse portfolio, 2023 marked a year of continued progress and still yielded one of the top years in the history of our company for adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA, and revenue.  Further, year over year operating cash flow generation increased by $13.6 million and free cash flow generation increased by $15.0 million, as we continue to benefit from early implementation of the Myers Business System to help drive Operational Excellence.” 
Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Highlights
•Net sales of $191.1 million compared to $212.8 million in the prior year period 
•Gross margin of 30.0%, down 60 basis points versus the prior year period
•GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.34 compared to $0.36 in the prior year period
•Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.29 compared to $0.32 in the prior year period
•Cash flow provided by operations was $15.4 million and free cash flow was $11.8 million
Full Year 2023 Financial Highlights
•Net sales of $813.1 million compared to $899.5 million in the prior year period 
•Gross margin of 31.9%, up 40 basis points versus the prior year period
•GAAP net income per diluted share of $1.32 compared to $1.64 in the prior year period
•Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.39 compared to $1.68 in the prior year period
•Cash flow provided by operations was $86.2 million and free cash flow was $63.3 million
•Subsequent to fiscal year end, closed on acquisition of Signature Systems, enhancing Myers' long-term margin and EPS growth profiles
 
Myers Industries’ President and CEO Mike McGaugh continued, “In closing 2023, our Material Handling segment delivered respectable fourth quarter financial results with continued strong margins in-spite of demand headwinds in RV, Marine, and Consumer end-markets. We continue to see results from our Operational Excellence and Commercial Excellence initiatives, what we call our Self-Help programs.  As a result, when these cyclical end markets improve, we expect to benefit more than we have historically."
