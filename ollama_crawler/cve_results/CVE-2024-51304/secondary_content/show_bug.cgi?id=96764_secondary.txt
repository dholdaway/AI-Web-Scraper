It would by nice if the ebuild names in the output of equery could be directly piped to emerge.

The current output (if not a terminal) looks like sys-apps/python-2.2.1-r2. A very useful format would be the form sys-apps/python so "equery belongs /lib/modules | xargs emerge" could update all kernel-dependent packages after kernel upgrade.

Currently "equery belongs /lib/modules | sed 's/^/=/' | xargs emerge" does the job, but the drawback is that it doesn't update to newer packages.

I'm undecided on this one:

In the meantime "equery belongs /lib/modules | sed
's/-r[0-9].*$//;s/\(^.*\/*\)-.*$/\1/' | xargs emerge" will do what you want.

My concern is that package versions show lots of anomalies ranging from 5b
(portmap), alpha5 (libtheora), pre7 (module-init-tools) to v3 (libstdc++),
libxml2, ipw2200 and so on. So it is really hard to cut off the version.

However I have discovered sys-kernel/module-rebuild in portage which is what I
seek. If you wish, mark this report as WONTFIX.

But thank you for your precious time.
