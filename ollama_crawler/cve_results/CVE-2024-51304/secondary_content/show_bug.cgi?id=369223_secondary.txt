Description

After I upgraded to the new xulrunner belonging to firefox-5 hell broke loose :)

gjs is broken (which shows itself on my system by a dying gnome-shell) and cannot be rebuild against xulrunner-5.

From the stack-trace it seems like gjs_init_context_standard calls JS_InitStandardClasses somehow wrong.

The rebuild fails telling me that JSScript has not been defined.

From the git-log it seems like there are some fixes (against xulrunner-2.2, but I'll guess that this is the same as xulrunner-5), I will try gjs-9999 now.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install xulrunner-5
2. Launch a gjs application like gnome-shell
Actual Results:  
Crashes immediately.

Indeed gjs-9999 works, I'll try to compile a patch.

I don't think have much sense to try to handle gjs compatibility with xul-5 at this time, I am sure it will be solved by upstream when xulrunner-5 is more near to stable

I hate to say but xulrunner is gone.

In tree firefox now have xulrunner build with firefox , not separately.
