Description

I'm trying to debug my portage (awfully slow, takes minutes to compute deps on a very-high-end computer)

berlioz ~ # eix-test-obsolete 
/usr/bin/eix-test-obsolete: riga 17: ReadGettext: comando non trovato
/usr/bin/eix-test-obsolete: riga 69: Push: comando non trovato
/usr/bin/eix-test-obsolete: riga 70: Push: comando non trovato
/usr/bin/eix-test-obsolete: riga 72: opt: variabile non assegnata

Those calls are indeed at said lines in the bash script.. i guess they are supposed to be functions imported from somewhere.

can not reproduce this on an old i7 with SSD

$ time eix-test-obsolete
.....
real	0m9.979s
user	0m9.790s
sys	0m0.259s

It is fast and I  do not see your messages.

It is sad to read that you have problems with the software. The situation seems to be a bit more complicate and requires some analysis.
We can not help you efficiently via bug tracker. The bug tracker aims rather on specific problems in .ebuilds and less on individual systems. 

I have had very good experience on the gentoo IRC [1] with questions like this. Of course there are also forums and mailing lists [2,3].
I hope you understand, that I will close the bug here therefore and wish you good luck on one of the mentioned channels [4].
Please reopen the ticket in order to provide an indication for an specific error in an ebuild or any gentoo related product.
