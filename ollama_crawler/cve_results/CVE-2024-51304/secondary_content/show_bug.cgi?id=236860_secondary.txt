Description

I've recently installed gentoo on nVidia nForce3 250Gb board. It has a built in AC'97 Audio Controller with SPDIF output. I followed the Gentoo Linux ALSA Guide (http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/alsa-guide.xml) after which speaker-test produced no sound (no errors either though). I emerged madplay and mplayer, they also played no sound. 

I read that to get digital sound to work, this was required in your .asoundrc:
pcm.!default {
       type hw
       card 0
       device 2
}
After adding that mplayer could play sound excellently, however, speaker-test would give this error:
Channels count (1) not available for playbacks: Invalid argument
Setting of hwparams failed: Invalid argument


There's nothing obviously wrong in dmesg or any other log file. 
The volume is all the way up for everything. 
I am definitely in the audio group.
Feel free to see my discussion in the genoo forum at http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-704854-highlight-.html if I've left anything out of here.

Reproducible: Always

I suspect this is a configuration problem rather than an actual bug, but you are in good hands with beandog on the forum -- he is one of the alsa devs. If he (or another alsa dev) determines it is a config problem, he'll probably close this bug as "invalid". Don't be alarmed, it just means the forum thread is the right place to continue troubleshooting.
