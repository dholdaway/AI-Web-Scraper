It looks like a similar issue you've encountered in bug 549928. Could you try reemerging Python?

Is there a way to fix something so that I don't have to remerge python?

This still shouldn't have happened in the first place.

Something likely messed up the modification times on the related py files. It's hard to know what may have done this.
