Description

I have recently recompiled some of the packages on my machine (as several of them were outdated, like protobuf) and ended up with a non-functional kmail due to akonadi. I might have done something wrong, but honestly cannot find a legitimate reason. 

As of now I have tried to remove all akonadi-related files and folders:
~/.config/akonadi*
~/.local/share/akonadi*
and restarted akonadi
(tried the above steps a few times)

but when I create a new kmail account (IMAP), it starts to retrieve data from it and then crashes with the following log:

...
org.kde.akonadi.ETM: was collection fetch job: collections: 7
org.kde.akonadi.ETM: first fetched collection: "Search"
org.kde.akonadi.ETM: Fetch job took  0 msec

sock_file=/var/run/user/1000/kdeinit5__0

...

the key issue seems to be mentioned in this line:

  what():  Akonadi::PayloadException: Wrong payload type (requested: sp(0)<QByteArray>; present: sp(2)<KMime::Message*>

but here I have exhausted my knowledge to fix it...
my packages versions are as follows:
akonadi, akonadi-search, kmail: 16.12
kde-framework: 5.29
plasma5: 5.8.3
xapian: 1.4.1 (but tried 1.4.2 as well)

All related packages compiled from gentoo repository

If any more data or tests are required, I'm happy to comply.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start kmail
2. Add imap acount (if already present skip step 2 :) )
3. Akonadi crashes after starting to retrieve e-mails

I suggest to collect more details on our support channels. 
https://www.gentoo.org/support/

Could you attach the complete set of log files and emerge --info, please?

Well I managed to fix it, but unfortunately can't point out the exact reason.
I did a full recompile of all the installed packages (over 1300, took over a day). Now everything seems to work again.

So I guess some order of package install/compilation didn't work for me, but its impossible to find out which. Of course I also did the revdep check/rebuild before reporting this issue.
