I write a note using knotes, then I quit my session using the K menu -> logout.
When I restart KDE and knotes, My note is duplicated in 4 notes.

I'm using KDE 3.5.0

Is this a problem with KDE 3.5.2 as well?

this issue still occurs with KDE 3.5.2. (KNotes 3.6)

This issue does not occurs if I create an new "virgin" user, and start KDE and Knotes with that user. My config files seems to be broken.

Testing a bit, loading and storing of notes worked fine, changing background/font color did not work, though. You'll find the necessary config and data files via

find ~/.kde/share -iname knotes*

If backing the data up, deleting the entries and recreating the notes later doesn't solve your problem, please file a bug upstream.
