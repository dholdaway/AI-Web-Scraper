scons: *** [obj/test/release/gay-fixed.o] Error 1
scons: building terminated because of errors.
 * ERROR: dev-lang/v8-3.3.10.30 failed (compile phase):
 *   (no error message)
 * 
 * Call stack:
 *     ebuild.sh, line  56:  Called src_compile
 *   environment, line 2672:  Called die
 * The specific snippet of code:
 *       escons $(use_scons readline console readline dumb) ${myconf} . || die;
 * 
 * If you need support, post the output of 'emerge --info =dev-lang/v8-3.3.10.30',
 * the complete build log and the output of 'emerge -pqv =dev-lang/v8-3.3.10.30'.
 * The complete build log is located at '/var/tmp/portage/dev-lang/v8-3.3.10.30/temp/build.log'.
 * The ebuild environment file is located at '/var/tmp/portage/dev-lang/v8-3.3.10.30/temp/environment'.
 * S: '/var/tmp/portage/dev-lang/v8-3.3.10.30/work/v8-3.3.10.30'


Expected Results:  
Successful building

I noticed that usually "escons" command ends with message "escons fails" when something goes wrong. But in my case, it fails silently. So, maybe I don't have "escons" command at all.

These kind of errors are usually due to hardware (memory?overheated?) issues.

Yeah, the "Killed" message suggests a problem with the system.
