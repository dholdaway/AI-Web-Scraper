Description

Using a brother MFC-420CN, installed for network printing per Wiki instructions here:
http://gentoo-wiki.com/Brother_MFC_420CN/Cups

This works great for cups-1.2.12.

After upgrading cups to 1.3.7 printing fails without any indication as to why.
/var/log/cups/error_log just shows a message that the document was printed successfully.

After reemerging cups-1.2.12 things worked fine without changing any config files.

I'd be happy to provide more information on request.
