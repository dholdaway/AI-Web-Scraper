Because of OpenOffice having problems with files on NFS volumes (my /home is on NFS) I disabled the environment setting SAL_ENABLE_FILE_LOCKING=1.
This setting is in /usr/lib/openoffice/program/soffice

Unfortunately this script is overwritten with every update of app-office/openoffice-bin.
Is it possible to put the file /usr/lib/openoffice/program/soffice under watch by env-update?

I am working with app-office/openoffice-bin-2.0.3
compiled for x86 stable.

Feel free to add it to CONFIG_PROTECT yourself in make.conf (you'll need >=portage-2.1.2_pre1 if you want to protect that file alone and not the whole directory), however that's definitely not what most users need nor a proper way of fixing the issue with NFS.
