After removing last postgresql slot, a few symlinks are left broken in the filesystem. At least:

/usr/include/libpq
/usr/include/postgres*

The ebuilds should handle removing them in that case to avoid unnecessary pollution.

Apparently pkg_postrm() should already take care of this through `postgresql-config update'.

I can't reproduce this. The eselect module removes all of its symlinks for me.
