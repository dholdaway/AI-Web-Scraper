Description

When merging synaptics (X11 driver for some nice touchpad features) it install synaptics_drv.so to /usr/lib/modules/input/ instead of /usr/lib/xorg/modules/input so that Xorg-7 does not find it.
After copying it to the right directory Xorg finds it and it works.

Probably a dev can solve this very fast but I may try to fix the ebuild on my own if someone wants me to.

Looks just fine with synaptics-0.14.4-r2

<snip>
                if has_version ">=x11-base/xorg-x11-7.0" || has_version ">=x11-base/xorg-server-0.99"
                then
                        exeinto /usr/$(get_libdir)/xorg/modules/input
                        doexe synaptics_drv.so
                else
                        exeinto /usr/$(get_libdir)/modules/input
                        doexe synaptics_drv.so
                fi
</snip>

Indeed, that should work.
With the stable version of synaptics (0.14.2) it does not.
Maybe the "migrating to X.org-7" guide should be updated to use ~arch x11-drivers/synaptics too.

The general idea is that mixing ~ and stable packages is bad, and throwing masked packages into that mix is even worse.

When things move from testing to stable we try to check for things like this, but when things are in testing they're only supposed to work against testing packages.
