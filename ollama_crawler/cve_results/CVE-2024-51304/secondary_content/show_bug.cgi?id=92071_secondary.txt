Description


Daniel Kasak





          2005-05-09 21:59:58 UTC
        

I have a growing number of computers ( at work, at home, at friend's places, etc ) that are all losing their nautilus icons after gnome ( 2.6 to 2.8 ) upgrades.

There is nothing wrong with icons in menus or on various panels. But the desktop icons ( Computer, Trash, Mounts ) and *everything* else in nautilus shows the same icons: an 'unknown' type icon. I'm attaching a screenshot to demonstrate.

I started a thread: http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-324427-highlight-.html and followed *all* the suggestions, but haven't been able to revive icons on any system yet.

I've tried changing themes ( the icons appear correct in the theme preview ). I've tried deleting my .gnome2 and associated files. I've tried creating new accounts and logging into gnome. I've even done an 'emerge -e gnome'.

If someone could help me diagnose exactly what the problem is, I would very much appreciate it.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Upgrade gnome from 2.6 top 2.8 ( emerge -u --deep gnome ) using the 'stable' profile.
2. etc-update
3. Reboot

Actual Results:  
All icons in nautilus are dead.

Expected Results:  
Nice icons.

Screenshot of nautilus with 'dead' icons

Here is a screenshot showing some folders, an xls file, a txt file, and maybe
some other things. No matter what type of file I encounter, the icons all look
like this.

a solution has been posted on the forums thread, did that work for you?

No.

I've tried all the solutions posted, and none worked.
However on a number of boxes ( not all ... yet ), the problem has fixed itself
after regular upgrades. Unfortunately I can't tell *which* upgrades, because
I've abandoned using gnome & nautilus on systems that exhibit this problem. I
only found out that it was fixed when I created a new user account, which
defaulted to using gnome. If you're wondering, yes I did log back into the old
account and switch back to gnome and found that the icons were now working again
... so it wasn't a problem with any particular account. It was also not a
permission problem as the icons weren't available as root either.

bet this has todo with mime-types and incomplete updates, anyway not
reproducable and no further reports.
