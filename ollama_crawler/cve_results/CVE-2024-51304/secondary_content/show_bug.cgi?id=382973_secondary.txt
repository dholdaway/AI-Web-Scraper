www-client/firefox ebuild download the language pack to fr.xpi although it should be named firefox-6.0.2-fr.xpi

Maybe a mv fr.xpi ${P}-fr.xpi in the distfiles should suffice (or what fits into best practice).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set LINGUAS="fr"
2. Emerge www-client/firefox

Actual Results:  
Ebuild downloading fails.

Expected Results:  
Firefox compilation and installation.

I have double checked it twice and all is fine, supply your emerge --info and the relevant parts of the fetch log if your problem persists.
