I have always used gentoo-sources.  I recently decided to update from 2.6.32 to a 2.6.36 kernel (it has been a long time).  While attempting to configure the new kernal, I note that Device Drivers > Hardware Monitoring Support was missing all the sensors that I use and were formerly available in the 2.6.32 kernel.  I switched to the vanilla sources and all the devices were still available.

One such missing device was the k8temp monitor, surely the k8 AMD stuff is not obsolete (the k10 sensor does not work).  In addition, several Windbond types (I use) are gone in the gentoo-sources.

Why should any hardware monitoring sensors be removed in the gentoo-sources?  These are user selected based on hardware, not optimizations or security issues.   

Reproducible: Didn't try

Actual Results:  
Options unavailable in gentoo-kernel; temperature features on my desktop fail.

Expected Results:  
Used vanilla sources successfully.

Seems it's still there, see drivers/hwmon/Kconfig.
Perhaps you need to set an option it depends on ?

k8temp is definitely still in the kernel. If you cannot find a particular option, press / in menuconfig to search for it. Ensure that its listed dependencies are enabled.

Joy.  You are correct.  What I see is that this is called "(NEW)" even though k8temp has been in all the previous kernels.  I did not enable the development and incomplete code/driver options (yes, I am conservative) so k8temp and the missing Windbond stuff were not shown!  My bad, but happy to go back to gentoo-sources.  Also, thanks for the "/" advice which allowed me to track it down.

Again, thanks for your time.
