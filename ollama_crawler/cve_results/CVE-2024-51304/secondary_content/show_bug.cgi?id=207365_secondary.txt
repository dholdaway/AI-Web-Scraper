I installed soundkonverter with the amarok use flag, when I run it from the tools menu in amarok I get an error: "qt ruby bindings are required for this script".
Maybe the qtruby package should be pulled in when the amarok use flag is enabled?

Reproducible: Always

pkg_postinst() {
        elog "The audio USE flags are for your convience, but are not required."
        elog "For AmaroK users there is a script included with this package."
        elog "You can enable it with the Script Manager tool in Amarok, after"
        elog "installing kde-base/qtruby."
