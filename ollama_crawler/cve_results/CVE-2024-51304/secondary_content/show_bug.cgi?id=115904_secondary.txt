Description

Last week (after complete "emerge world") my machine began to freeze during X startup on NVidia logo (the last message in Xorg.0.log in those cases is: 
(**) Option "Device" "/dev/input/mice"
so probably it is a problem in drivers or drivers conflict (I use synaptics-0.14.4-r2 driver) or else.
This occurs non-deterministically, so it is hard to reproduce it (more statistics probably neccessary), mostly after starting of the laptop and the very first startx (my subsequent restartings of X are usually sucessful), although I've got this freezing 5th time last week and once I've got the freeze 3 times repeatedly.
Memory, usb mouse and other hardware is OK (before "emerge world" and on another OS everything was ok) 

My xorg.conf and configuration can be seen in:

Try some of the following:

- disabling composite
- trying the 'nv' driver
- trying the standard mouse driver instead of the synaptics one
- turning off nvidia's RenderAccel

Also, have you changed your CFLAGS recently? Just "-O2" seems overly minimalistic...

Finally, what X version are you using?

> - disabling composite
I have composite commented so the phnomenon was occuring with composite disabled  

> - trying the 'nv' driver

I tried with s/nvidia/nv, no drm and commented synaptics but
unfortunately as I've said - it is hard to reproduce the problem - a big statistics is necessary to understand whether it never occurs with the suggested changes. Since I need glx, synaptics (sometimes I have no mouse - only the pad) - I have to switch nvidia/synaptics back.

I use x86_64 almost a year and "-02" was considered to be safe enough for amd64.
What you will suggest for today?

xorg-x11-6.8.2-r6

Well, personally I'd add a -march=k8 there.

When it freezes, do you know if you have SSH access still?

And try disabling the nVidia logo, just in case that's somehow causing it (though that's a long shot).

ok, thanks

disabled. 
I'll keep an eye open on it.

thanks again

I havn't seen freezing since then (using nvidia, no logo), so I'm closing the bug (although I do not have much of statistics for that machine - starting X there rarely)

Thanks for your help!

regards
