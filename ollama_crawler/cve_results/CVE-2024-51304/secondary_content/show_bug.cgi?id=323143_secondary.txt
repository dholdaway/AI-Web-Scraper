webgl works in firefox 3.7a5pre on the same gentoo system. so the system support webgl.

chromium --enable-webgl --in-process-webgl --no-sandbox http://learningwebgl.com/lessons/lesson15/index.html 

chromium-bin  --enable-webgl --in-process-webgl --no-sandbox http://learningwebgl.com/lessons/lesson15/index.html 

will not enable webgl in new opened chrome window if the chromium window has been opened. 

if exit all opened chromium windows then the command works.

previous bug report for chromium-bin-9999 and chromium-9999 might be the same case.

Probably yes, let's merge both bugs. And fixing -bin is more complicated (it usually means upstream fixed it)

You may be hitting this: 
http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=21852#c30
(as the user explicitly mentions Gentoo)

Just updated to portage version 6.0.427.0, and I do see the Earth spinning

Which opengl implementation do you use? (eselect opengl) which video card?

The boxes I run chromium on all use nvidia binary driver, this may be the cause

--enable-webgl  only take effect on the very first chromium window opened .

the step is important:
===== situation webgl fails: 
1. open chromium[-bin] without webgl being enabled and let the chromium[-bin] window keep opening
2 then from term run command:
chromium[-bin] --enable-webgl --no-sandbox http://learningwebgl.com/lessons/lesson15/index.html

the opengi fails in the second window even though webgl was enabled with --enable-webgl, this is the case very likely to happen, as one usually opens the chromium without eanbling webgl, then want to try webgl from command line.

===== situation webgl works
1. close all chromium windows opened
2. chromium[-bin] --enable-webgl --no-sandbox http://learningwebgl.com/lessons/lesson15/index.html

 to try webgl, one  to close prevously opened chromium that started without webgl enabled. it's not convenient.

Oh, if so then that's how it works, really. If you're not happy with that, you'd have to wait until WebGL is enabled by default (it will be at some point, I think).

Feel free to file an enhancement bug to make it easier to set default chromium launch arguments in Gentoo.
