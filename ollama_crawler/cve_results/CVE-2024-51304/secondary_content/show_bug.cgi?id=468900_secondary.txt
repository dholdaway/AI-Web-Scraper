On the systemd-love overlay there's an openrc-settingsd ebuild that supports eselect-settingsd.
eselect-settingsd makes possible to switch the settingsd implementation at runtime. The currently supported settingsd implementations are: openrc-settingsd, systemd.
This makes possible to have both openrc and systemd coexist on the same system.

Reproducible: Always

Since we will finally not allow openrc+logind, I guess this is no longer required

No, I think that this is required, the blocker is silly, fix the openrc-settingsd implementation I'd say.

But, I don't see any usecase needing to have systemd and openrc-settingsd at the same time :/

I think this module is not relevant any longer because gnome 3.8 is not
going to run with OpenRc on gentoo.

I don't understand what this bug is about :/

There is no blocker. If you have systemd installed, you should have enabled the systemd USE flag globally. And when you emerge openrc-settingsd-1.0.1 with USE=systemd, it already doesn't block sys-apps/systemd - the downside is that to avoid file collision with systemd, openrc-settingsd has to avoid installing dbus service files and therefore becomes no longer dbus-activatable. (Short of adding an eselect module to dynamically rewrite the dbus service files, which apparently we've decided to not do, there is no real way to fix that.)
