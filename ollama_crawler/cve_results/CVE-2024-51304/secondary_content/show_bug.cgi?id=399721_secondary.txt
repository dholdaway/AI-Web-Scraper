Description

When starting to use PulseAudio on a KDE system, the following steps should be enough:
- set USE="pulseaudio"
- rebuild affected package with --newuse
- restart KDE
This doesn't work (busy sound device), as knotify4 still doesn't make use of PulseAudio and needs to be rebuilt manually to work.

After rebuilding kde-base/knotify manually and restarting KDE, everything works as expected.

It turns out, kde-base/knotify (no 'pulseaudio' USE flag) has automagic dependencies on media-sound/pulseaudio.

elias@moria ~ % ldd /usr/bin/knotify4|ack -i pulse
        libpulse.so.0 => /usr/lib64/libpulse.so.0 (0x00007f19f64fd000)
        libpulse-mainloop-glib.so.0 => /usr/lib64/libpulse-mainloop-glib.so.0 (0x00007f19f62f8000)
        libpulsecommon-1.1.so => /usr/lib64/libpulsecommon-1.1.so (0x00007f19f3787000)

Thanks to 'soa2ii' for investigating and reporting this issue.

Knotify doesn't depend on pulseaudio.

Remember that ldd lists dependencies of dependencies - what are you seeing in your ldd output is inherited from libphonon.
