What: ipmitool set username root causes segfault.

Starting program: /usr/sbin/ipmitool set username root
warning: Could not load shared library symbols for linux-vdso.so.1.
Do you need "set solib-search-path" or "set sysroot"?

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00007ffff715e9fa in _IO_vfprintf_internal (s=<optimized out>, format=<optimized out>, format@entry=0x4536bf "Set session username to %s\n", ap=ap@entry=0x7fffffffd778) at vfprintf.c:1642
1642    vfprintf.c: No such file or directory.


Additional info: Observed with sys-apps/ipmitool-1.8.11-r1, also verified for 1.8.12 which is not packaged yet.
