wifi-radar won't start, I just get a message about list not having a split attribute. 

Python problem?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.sudo wifi-radar
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/sbin/wifi-radar", line 1578, in ?
    auto_profile_order = auto_profile_order.split( ',' )
AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'split'


Expected Results:  
wifi-radar will start

$   emerge -pv python pygtk wifi-radar

These are the packages that would be merged, in order:

I cannot reproduce your issue: could you try rebuilding python, pygtk and wifi-radar (in this order) and see if it solves your issue?

Worked fine for me as well.  Thought I'd add this here, its just a minor edit.  The portage compile note states the wifi-radar.conf is in /etc/ but this won't be created until after wifi-radar is run.

Long time, no feedback. Closing.

You need to delete your empty /etc/wifi-radar.conf
