Aug 31 11:26:49 notorcomp udevd[7686]: lookup_user: specified user unknown 'tss'
Aug 31 11:26:49 notorcomp udevd[7686]: lookup_group: specified group unknown 'tss'
</snip>

This rule really starts to get annoying, besides breaking boot w/ ldap it now spams syslog even without any ldap used. :(

Bleh, looks like udev refused to notice the updated rules until reboot for some weird reason. Works now, closing.
