Description

I have shut down all other applications,that were started on startup, and am just using 
xastir,as compiled from the ebuild ie: no extras,as user I can setup xastir,but it does not respond to
activating  the tnc. So not really usable in this mode, as root the tnc is activated and trx's
but on doing so all available screens are unusable. I can restart Xdm & screens are ok
but as soon as the tnc trx's same problem, I was previously using a baycom modem
but the problem is the same with that. This problem has only risen since updating to KDE4.6

I have since installed Gentoo onto my PIII laptop,which doesn't have any serial ports,using the usb>serial adapters,xastir runs quite normally as root, & screens are normal.I have yet to hook up the gps to see if that make any difference,but dont expect that it will as running the same setup on the AMD64,with or without the gps ,as root the screens are corrupted. I compiled xastir with gdal festival grass geotiff shapelib. on the 32 bit machine. Then recompiled xastir with the same Use flags on the AMD but there is no improvement. Running as root nada running as user no corruption but no activity shows up on the screen. I am running the tnc2 in native mode ie: with the tapr chip. As I can also run in kiss mode on this chip as I have tf29b programming installed on it as well,but thought that runing in native mode divorces using kernel ax25.   If  you think there may be a difference I can easily setup for kernel-ax25 use again.

George, as said before in bug #353935: Do not run xastir as root! I is *not* needed!

Please make sure, that your serial interface is correctly initialized and that you have the rights to use the connection. Try some terminal program (e.g. minicom or similar) to make sure you can access your tnc. If that does not work make sure you are in the 'uucp' group as that is needed to access the serial lines. If not add yourself with 'gpasswd -a <yourusername> uucp', log out and back in and check again. 

If that is done you should be able to use your tnc from normal user account. For kernel-ax25 interfaces use 'net2kiss' and connect to the pseudo-tty.

Ok Thomas ,got that and have installed minicom,checked that the ports are right,changed the config in xastir to suit, the system appeared to be running ok till I decided to check the map usage,as I was wanting to use the osm maps, when I clicked on the apply button the screen went all wonky again!!!!!. As the modem is not in front of me I wasn't able to confirm if it trx'd at that time. Have restarted X and will restart xastir and see what transpires, more to come I guess.

Have relocated the tnc and can confirm that the act of trx'ing creates the corruption, but not all the time 3 times start xastir trx's ok,but later on trxing does create the problem.
Have since restarted xastir twice and both times corrupted at startup.
If you have any ideas on this or what you need for info to nail the problem let me know.   Geoff

I can state that my 32bit system does not have this problem. It has now been running for 2 days without a hitch. Same radio/tnc setup as on the 64 bit machine.No errors or crashes.
So we can eliminate 32bit machines.

64 bit update.... recompiled the kernel without kvm,as my processor does not have the SVM flag,article in LXF140(Linux Format) stated that processors without this AMD flag wont run kvm similarly Intel Flags are VT, for any unfortunate to have come across this problem. Have forced a trx and screens remained normal,and am waiting to see if it remains so.

I have set up my x86 machine with a new hdd,and can say the problem is not evident under xfce xastir runs quite normally. Not able to test it under kde-4.6.1 as I'm not able to get past the login screen,well it accepts my login but gets to the world icon then dumps me back to login,under kde. The Xorg log and .xsession errors are not really helpful in this case as it only logs up to a point then shuts down kde.

Closing the bug, as nobody else seems to confirm the problems.

If still not working, please reopen or contact me by my dev-mail.

The problem ??? what ever it was caused by has been cleared up in later updates.
So I guess that closing is feasable.
Thanks for your time   Geoff
