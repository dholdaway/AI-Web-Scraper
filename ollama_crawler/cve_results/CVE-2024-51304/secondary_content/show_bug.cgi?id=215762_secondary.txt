Description

games-action/extreme-tuxracer-4.0 renders all menu texts merely one pixel tall, making it illegible and the games (almost) unplayable.

The same bug seems to have been fixed in Ubuntu (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mesa/+bug/99158).
So how can we replicate this fix in gentoo linux?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. # emerge extreme-tuxracer
2. # etracer
3. observe screen

Actual Results:  
Menu (three lines of yellow text) is displayed only as three single pixel row, illegibly. Same effect is seen on all text in the game.

Expected Results:  
Legible, yellow text should be displayed.

Dell Latitude D600, xorg-x11-7.2 with radeon driver,
same problem occurs with games-arcade/ppracer-0.3.1,
link given in description (to corrsponding ubuntoo bug)
suggests that the actual culprit might be some kind of GL library, not this game.

seems like a driver bug.

a) you have wrongly configured your ga in xorg.conf
there is no EAX its EXA :]
b) this is really driver related, try to update your driver onto testing 6.8.0
c) try not to use xinerama but xrandr extension (try search gentoo-wiki on this)

(In reply to comment #3)

Thanks for the help!

> a) you have wrongly configured your ga in xorg.conf

a) and b) (now using x11-drivers/xf86-video-ati-6.8.0) have not changed anything.

> c) try not to use xinerama but xrandr extension (try search gentoo-wiki on
> this)

I'll try c) as soon as I've figured out how to change xorg.conf to enable xrandr . Would it help to try with a single monitor setup instead for now, if the main idea is just to disable xinerama?

Also on my todo list is switching to ati-drivers to see if the bug occurs there, too.

BTW, I do remember that a (very) early version of tuxracer (long before it even became ppracer) worked, but already later versions did not. It is possible that this concurred with me switching from ati-drivers to the open source ones, or maybe to modular X, but I am not sure.

mhm,
i guess you have old mesa (not really old in terms of gentoo [its stable]) try using ~x86 mesa and mesa-progs

do not mess with both gl implementations, it could break some stuff in your system (ie qt bindings) so for testing ok but long term use don't keep both ati-drivers and xf86-drivers-ati on your gentoo.

Using Mesa 7.0.2 fixes this bug (even without having reemerged xorg-server without  nptl use flags, as mesa-progs advises to do), or at least it does in this combination:

media-libs/mesa-7.0.2               (~x86)
x11-apps/mesa-progs-7.0.1           (~x86)
xorg-x11-7.2
xorg-server-1.3.0.0-rc5
x11-drivers/xf86-video-ati-6.8.0    (~x86)

So with this, I've changed this bug's status to "worksforme".

Thanks also for warning me against keeping both drivers around -- apparently, I had, and did occasionally experience a need to recompile qt libraries and dependent packages. So hopefully I can avoid that in the future ;-)

I just noticed the most embarrassing typo:

I meant to report this bug for version 0.4, not the (not as of yet existing) version 4.0 of extreme-tuxracer; the first word in my bug report should have been:

games-action/extreme-tuxracer-0.4
