Description

I expect /etc/java-config-2/current-system-vm to point to the current system VM.

In particular, I'd like the benefits of java-config-2 to update my firefox plugin.
I have made a simlink as follow 
ln -s /etc/java-config-2/current-system-vm/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so /opt/firefox/plugins/

This link works if I select sun-jre-1.4, sun-jre-1.5 or sun-jre-1.6
But is I select sun-jdk-1.4, sun-jdk-1.5 or sun-jdk-1.6, the link is broke.

Indeed, if java-config-2 -S is called with a JRE, the jre is in /etc/java-config-2/current-system-vm.
Whereas if java-config-2 -S is called with a JDK, the jre is in /etc/java-config-2/current-system-vm/jre



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. ln -s /etc/java-config-2/current-system-vm/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so /opt/firefox/plugins/
2. eselect -S sun-jre-1.5
3. ls -al /opt/firefox/plugins/ # link OK
4. eselect -S sun-jdk-1.5
5. ls -al /opt/firefox/plugins/ # link broken


Expected Results:  
I think the jre should always be in current-system-vm/jre, should a symlink be created for that to happen.

We have eselect java-nsplugin in place for this.
