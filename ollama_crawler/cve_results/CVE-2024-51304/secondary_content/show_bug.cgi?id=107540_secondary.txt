In new version handbook, the section 6.e Upgrading baselayout is missing. I have
problem with my eth0 loading for booting after I install the base system with
stage 1 compiled by gcc 3.4.4. It says "eth0 does not exist". After I followed
the steps in the section 6.e "Upgrading baselayout" in the old version of
handbook, with the following two lines, the problem is gone. 

#rm /etc/conf.d/net
#CONFIG_PROTECT="-*" emerge baselayout

Note: In fact, although the baselayout for 2005.1 stage 1 is the newest, but
re-emerge it will fix the problem that I mentined above.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.

This is a really bad idea(tm)... 

And instructions for upgrading your network configuration are diplayed by
baselayout ebuild.

is this simply the bug where the symlinks in /etc/runlevels/*/ were pointing to
files in /tmp/stage1root/ ?

Not at all.
This was the right way(tm) to install Gentoo 2005.0 from stage3 after the new
baselayout had gone stable.
It should not be required with 2005.1

Agreed. This isn't needed here.
