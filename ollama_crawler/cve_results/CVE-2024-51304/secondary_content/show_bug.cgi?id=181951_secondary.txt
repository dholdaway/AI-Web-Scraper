Description

ksysguard currently only supports the zeroconf USE flag:

DEPEND="lm_sensors? ( sys-apps/lm_sensors )
    zeroconf? ( net-misc/mDNSResponder )"

It should alternatively support avahi and require that avahi is built with the
mdnsresponder-compat USE flag. See kdelibs or ntp for example.

NB: mDNSResponser (zeroconf) and avahi are mutually exclusive.


Reproducible: Always

The flag is already gone in 3.5.7.
