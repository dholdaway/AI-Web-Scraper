Clicking on download links for minimal install CD and stage3 for amd64 leads to 404 pages:

http://distfiles.gentoo.org/releases/amd64/autobuilds/20160616/install-amd64-minimal-20160616.iso

http://distfiles.gentoo.org/releases/amd64/autobuilds/20160616/stage3-amd64-20160616.tar.bz2

Latest available on the distfiles.gentoo.org is 20160609. Please fix! :)

Reproducible: Always

Links seem to work just fine for me.

If this happens again, we'd need the IP address of the server you hit from the distfiles.g.o DNS round-robin.
