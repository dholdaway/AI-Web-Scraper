The kvm-intel module will not load with the latest stable kernel (2.6.27-r7) with "operation not permitted" and "disabled in bios."  This usually indicates that the VT extensions are dnot enabled in the bios setup, but it is enabled.  It works as it should in previous kernels and in the latest 2.6.28 version.

Reproducible: Always

Hm, that is odd. Assigning to maintainers.

I always get:

root@thinkpad> modprobe kvm-intel
FATAL: Error inserting kvm_intel (/lib/modules/2.6.28-gentoo-r1/kernel/arch/x86/kvm/kvm-intel.ko): Operation not supported

The kvm module loads fine, though, but I don't get a /dev/kvm device.

Ah, I was a bit too fast.  dmesg told me that kvm was disabled in the BIOS.  I enabled Intel VT before, but in order to make it work a system halt (no reboot) was needed.

Now it works as expected.

We hit this on one of our boxes at work.  Combinations of disabling and enabling VT and VT-d in the kernel eventually made it work again.

Closing.
