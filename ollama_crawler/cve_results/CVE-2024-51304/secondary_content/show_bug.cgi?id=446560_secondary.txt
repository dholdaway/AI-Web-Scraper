Description


Richard Yao (RETIRED)






          2012-12-09 02:07:39 UTC
        

I spotted the following when running tail:

tail: unrecognized file system type 0x2fc12fc1 for ‘test’. please report this to bug-coreutils@gnu.org. reverting to polling

There is an upstream patch for this issue:

http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=coreutils.git;a=commit;h=97b786a33d54ea6621e2cb9c48d56b7190a1eaf7

The fix is in coreutils 8.20. This is a minor annoyance, but I thought I would file a bug about it so that base system is aware.
