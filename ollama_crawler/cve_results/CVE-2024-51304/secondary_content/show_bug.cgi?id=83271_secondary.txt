I can't boot the last 2005.0 rc5 liveCD: it's missing the driver for tekram DC395 SCSI host controller. Can it be built in the kernel?

During the boot why isn't it checked the /newroot/dev/sr1?

Boot with "doscsi" as the instructions tell you to do for SCSI CDROM... The driver is there as a module.

Also, we don't take bugs against pre-release materials other than the single pre-release bug, as it is impossible for you to know what we've changed locally without making a new pre-release.

Sorry for posting this bug for a pre-release but otherwise I'd have to wait for the 2005.1 liveCD :-)

I have booted with the doscsi option: it doesn't boot. In the list of modules being loaded there is not my SCSI controller. I get

...
Attempting to mount CD:- /newroot/dev/cdroms/*
Attempting to mount CD:- /newroot/dev/ide/cd/*
Attempting to mount CD:- /newroot/dev/sr0

and the boot process ends without success (root directory not found). My CDROM however is mapped on /dev/sr1 (and this one is not checked).

If this problem has been solved after the 2005.0 rc5 ignore this post!

Thanks for your attention (and your time)!

If sr0 has a CD in it, that will cause this problem... put the disk in your first cdrom

My first CDROM is /dev/sr0 but it is an old CD writer which doesn't read CDRW. I have to use /dev/sr1 for this reason.

I have solved this problem using the option cdboot=/dev/sr1 on boot: the real problem is that there are no modules for the SCSI host controller. Infact after entering in the busy box, if I list /lib/modules/2.6.10-gentoo-r6/kernel/driver/scsi/, I doesn't find the module dc*.ko for my host controller (infact there are no /dev/sr* devices).

The config entry for my SCSI host controller is CONFIG_SCSI_DC395x.

Created attachment 52295 [details]
kernel_log.txt

This is the log of kernel messages when I boot the liveCD: no SCSI card
recognized :-(
