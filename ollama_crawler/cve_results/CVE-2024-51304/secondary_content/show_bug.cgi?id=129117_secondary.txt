Right now bitstream-vera fonts haven't support for ISO8859-2 national fonts, these are supported by dejavu font.
Therefore xorg should be dependent on dejavu xor vera fonts,
maybe selection can be done by use flag or whatever else.

Bitstream was added as a replacement for the TTF Luxi fonts, which were bad renditions of the Type1 versions. It was not meant to cover all possible available charsets, you can install fonts for those seperately as you probably did before.

Now, why not dejavu ? http://www.advogato.org/person/roozbeh/diary.html?start=104 has an in-depth explanation.

foser: That doesn't change that bitstream-vera doesn't support the language and also you should have read the bug to the end.

OOo and Qt 4 seem not to have the problem and according to the dejavu wiki

>The current version is 2.4.1, which is an intermediate release to fix the kerning bug with Pango

the problem should be solved. Changing the dependency to

|| ( bitstream dejavu ) 

would be sensible.

You haven't read my comment and the upstream bug. It is just about providing a basic ttf font, not a font that covers every charset out there.

Also the 'kerning bug with pango' was a very obvious bug in dejavu 2.4.0, 2.4.1 fixes that one, but not the inherent kerning problems in dejavu itself.

I have read it very well. For those needing a charset, not provided by vera, dejavu would - despite the kerning problems - be the better choice. Anyone who does not explicitly choose dejavu, would still get vera.

It's merely a matter that you don't want it as dependency in the ebuild, than your problem if someone chooses to use it.

Users of other charsets needed to install additional fonts as it was, so nothing changes in that respect. The move to install vera by default has nothing todo with providing a default charset for any subset of all languages, dejavu doesn't provide that either and for the portion it does provide, it does so in questionable ways.

Basically what you are requesting is a big || statement for all fonts in the tree.

No. An alternative close to vera does not mean all fonts.

Maybe I try to express my opinion, maybe it can be helpfull.


As far as I know, Dejavu fonts, are clone of bitstream vera with addition of some other codepages than standard. So if user decide to use this font, why install vera fonts (that if installed are claimed to be deault font for all qt/gtk). In that case all national characters from 8859-2 are displayed as shrubbery on the screen.

OK
If you cannot/dont like to xor dejavu fonts vit vera dependency,
then please remove the dependency of vera fonts from xorg, or make it at least conditional.
I don't like this font in my system, because when it is installed, all applications try to use it by default, and this makes displayed texts shity.

Tough, it's not changing. Feel free to use an overlay or set up your fontconfig to ignore it.

Since last year many thing changed.
Maybe now it would be good time to change the dependency of default font for xorg.

Yeah, maybe.

Can anybody take a look on this? I am using package.provided for not getting bitstream-vera-fonts installed and would be nice not needing to do it :-)

Thanks a lot

Why not create a virtual package which depends on a number of possible fonts? xorg doesn't _really_ depend on any particular font (afaik, at least not bistream..), it just needs *some* font which can render and be a default - preferably one with characters in your current character set.

So anyway, my proposal is to make virtual packages for certain font groups. You'd probably want a virtual/default-font-latin1, virtual/default-font-latin2, virtual/default-font-japanese, etc.

This would also make it easier for people who need, say, a Japanese font to be installed. When I needed that a couple weeks ago I had to go off to Google to find an appropriate font.

Any news on this?

fontconfig as of 2.7.0 now uses dejavu over ttf-bitstream-vera when both are available and xorg-x11 as of 7.4 doesn't have a dependency on either, so.. fixed.
