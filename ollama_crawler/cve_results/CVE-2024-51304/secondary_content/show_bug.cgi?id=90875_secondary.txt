sounds like the rsync failed to set the /usr/portage/eclass. try to emerge sync again.

emerge info

and ls /usr/portage/eclass

contents of /etc/make.conf.

Anything else you may think is wrong. Consider joining irc and asking in #gentoo.

There is very little here to determine whats wrong.

I'm hoping you've worked this out or got help on irc. I can't work it out from 
the information you've given me.
