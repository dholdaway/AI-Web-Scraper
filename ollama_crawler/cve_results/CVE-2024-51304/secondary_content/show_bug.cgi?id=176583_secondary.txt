If you use sudo eselect kernel set <x>; it doesn't report an error but fails to set your kernel.

You can only change your kernel using eselect if your root. sudo'ing doesn't work, it should return an error

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.eselect kernel list
2.observe which kernel is selected
3.sudo eselect kernel set <x> (Where x is not the kernel which was previously selected).
4.eselect kernel list (Observe that selected kernel has not changed, but no error message was recived)



Expected Results:  
Change in selected kernel, error message
