Description

Hi there.

We are currently using gentoo for our websites and we have to enable the php safe mode.
We use Smarty as a std package but when safe mode is On, we can't access to the files.
The ebuild should use one of the following solutions
1 - Files from smarty package should be owned by root:apache. (don't set apache:apache for security reasons). Then when safe mode is enabled, we can turn on safe_mode_gid.
2 - The second solution is to install smarty like phpmyadmin or something else with the 'vhosts' USE flag.

All comments, ideas are welcome.

Thank you :-)

Well,

After some research with one of my developper, one of the workaround to this is to use "safe_mode_include_dir". Could it be possible to include a message in the ebuild telling this :)

Thank you :)

Uhm, really - read the php docs on safe mode. There's no permissions problem here. We won't be adding messages, since this is not a smarty-specific issue.
