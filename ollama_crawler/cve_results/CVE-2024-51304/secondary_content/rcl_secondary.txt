These results were better than the company's guidance due to stronger close-in demand. The strength is continuing into 2024 with Adjusted EPS expected to be in the range of $9.50 to $9.70 per share. "2023 was an exceptional year, propelled by unmatched demand for our brands from new and loyal guests," said Jason Liberty, president and CEO, Royal Caribbean Group. "With the wind in our sails and record-breaking bookings, 2024 is poised to be another robust year, and we expect to achieve two of our Trifecta goals one year early," added Liberty. "With our industry-leading global brands combined with the most innovative fleet and destinations, we remain intensely focused on delivering a lifetime of vacations and priceless memories for our guests while delivering exceptional long-term shareholder value."Full Year 2023 Results: •Gross Margin Yields increased 13.2% as-reported. Net Yields increased 13.5% in Constant Currency (13.2% as-reported).  Both metrics are compared to 2019. •Gross Cruise Costs per Available Passenger Cruise Day ("APCD") increased 10.9% as-reported. Net Cruise Costs ("NCC"), excluding Fuel, per APCD increased 7.9% in Constant Currency (7.5% as-reported). Both metrics are compared to 2019, and include approximately 65 bps, compared to prior guidance, related to increase in stock compensation expense due to the significant rise in share price.Page 1The following information was filed by Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL) on Thursday, February 1, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.

 Inside Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Expense   Highlight
However, should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimates of ship useful lives or projected residual values, depreciation expense could be materially higher or lower.



 Financial - Debt   Highlight
Our export credit facilities and our non-export credit facilities, and certain of our credit card processing agreements contain covenants that require us, among other things, to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio, limit our net debt-to-capital ratio, and maintain a minimum liquidity, and under certain facilities, to maintain a minimum level of shareholders' equity.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Certain of our accounting policies are deemed "critical," as they require management's highest degree of judgment, estimates and assumptions.

 Other - Other   Highlight
We adjust the valuation of our derivative financial instruments to incorporate credit risk.

 Other - Other   Highlight
As of December 31, 2023, other than the items described above, we are not party to any other off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interest, certain derivative instruments and variable interest entities, that either have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial position.
