Description

I am feeling an extrange experience, I have amarok with mysql with aprox 5 weeks of music in the collection.

When I load all the collection it takes some time with amarok not responding, but other qt apps does not respond either in this time [kopete, konqueror, etc..] a issue of qt or some gentoo problem?

Thanks (I'll attach emerge --info)

Reproducible: Always

I can't recreate.  Probably just a fluke.
