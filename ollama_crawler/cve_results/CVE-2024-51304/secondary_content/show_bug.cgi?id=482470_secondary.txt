dev-util/anjuta-3.8.4 keyworded ~x86 on an older x86 install with some ~ seems to work fine.

On a 10 month old amd64 system this version came in on Aug 23rd, marked stable at the time.

The amd64 system is running Gnome2 desktop environment and the Places->Home menu shortcut runs anjuta instead, Places->Desktop does a complete panel disappearing act and other strangeness.  I stopped there.

https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=163172 mentions something very similar.

Downgrading to dev-util/anjuta-3.6.2-r1 resolves the issue.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.emerge dev-util/anjuta-3.8.4
2.use gnome2 Places menu
3.
Actual Results:  
anjuta is ran (instead of nautilius I presume), or loss of panels/desktop.

Expected Results:  
display home/desktop folders in nautilus.

That was a temporal error that was fixed by Patrick some hours later, all should be ok now (not mixing them)

I'm not sure I understood you.  You meant the keyword changes?  I only mentioned that at all because it's non ~amd64 keyworded status snuck in prior (so at the time of my sync on the 23rd it showed both versions keyworded amd64).  The other system (x86) I actively keyword accepted it back in June and for whatever reasons works fine.

The keywording is irrelevant as eventually 3.6.2-r1 will likely be removed with 3.8.4 pushed stable and this bug will come right back, hence this report.  After a current sync, the problem remains unresolved as nothing has changed since the keyword removal on the 23rd.

This is my takeaway with 3.6.2-r1 mimeinfo.cache/anjuta.desktop files copied to /tmp and 3.8.4 re-installed as of today:

$ diff /tmp/mimeinfo.cache /usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache 
100a101
> application/x-anjuta-project-template=anjuta.desktop;
324c325
< inode/directory=nautilus-folder-handler.desktop;
---
> inode/directory=anjuta.desktop;nautilus-folder-handler.desktop;

$ diff /tmp/anjuta.desktop /usr/share/applications/anjuta.desktop
[..trimmed...]
< MimeType=application/x-anjuta;
---
> MimeType=application/x-anjuta;application/x-anjuta-project-template;x-anjuta-compressed-project-template;inode/directory;


Here's the upstream report from 3 months ago, https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=699456.  Upstream is blaming gnome shell when the underlying causes are the changes they made shown above.  Resolution seems to be left to the end user.

You point in summary that this messes Gnome2 associations, but anjuta-3.8 will go with Gnome 3.8 and, then, this needs to be checked with Gnome 3.8 (with its defaults.list file that defaults to nautilus for inode/directory
