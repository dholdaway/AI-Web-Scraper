Binary redistribution of faad2 requires a patent license.

Reproducible: Always

AAUI, we cannot impose any such additional restrictions on software that is distributed under the GPL. Clause 7 of the GPL-2 (aka the "liberty or death" clause) forbids this. So the only option would be not to distribute the package at all.

However, since all the major distros (Debian, Redhat, openSuSE, Arch) carry faad2, I don't see any need for action here.

Disclaimer: IANAL, TINLA.

+1

We have plenty of such issues: x264/x265/ffmpeg/libav probably use patents handled by MPEG-LA, and it is up to those who make commercial usage of it to make sure they payed the fees.

Is this not covered by adding the right license like mpeg2enc and MPEG-4 to the LICENSE variable?

No. According to upstream, faad2 is distributed under GPL version 2 or later, so the LICENSE variable is correct.

However, see comment #1 for the consequences of this.
