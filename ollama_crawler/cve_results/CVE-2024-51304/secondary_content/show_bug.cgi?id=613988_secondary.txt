Happens with the live ebuild as well. I'm not sure why this happens as www-client/otter doesn't use leveldb directly.

Try rebuilding leveldb and failing that qtwebkit.

If that fixes it, then the problem is that this could have been done automatically.

Did you try?

Not necessarily. We've seen similar issues with leveldb caused by the gcc-5 upgrade. If that's the case, we can't do anything about it, read your news items.

OTOH, if this is caused by a leveldb upgrade (unlikely since there haven't been new versions in the past couple of years), then please reassign to leveldb maintainers to add a subslot so that qtwebkit can properly depend on it.

Just FYI, re-emerging leveldb fixed this for me.
