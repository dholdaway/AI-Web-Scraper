In current plasma, the task manager widget does not work as expected.

When the "Show tooltips" option is set, it displays iconized preview images of the program windows of the relevant program group. Until recently, clicking on an image opened (raised) the according program window.

Currently, this is broken. Instead of the selected program, a random member of the program group represented by the task manager item seems to be chosen and that window raised.
If there is no group (ie. there is only one preview image/running program), no window at all is raised.

Sorry for the prosaic description, UI bugs without logs/package names are a bit hard to grasp ...

Reproducible: Always

The problem went away after I had booted the machine into another distro (ubuntu) and the user logged into his plasma there. After rebooting into gentoo the behaviour was as expected.
