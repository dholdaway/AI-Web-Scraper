libtool: compile: warning: libobj name `build/*_ogg.lo' may not contain shell special characters.

That's where your build diverges from mine.  I can't reproduce your build failure here though and since we're not getting more reports like this it seems like you have a local issue.

Maybe post the output from emerge -evp sdl-mixer

I can't reproduce this.  I'll mark this NEEDINFO for now.
