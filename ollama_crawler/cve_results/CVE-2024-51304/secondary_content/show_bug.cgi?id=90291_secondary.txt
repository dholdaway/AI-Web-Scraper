Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.crossdev --target sparc64-unknown-linux-gnu

Actual Results:  
A working cross-compiler was not generated due to a failure when builing a 
sparc64 targeted glibc. 

Expected Results:  
Produced a working cross-compiler. 

I was able to successfully build a working mips cross-compiler with the exact 
same configuration.

Please attatch logs as text/plain

What version of glibc is it trying to install?  I have the following:

(04:02:20 Mon Apr 25 2005 root@cid x86_64)
/mnt/raid0/gentoo/cvs/gentoo-x86 $ qpkg -I -v sparc64
cross-sparc64-unknown-linux-gnu/linux-headers-2.6.10 *
cross-sparc64-unknown-linux-gnu/gcc-3.4.3.20050110 *
cross-sparc64-unknown-linux-gnu/binutils-2.15.92.0.2-r2 *
cross-sparc64-unknown-linux-gnu/glibc-2.3.4.20050125-r1 *

As far as I understand there is not support for a 64bit userland on sparc
anyway, so I would put this bug at best as WONTFIX, or INVALID

to have a full sparc tool chain the right thing to do would be

crossdev -s3 -t sparc
crossdev -s1 -t sparc64

actually, you can have a full sparc64 toolchain... I'm closing this as it works
for me (see versions above)
