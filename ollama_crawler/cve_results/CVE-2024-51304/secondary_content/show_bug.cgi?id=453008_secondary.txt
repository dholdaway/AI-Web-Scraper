I think would be really interesting to be able to rebuild (and, then, update) live installed packages when updating my system with "emerge -avuDN world"

I have searched in bugzilla for similar reports... but I have missed one (probably because I couldn't find exact terms used in its summary/description :S)

Thanks

Reproducible: Always

Do you know that you can use @live-rebuild to rebuild them separately?

There's also app-portage/smart-live-rebuild, which detects upstream changes and rebuilds only when necessary.

Bug 182028 is about adding EAPI extensions that will allow the package manager to do what smart-live-rebuild does.

Didn't know any of that options, in that case I guess this can be closed. Sorry for the inconvenience
