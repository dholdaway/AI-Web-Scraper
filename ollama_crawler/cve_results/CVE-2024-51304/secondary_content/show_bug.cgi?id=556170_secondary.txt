Description

the RDEPEND in dev-python/astroid for dev-python/logilab-common changed in 1.3.7 from
">=dev-python/logilab-common-0.60.0[${PYTHON_USEDEP}]"
to
"<=dev-python/logilab-common-0.63.0[${PYTHON_USEDEP}]".
Considering that the versions of logilab-common available in the tree currently are 0.61.0, ~0.62.1, 0.63.2 and ~1.0.2, this causes some conflicts.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Attempt to update dev-python/astroid from 1.3.6 to 1.3.7
Actual Results:  
[ebuild     UD ] dev-python/logilab-common-0.61.0 [0.63.2]
[ebuild     U ~] dev-python/astroid-1.3.7 [1.3.6]

Expected Results:  
astroid is updated without downgrading logilab-common

That is what upstream wants. You need to downgrade dev-python/logilab-common

Next astroid release will completely drop the logilab dependency.
