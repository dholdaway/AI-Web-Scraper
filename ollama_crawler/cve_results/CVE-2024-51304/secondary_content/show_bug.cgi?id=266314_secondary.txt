When trying to emerge hedgewars, dev-lang/fpc fails to emerge.  Both the stable 2.2.0 and testing 2.2.2-r1 fail the same way.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge fpc

I cannot reproduce this on my machine. Can you attach "emerge --info", "emerge -pv dev-lang/fpc" and build.log?

emerge -1 sandbox should fix it

Thanks!

This fixed the issue for fpc 2.2.2-r1 (updating sandbox).  I assume it would also fix the issue for other versions of fpc.

Before closing the case, should the official fix be to update fpc dependencies?
