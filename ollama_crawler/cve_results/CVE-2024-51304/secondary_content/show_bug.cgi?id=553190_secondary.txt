It looks like to compile this package you need >=sys-fs/e2fsprogs-1.42.13

libarchive/archive_entry.c:59:55: fatal error: ext2fs/ext2_fs.h: No such file or directory
 #include <ext2fs/ext2_fs.h> /* for Linux file flags */

compilation terminated.
Makefile:5054: recipe for target 'libarchive/archive_entry.lo' failed
make[1]: *** [libarchive/archive_entry.lo] Error 1
make[1]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....
make[1]: Leaving directory '/tmp/portage/app-arch/libarchive-3.1.2-r1/work/libarchive-3.1.2'


Seems sys-fs/e2fsprogs-1.42.12 is stable, so any stable system cannot compile libarchive as it will fail with the above error.

~amd64 dir # equery belongs /usr/include/ext2fs/ext2_fs.h
 * Searching for /usr/include/ext2fs/ext2_fs.h ... 
sys-fs/e2fsprogs-1.42.13 (/usr/include/ext2fs/ext2_fs.h)


amd64 dir # equery belongs ext2_fs.h
 * Searching for ext2_fs.h ... 

amd64 dir # emerge -pv e2fsprogs

These are the packages that would be merged, in order:

I'm unable to reproduce this.  I just downgraded to =sys-fs/e2fsprogs{,-libs}-1.42.12 and then emerged =app-arch/libarchive-3.1.2-r1 without issue.

Feel free to reopen if you can provide additional information to help reproduce this.  Additionally, pasting the output from "emerge --info e2fsprogs{,-libs} libarchive" would be helpful.
