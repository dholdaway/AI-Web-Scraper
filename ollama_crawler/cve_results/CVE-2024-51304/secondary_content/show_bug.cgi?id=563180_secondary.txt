So far, I am seeing this only on 32-bit systems. I have been unable to reproduce on 64-bit multilib, so far.

Is your virtual/libffi the same as ours? Does it depend on dev-libs/libffi?

Just trying to rule out any toolchain differences.

Without researching the root cause, it looks like this bug was caused by some other failure on the stage, possibly a gawk failure. Closing it.
