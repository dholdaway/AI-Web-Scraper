Description

I'm not sure if it's a bug or just an expected behaviour that I don't understand. Anyway, every now and then I see the packages that have a newer non-masked versions, but "emerge -uDvN @world" doesn't pull them in. On the other hand, "emerge --depclean" doesn't clean them.
For example, at my current setup, dev-texlive/texlive-latex-2007 is installed even though 2008-r1 is available.

Do those missing packages appear if you use the --with-bdeps=y option to emerge?

emerge --with-bdeps-y -uDpv world

Yes, they are.
Just as I suspected, the behaviour I wasn't aware of. :)
Do I close the bug now?

I close it as WORKSFORME since this is documented behavior. 
Just have a look into man emerge and search for --with-bdeps

Cheers ;)
