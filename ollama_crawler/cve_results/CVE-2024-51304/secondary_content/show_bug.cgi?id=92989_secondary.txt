if i start "genlop -lt" i get different times for some packages than with 
"genlop -t <package>" 
 
Example: 
 
root@venus:~> genlop -lt | grep -A 1 openoffice 
   Tue May 17 18:29:38 2005 >>> app-office/openoffice-1.1.4-r1 
     merge time: 33 minutes and 24 seconds 
root|venus:~> genlop -t openoffice 
 * app-office/openoffice 
    
   Tue May 17 18:29:38 2005 >>> app-office/openoffice-1.1.4-r1 
     merge time: 6 hours, 6 minutes and 49 seconds 
 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.emerge something that takes a long time to compile  
2.genlop -lt | grep -A 1 <package>  
 
  


Expected Results:  
both genlop calls should produce the same merge times

request for closing this bug as there is no provided version of genlop (surely some old one) and bug has 7 months without reply from reporter.

I can't speak for the original reporter of this bug, but I am using genlop 0.30.3.  I haven't had this problem in the past (with the same version of genlop), but I am having it right now.

Example:

$ genlop -t perl
 * dev-lang/perl

     Fri Feb 20 07:56:21 2004 >>> dev-lang/perl-5.8.2-r1
       merge time: 45 minutes and 17 seconds.

     Fri Jan 21 16:49:10 2005 >>> dev-lang/perl-5.8.6-r1
       merge time: 26 minutes and 50 seconds.

     Mon Jun 27 10:17:17 2005 >>> dev-lang/perl-5.8.6-r4
       merge time: 28 minutes and 58 seconds.

     Sat Jul  9 10:58:24 2005 >>> dev-lang/perl-5.8.7
       merge time: 27 minutes and 12 seconds.

$ genlop -c
Use of uninitialized value in subtraction (-) at /usr/bin/genlop line 583, <CMDLINE> line 1.
Use of uninitialized value in subtraction (-) at /usr/bin/genlop line 584, <CMDLINE> line 1.

 * dev-lang/perl-5.8.7-r3 

       current merge time: 15 minutes and 41 seconds.
       ETA: 6 days, 8 hours, 43 minutes and 22 seconds.

Reproducible: Always(?)
Steps to Reproduce:
1.emerge something
2.genlop -t <package>
3.genlop -c

Expected Results:  genlop -c should show an ETA that is similar to those given by genlop -t <package>

Here are the two lines (583 and 584) from genlop referred to in the error messages above:

                    &gtime($e_end - $e_start);
                    $tm_secondi += ($e_end - $e_start);

they are in the subroutine current().  Hope this is of some help.
