Hi, I tried to install games-strategy/asc-2.4.0.0 and it didnt went through. It was a configure error with /usr/bin/wx-config. May I have a suggestion!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
0. Ebuild fails, because no wc config was selected. Easy workaround!!

1. /usr/bin/wx-config
An error occurred while calling wx-config:

No profile currently selected

Please use `eselect wxwidgets` to select an available profile and try again.
2. emerge games-strategy/asc fails with 

checking whether we are using the GNU C++ compiler... (cached) yes
checking whether x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-g++ accepts -g... (cached) yes
checking dependency style of x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-g++... (cached) none
checking for perl... yes
checking for working C++ compiler... yes
checking bitset usability... yes
checking bitset presence... yes
checking for bitset... yes
checking for xvid_encore in -lxvidcore... yes
checking XviD usage... checking for sdl-config... /usr/bin/sdl-config
checking for SDL - version >= 1.2.2... yes
checking for IMG_LoadJPG_RW in -lSDL_image... yes
checking for pkg-config... yes
checking for x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-pkg-config... no
checking for pkg-config... /usr/bin/pkg-config
checking pkg-config is at least version 0.9.0... yes
checking for LUA... yes
checking for jpeg_CreateDecompress in -ljpeg... yes
checking for Mix_PlayChannelTimed in -lSDL_mixer... yes
checking for Sound_Init in -lSDL_sound... yes
checking for wx-config... /usr/bin/wx-config
checking for wxWidgets version >= 2.4.0... no
configure: error: 
		wxWidgets 2.4.0 must be installed on your system.

		If you have a distribution supplied wxWidgets package installed,
		perhaps the wxWidgets-devel package is missing.

		The wxWidgets packages are sometimes also called wxGTK, if you can't
		find wxWidgets packages in your distribution, search for wxGTK

		If your distribution really does not contain the wxWidgets library,
		you can download it from www.wxwidgets.org

		If you have it installed, but it isn't working, check that wx-config is in path,
		the directory where wxWidgets libraries are installed (returned by
		'wx-config --libs' or 'wx-config --static --libs' command)
		is in LD_LIBRARY_PATH or equivalent variable and
		wxWidgets version is 2.4.0 or above.

3. eselect wxwidgets list
Available wxWidgets profiles:
  [1]   gtk2-ansi-release-2.6
  [2]   gtk2-unicode-release-2.6
  [3]   gtk2-unicode-release-2.8
localhost ... # eselect wxwidgets set 3

Setting wxWidgets profile to gtk2-unicode-release-2.8

localhost ... #

4. emerge => is fine then!!

Actual Results:  
Easy workaround. I didnt knew that wx ... was not set. Maybe its a good idea to inform user or to set a profile automatically. Only an idea. Mark this bug invalid, if you want to! I am only an user, who wants to help!

Actually, with the 2.5.0 version, I was able to build even when wx-config reports an error.
Reopen if you get the same error.
