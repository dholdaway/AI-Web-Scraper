I have the very same problem too.:
I had a very lite version of KDE 4.4 I was trying to update to KDE 4.6. When I was trying to "emerge -uDN world". this error appeared.

this is the error:

/bin/grep: /usr/lib64/libpixman-1.la: No such file or directory
/bin/sed: can't read /usr/lib64/libpixman-1.la No such file or directory
libtool: link: `/usr/lib64/libpixman-1.la` is not a valid libtool archive
.
.
.
Failed to emerge dev-libs/gobject-introspection-0.10.8.

Unfortunately I can't use KDE now. Plz fix this soon. Because I can't do my job now. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.emerge -uDN dev-libs/gobject-introspection
2.
3.

I forget to say that: "emerge pixman" works properly.

Your issue is caused by stale .la files. Try using dev-util/lafilefixer to fix them (lafilefixer --justfixit).

To help prevent similar problems in the future, you can add fixlafiles to FEATURES in your /etc/make.conf.

I can't work but I can collect information for developers. It seems this bug is not just for me. look at these threads:

http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-885330-start-0.html
http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-882113-start-0.html

Note: lafilefixer --justfixit worked for me too.

Thanks a lot Alexandre Rostovtsev.
