Description

Should these two pages with similiar functionality (add bug) be so different?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open https://bugs.gentoo.org/ in your favourite browser;
2. Open File Bug link in one tab;
3. Open Search link in another tab;
4. Type some query string on search page and make search;
5. Find add bug link on page with search result and open it.
6. Compare two add bug pages.
Actual Results:  
They are very different.
The search's one contains only one form, but dynamically updated (on summary string) search.
The basic file bug page contains Description, Steps to reproduce, Resulsts' and some other flelds.

Expected Results:  
The file bug form should not depend on link, used to open it.

Indeed the two links bring you to two different pages:

https://bugs.gentoo.org/enter_bug.cgi?format=guided (when clicking on 'File a bug')
or
https://bugs.gentoo.org/enter_bug.cgi (in the search results)

As you can see from the URLs, the latter is the default.

The link in the search results is only shown when you do a search by a product/component. I think most people search for a term, so there are probably not many users even seeing the link. And if you see it, I estimate you have enough bugzilla experience to not need the guided format.

Additionally, this would require a template change that needs forward-porting when we update bugzilla. So all in all, I don't this is worth the effort.

You can try filing this upstream at bugzilla, maybe they want to implement it; if they do, we'll apply the change of course as well. Thanks.
