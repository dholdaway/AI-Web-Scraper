 Financial - Income   Highlight
In addition to valuation allowances, we provide for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement standards prescribed by the authoritative guidance on income taxes.



 Financial - Dividend   Highlight
Our ability to pay dividends could be affected by future business performance, liquidity, capital needs, alternative investment opportunities and loan covenants.

 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
Unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased SG&A expenses by $2.1 million from period to period.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Although we decreased inventory levels throughout fiscal year 2024, decreases in inventory during fiscal year 2023 were more significant.

 Financial - Debt   Highlight
