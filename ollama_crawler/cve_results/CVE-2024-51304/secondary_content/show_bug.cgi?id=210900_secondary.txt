xorg-docs-1.4-r1 apparently does not download all files needed with command
"emerge -f xorg-docs"

After an "emerge -f xorg-docs", if the computer is disconnected from the internet, a later "emerge xorg-docs" fails but after the computer is reconnected to the internet, then "emerge xorg-docs" succeeds.

Well, maybe if you could reopen with some errors...
