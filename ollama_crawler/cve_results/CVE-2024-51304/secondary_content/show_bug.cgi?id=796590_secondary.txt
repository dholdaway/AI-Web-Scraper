It's currently not possible to install geogebra:

    # emerge -av geogebra-bin
    
    These are the packages that would be merged, in order:
    
    Calculating dependencies... done!
    
    emerge: there are no ebuilds to satisfy "dev-java/openjdk:11[javafx]".
    (dependency required by "sci-mathematics/geogebra-bin-5.0.604.0-r2::gentoo" [ebuild])
    (dependency required by "geogebra-bin" [argument])

hi,


it's stable.masked, so you have to unmask javafx useflag for openjdk, along with unmasking geogebra or accepting keywords on stable system. after that portage will be able to resolve the conflict.
also you have to accept keywords for openjfx and maybe couple other unstable packages it will pull.
