Description

If gnutls is not installed, the xend-config settings for TLS security for VNC will be silently ignored. 

If gnutls is installed, the internal qemu build detects it and the TLS settings in xend-config will work.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge xen-tools in the absence of gnutls
2. configure xend for opportunistic TLS (and for certificate auth)
3. connect with VeNCrypt etc

Actual Results:  
No crypto at all (and no certificate auth). No error, just a plain VNC connection.

Expected Results:  
Either an error from xend or working crypto.

I think the solution is a tls USE flag for xen-tools with a conditional dep on gnutls.
