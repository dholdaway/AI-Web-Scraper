gnome-base/gnome-do-plugins-0.8.0 requires monodeveop as a dependency: I don't see the reason for a set of plugins to require a full IDE, and even the website doesn't mention that requirement http://do.davebsd.com/wiki/index.php?title=Installing_Do#From_Source

Moreover, monodevelop causes a dependency mismatch with mono-2.2: the former requires monodoc but the latter doesn't want any version of that package installed.

I moved the gnome-do-plugins ebuild to my local overlay, removing the line of monodevelop, and everything runs fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Put gnome-do, gnome-do-plugins, mono, monodevelop, etc in package.keywords
2. Try to install gnome-do-plugins

Actual Results:  
Mono forbids the installation of monodoc, while monodevelop (dependency of gnome-do-plugins) requires it.

Expected Results:  
gnome-do-plugins shouldn't have monodevelop as a dependency.

The reason that monodevelop is a dependency is because the gnome-do-plugins make system uses one of its tools (mdtool) to prepare the plugins for use. I was not able to get the plugins to install without it when I created the initial ebuild.

As far as I can tell monodevelop 1.9.1 now uses a virtual dependency for monodoc which I assume also works fine with mono 2.2.

Please re-open if this remains a problem.
