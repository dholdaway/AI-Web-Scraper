Since i've upgraded to SquirrelMail 1.4.10a, i can't make working the show_ssl_link plugin, which is really interesting to me ... I've just upgraded to 1.4.10a-r2 today, and same problem...
I had the same problem with gpg plugin, but it's seems the bug is already filled...
To be more explicit, the plugin is working, but it doesn't get any information from the config.php file ... which give info about the redirection link and such ...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Enable SquirrelMail - show_ssl_link plugin
2.Configure it (via config.php)
3.Look at the result

Actual Results:  
the link is there, but it didn't point to the accurate url

Expected Results:  
A working link to the accurate url

What URL is it pointing to for you?  It looks right to me on my sites, are you sure you set it up in config.php correctly?

hi there ...

to give you more details on my problem ...

webmail is hosted at http://webmail.domain.tld/ and ssl version is located at https://www.domain.tld/webmail/
So i configured the show_ssl_link plugin with the following parameters ...

$my_ssl_url = 'https://www.domain.tld/webmail/';

When i activate the plugin ... it displays the "Secure Login" link ... but when i click on it ... it points me to https://webmail.domain.tld/ and that's not what i ask for :P

that's it ... hope it helps

cya!
