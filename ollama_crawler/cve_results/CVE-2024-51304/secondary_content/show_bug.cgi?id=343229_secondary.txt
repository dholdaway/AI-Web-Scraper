Description

Since a few days ago, I was experiencing some annoying problems with metacity: it was crashing when opening windows like "display", wine windows, openoffice, set a flash video to full screen...

Finally, looks like the problem is in icon theme, running metacity on a terminal shows me the following when crashing:

metacity:ERROR:ui/ui.c:752:meta_ui_get_default_window_icon: assertion failed: (default_icon)

And downgrading to x11-themes/gnome-icon-theme-2.30.3 makes it work again :-D

But I am unsure about reporting this to upstream since I thought Gnome 2.32 was supposed to continue using gnome-icon-theme-2.30 instead of "unstable" 2.31 :-/

Reproducible: Always

Will probably drop 2.31.0 since Gnome 2.32 looks to work fine with 2.30 icon theme
