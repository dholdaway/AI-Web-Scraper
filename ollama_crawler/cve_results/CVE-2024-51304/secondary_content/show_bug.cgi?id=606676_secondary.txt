change install path for HTML docs from `/usr/share/doc/${P}/doc/html` to `/usr/share/doc/${P}/html` and use `dohtml` instead of `dodoc`...

(going to attach a patch)

Reproducible: Always

dohtml is kind of deprecated, and will probably be banned in the next EAPI, so not going to use it.

The html doc install path looks correct to me...

$ ls usr/share/doc/sip-4.19/html/
annotations.html   command_line.html  embedding.html          index.html         objects.inv       search.html     specification_files.html
build_system.html  directives.html    genindex.html           installation.html  py-modindex.html  searchindex.js  _static
c_api.html         distutils.html     incompatibilities.html  introduction.html  python_api.html   _sources        using.html
