Description

This is an auto-filled bug because this package should create some paths at runtime.

 * QA Notice: This ebuild installs into paths that should be created at runtime.
 *  To fix, simply do not install into these directories.  Instead, your package
 *  should create dirs on the fly at runtime as needed via init scripts/etc...
 * 
 *   var/cache
 *   var/cache/fonts

runtime of what? it's mostly a lib and the font cache is used by tens of packages/utilities

better just ignore the warning (or fix it) for this one
