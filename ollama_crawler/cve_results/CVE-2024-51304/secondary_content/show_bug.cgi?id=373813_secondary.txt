After ugrading several GNOME libraries (without touching a fully functional gnome-bluetooth installation) the commands bluetooth-applet and bluetooth-properties are broken and give the following error:

  ** Message: adding killswitch idx 0 state KILLSWITCH_STATE_UNBLOCKED
  ** Message: killswitch 0 is KILLSWITCH_STATE_UNBLOCKED
  ** Message: killswitches state KILLSWITCH_STATE_UNBLOCKED
  ** Message: killswitch 0 is KILLSWITCH_STATE_UNBLOCKED
  ** Message: killswitches state KILLSWITCH_STATE_UNBLOCKED

  GLib-GIO-ERROR **: Settings schema 'org.gnome.Bluetooth' is not installed

  aborting...
  Aborted

The org.gnome.Bluetooth schema, however, is installed in

  /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/org.gnome.Bluetooth.gschema.xml

Thank you, Mike

What gnome-bluetooth version do you have installed? Did you updated all your system?

gnome-bluetooth version and emerge --info output


Hi Pacho, thanks for the speedy reply. I am using gnome-bluetooth-2.32.0 with
USE="(multilib) -debug -doc (-introspection) -nautilus". More info as attachment. Yes, I did update all the relevant gnome libraries (marked as [U] in today's portage). Best, Mike

Hurray!!! The problem seems to be resolved. I recompiled the following packages:

emerge -av gnome-base/gconf gnome-base/gnome-settings-daemon dev-libs/glib

Perhaps not all dependencies were correctly resolved by the previous upgrade.

Many thanks in any case.
Best, Mike

How did you tried to compile that set of packages? :-/, not sure what could be the culprit (maybe glib, or maybe schemas generation failed before and simply reinstalling another package using gnome2.eclass solved the issue...)

(using WORKSFORME as I cannot reproduce)
