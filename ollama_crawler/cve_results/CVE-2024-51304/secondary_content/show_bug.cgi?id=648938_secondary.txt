Created attachment 521234 [details]
emerge --info

trying to build a cross-environment with sys-devel/crossdev-2080120 fails at GCC-Stage2.

It definitely happens with "-march=native" in make.conf.
I will update this bug regarding a left blank "-march" and "-march=nehalem".
Nehalem is, what my system would use with "native".

....clearing out /var/log/portage and retrying with the same command and environment worked. Strange, but worksforme
