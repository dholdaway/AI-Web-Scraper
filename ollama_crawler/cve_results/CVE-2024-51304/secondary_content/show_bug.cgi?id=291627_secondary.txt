KPDF worked beautifully.

kde-base/okular-4.3.1 also works great, but lost any ability to print. Opening a print dialog box (before one can even select a printer), makes Okular to hang.

All other applications (OpenOffice, Thunderbird, etc.) continue printing without problems.

The only printing system installed is net-print/cups-1.3.10-r2 configured as a client connecting to a print server.

Do you happen to have cups useflag on your qt-gui?

No response for a few months, and works fine here. Resolving.
