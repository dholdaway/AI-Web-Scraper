I have tried emerging it two times, with two different failures during test phase. Logs will be attached shortly. On a different, ~x86 box, all tests pass.

Does gnome-doc-utils-0.8 show the same problem perhaps? It might be that the DTD document that is used over HTTP might have changed or something like that, which is somewhat out of our control

BTW, when copying the .omf file elsewhere and calling xmllint with same command line as   in the logs, it finished succesfully.

Hmm... This is not an obvious problem, since it passes here for me on ~amd64 + gnome overlay.  So something related to the parsing is fixed by the overlay, or something is broken by your box.

Remerging scrollkeeper made tests pass - although I still get unknown IO errors from xmllint. Emerge doesn't die anymore, though.
