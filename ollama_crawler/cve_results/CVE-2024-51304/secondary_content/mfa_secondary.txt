 Inside Mfa Financial, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 M & A - Other   Highlight
An allowance for credit losses is recorded at acquisition, and maintained on an ongoing basis, for all losses expected over the life of the respective loan.



 Other - Other   Highlight
Our investments in residential mortgage assets expose us to credit risk, meaning that we are generally subject to credit losses due to the risk of delinquency, default and foreclosure on the underlying real estate collateral.

 Other - Other   Highlight
For certain other agreements that do not include such provisions, we could resolve the matter by substituting collateral as permitted in accordance with the agreement or otherwise request the counterparty to return the collateral in exchange for cash to unwind the financing.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Changes in market conditions, as well as changes in the assumptions or methodology used to determine fair value, could result in a significant increase or decrease in fair value.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
These expenses decreased compared to 2022 by approximately $8.8 million, or 20.4%, primarily due to lower expenses recognized related to loan securitization activities, lower diligence and other costs associated with acquiring loans, lower servicing fees, and lower expenses on our REO portfolio.
