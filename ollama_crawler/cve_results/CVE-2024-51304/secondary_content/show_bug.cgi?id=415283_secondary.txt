Description

can't update system because no matter what USE flags i set i get some conflicts:

right now i have this in package.use/curl (because portage told me to set it like this):

net-misc/curl curl_ssl_gnutls

here's the output i get on emerge -

These are the packages that would be merged, in order:

Calculating dependencies... done!

!!! The ebuild selected to satisfy ">=net-misc/curl-7.10" has unmet requirements.
- net-misc/curl-7.25.0-r1::gentoo USE="ipv6 (multilib) ssl -ares -idn -kerberos -ldap -ssh -static-libs -test -threads" CURL_SSL="gnutls openssl -axtls -cyassl -nss -polarssl"

  The following REQUIRED_USE flag constraints are unsatisfied:
    ssl? ( exactly-one-of ( curl_ssl_axtls curl_ssl_cyassl curl_ssl_gnutls curl_ssl_openssl curl_ssl_nss curl_ssl_polarssl ) )

  The above constraints are a subset of the following complete expression:
    threads? ( !ares ) ssl? ( exactly-one-of ( curl_ssl_axtls curl_ssl_cyassl curl_ssl_gnutls curl_ssl_openssl curl_ssl_nss curl_ssl_polarssl ) )

(dependency required by "app-crypt/gnupg-2.0.19[-static]" [installed])
(dependency required by "app-crypt/gpgme-1.3.1" [installed])
(dependency required by "kde-base/kdepimlibs-4.8.3" [installed])
(dependency required by "kde-base/kdeplasma-addons-4.8.3[semantic-desktop]" [installed])
(dependency required by "@selected" [set])
(dependency required by "@world" [argument])


if i change the USE flag to, let's say, net-misc/curl gnutls, i'm told to set curl_ssl_gnutls.


Reproducible: Always

It requires exactly _one_ of these in CURL_SSL:
 gnutls openssl axtls cyassl nss polarssl

but you have:
CURL_SSL="gnutls openssl -axtls -cyassl -nss -polarssl".

Which is two, so that's wrong. It might be best to set CURL_SSL in /etc/make.conf and remove the package.use entry.

Otherwise, I don't see a bug here. Next time, ask on our forums or in our IRC channels.
