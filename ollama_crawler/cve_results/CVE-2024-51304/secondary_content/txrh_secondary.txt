 Inside Texas Roadhouse, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
As we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our long-lived assets, these factors could cause us to realize a material impairment charge.



 Other - Other   Highlight
Changes in circumstances existing at the measurement date or at other times in the future could result in an impairment loss.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
Whether we are able and/or choose to continue to offset the effects of inflation will determine to what extent, if any, inflation affects our restaurant profitability in future periods.

 Other - Other   Highlight
The breakage adjustment relates to a change in our estimate of breakage due to a shift in our historic redemption pattern which indicated that the percentage of gift cards sold that are not expected to be redeemed had increased.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Some of the impacts of inflation have been offset by menu price increases and other adjustments made during the year.
