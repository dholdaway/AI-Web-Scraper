 Inside Allegiant Travel Co's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changing market prices of our aircraft, changes in utilization of the aircraft, and other fleet events.



 Other - Other   Highlight
Until new agreements are in place, attrition and difficulty hiring sufficient personnel in the affected work groups could have an adverse effect on our operations and growth.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
The cost per gallon of fuel began to increase significantly in 2021, and the increases were exacerbated by the geopolitical impact of the war in Ukraine.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Aircraft fuel expense decreased $118.9 million, or 14.6 percent, in 2023 compared to 2022.

 Other - Other   Highlight
This increase was offset by a $51.9 million increase in proceeds from maturities of investment securities, net of purchases, and a $30.3 million increase in insurance proceeds from damages at the Sunseeker Resort.
