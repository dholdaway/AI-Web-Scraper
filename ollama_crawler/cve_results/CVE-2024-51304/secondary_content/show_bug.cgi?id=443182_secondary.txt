emerge --info chromium

I reported this bug upstream (http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=160448), but since the problem only exists in Chromium and not in Chrome, this sounds like a Gentoo problem.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. In chrome://flags, enable the "Smooth scrolling" setting
2. Restart Chrome
3. Go to http://git-scm.com/documentation

What is the expected behavior?
Using the mouse wheel to scroll up/down should be smooth.

What went wrong?
Scrolling is not smooth when using the mouse wheel. It's only smooth when using the keyboard (Up/Down arrow keys or PageUp/PageDown keys.)

Did this work before? No 

This bug can't be reproduces in all sites. For example, in http://www.youtube.com scrolling with the mouse wheel is smooth. The bug is there in the majority of sites though. It's rare to find a site where it works correctly.

Smooth scrolling works fine for me in chromium-24.0.1312.5.

Hm. I don't have any extensions installed. So that only leaves a bug in Chromium's handling of old settings. I never "rm -r ~/.config/chromium" when I update it. I now did that and scrolling works. Of course I lost all my settings, bookmarks, passwords, everything.

Can this be considered a bug? Am I supposed to wipe out my ~/.config/chromium when I update to a new version?

That does sound a bit buggy, but probably not Gentoo-specific. I would call it a hazard of using an experimental feature in a beta version of the software.
