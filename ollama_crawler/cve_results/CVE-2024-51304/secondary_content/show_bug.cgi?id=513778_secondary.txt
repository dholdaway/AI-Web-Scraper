Consider how portage screwed up is handling MULTILIB_USEDEP, it would be best if no package >= than the multilib version would be non-multilib, non-EAPI 5. Could we drop the masked _beta1-r2? That's not very important as long as it is masked though.

we aren't going to use EAPI=5 here

the beta's are going to stay masked forever

the actual releases will not regress in functionality

all those things taken together lead to the conclusion of "nothing needs to be done" wrt the openssl beta ebuilds
