Description

After emerging tex4ht, commands like htlatex, xhlatex, etc. should be available
But the ebuild doesn't seem to install them. I checked the tarball and htlatex and friends can be founds under bin/ht/unix/ inside the tarball. So I wonder why they are not installed.

Reproducible: Always

that's why there's this at the end of ebuild:

        elog "In order to avoid collisions with multiple packages"
        elog "We are not installing the scripts in /usr/bin anymore"
        elog "If you want to use, say, htlatex, you can use 'mk4ht htlatex file'"


reading helps sometimes :=)
