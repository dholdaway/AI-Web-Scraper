 Inside Domo, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:

We expect foreign currency gains and losses could become more pronounced due to current market volatility.



 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Alternatively, we may be required to reduce expenses to manage liquidity; however, any such reductions could adversely impact our business and competitive position.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.

 Financial - Debt   Highlight
If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness, such indebtedness likely would have rights that are senior to holders of our equity securities and could contain covenants that restrict operations in the same or similar manner as our credit facility.

 Other - Other   Highlight
