Hi,
it seems that the sidebar of evolution is set to a minimum width value. On my netbook with a 1024x600 screen this value is 227, on my notebook with a screen resolution of 1400x1050 this is 231. 
This forces the evolution window to be wider that 1024 pixels on the netbook, which is too large for the screen.
I started ubuntu 10.4 to see what they are doing, and they install evolution version 2.28.*, so that was no help.
The width value is stored in gconf under /apps/evolution/shell/view_defaults/folder_bar/width.
Overwriting this key to a smaller value makes no difference, since evolution writes this value on startup.

Can somebody reproduce this behaviour? Should I write an upstream bug report?

Btw. it's just too bad the express2 branch of evolution (from meego) needs >=evolution-data-server-2.31.4. I could provide a hacked live-ebuild for that, if somebody is interested.

Hi,

my upstream bug is closed. Deleting the old gconf and gconfd directories fixed the width problem of evolution. Additionally it added screen dimming while inactive (probably of gnome-power-manager).
I don't believe the corresponding gconf keys can be determined. If you are interested to do it nevertheless, I still have the old gconf(d) directories, else the bug can be closed.

OK, thanks for the reminder, if you are able to reproduce on a new created user account after following some exact steps, feel free to reopen (also upstream bug)

Best regards
