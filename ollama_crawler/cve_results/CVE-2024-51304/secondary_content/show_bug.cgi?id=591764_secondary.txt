Could some of the 4.6 ebuilds be put back in the tree?  I have 4.7 hard-masked because it makes google-chrome crash on startup.

gentoo-sources-4.6 doesn't have to be in tree for you to continue using it. Just don't depclean the sources.

too late...

...I didn't even noticed they'd been depcleaned until 4.4 was already installed

though I would like to ask...was there any special reason for 4.6 to be removed or was it just routine tree maintenance?

Maintenance, and if I had to guess, bug 591624

That actually looks like a good reason to punt it.

Yeah looks like mpagano booted 4.6 out of the tree just today, only 48 hours or so after the bug you cited was filed.

Most probably because 4.6 is EOL (check kernel.org).
