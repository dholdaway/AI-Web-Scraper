Gross margins for the fourth quarter remained strong at 78%, reflecting a favorable mix of higher margin software sales and our ability to pass along price increases. We achieved our fiscal 2023 guidance for both revenue and adjusted diluted EPS.”“Our renewal harmonization initiative to simplify and align contract renewals played out as expected and is essentially complete. We achieved our goal of gaining greater visibility into our revenues, and with contract harmonization now embedded in the normal course of our business processes, we expect that both Simulations Plus and our customers will see the benefits going forward.”“The integration of Immunetrics is going well. Immunetrics brings its strong reputation in the immunology and oncology markets and has a healthy pipeline, including new accounts sourced from our Simulations Plus customer base.”“We believe that we enter fiscal 2024 well-positioned for continued growth. The underlying fundamentals of our market are resilient, our pipeline is healthy, our profitability is strong, and our balance sheet is sound. Our team remains committed to innovative and disciplined growth that delivers long-term returns for our shareholders.”Fiscal 2024 GuidanceFiscal 2024 GuidanceAnnual IncreaseRevenue$66M - $69M10 - 15%Software mix55 - 60%—Services mix40 - 45%—Diluted earnings per share$0.66 - $0.6835 - 39%Quarterly DividendThe Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.06 per share of the Company’s common stock, payable on November 6, 2023, to shareholders of record as of October 30, 2023.

A replay and transcript of the webcast will be available shortly after the event.Non-GAAP DefinitionsAdjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, (gain) loss on currency exchange, any acquisition- or financial-transaction-related expenses, and any asset impairment charges. Currency exchange excluded represents the exchange rate fluctuations on the foreign currency denominated transactions. The impact of transactions in foreign currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expenses occurring in a currency other than the functional currency. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of its results between periods. The Company’s management uses non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate its ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA represents a measure that we believe is customarily used by investors and analysts to evaluate the financial performance of companies in addition to the GAAP measures that we present. Our management also believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating our core operating results. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and should not be considered an alternative to net income or operating income as an indicator of our operating performance or to net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. The Company’s Adjusted EBITDA measure may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in its industry, as other companies in its industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to nonrecurring, unusual items.Adjusted Diluted EPSAdjusted diluted EPS is calculated based on net income excluding the impact of any acquisition- or financial-transaction-related expenses, any asset impairment charges, and tax provisions / benefits related to the previous items. The Company excludes the above items because they are outside of the Company’s normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. The Company believes that the use of non-GAAP measures helps investors to gain a better understanding of the Company’s core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the Company’s performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods or forecasts.About Simulations PlusServing clients worldwide for more than 25 years, Simulations Plus is a leading provider in the biosimulation market providing software and consulting services supporting drug discovery, development, research, and regulatory submissions.

Words like “believe,” “expect,” and “anticipate” mean that these are our best estimates as of this writing, but there can be no assurances that expected or anticipated results or events will actually take place, so our actual future results could differ significantly from those statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: our ability to successfully integrate the Immunetrics business with our own, as well as expenses we may incur in connection therewith, our ability to maintain our competitive advantages, acceptance of new software and improved versions of our existing software by our customers, the general economics of the pharmaceutical industry, our ability to finance growth, our ability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified technical staff, market conditions, macroeconomic factors, and a sustainable market. Further information on our risk factors is contained in our quarterly and annual reports and filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Investor Relations Contacts:Tamara GonzalezFinancial Profiles310-622-8234slp@finprofiles.comRenee BoucheSimulations Plus Investor Relations661-723-7723renee.bouche@simulations-plus.com1The following information was filed by Simulations Plus Inc (SLP) on Wednesday, October 25, 2023 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.
