Hello:

sip-virtual / # emerge rpm -pv

These are the packages that I would merge, in order:

Calculating dependencies ...done!
[blocks B     ] dev-libs/beecrypt (is blocking app-arch/rpm-4.2-r1)

Any help?

You need rpm-4.2.1

> You need rpm-4.2.1

yes, but rpm-4.2.1 is, as I have been told on the list, removed from/not available to the x86 tree, as well as several others (amd64, ppc64, ppc macos).

echo "app-arch/rpm -x86" >> /etc/portage/package.keywords
