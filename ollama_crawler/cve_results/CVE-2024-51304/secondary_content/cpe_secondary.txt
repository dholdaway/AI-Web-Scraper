On December 15th, 2023, the NVD plans to retire all legacy data feeds while guiding any 
					remaining data feed users to updated application-programming interfaces (APIs). APIs have 
					many benefits over data feeds and have been the proven and preferred approach to web-based
					automation for over a decade. For additional information on the NVD API, please visit the 
					developers pages.

Official Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) Dictionary

				CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. 
				Based upon the generic syntax for Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI), CPE includes a formal 
				name format, a method for checking names against a system, and a description format for binding 
				text and tests to a name.
			

				Below is the current official version of the CPE Product Dictionary. The dictionary provides 
				an agreed upon list of official CPE names. The dictionary is provided in XML format and is available 
				to the general public. Please check back frequently as the CPE Product Dictionary will continue to 
				grow to include all past, present and future product releases. The CPE Dictionary is updated nightly 
				when modifications or new names are added.
			

				As of December 2009, The National Vulnerability Database is now accepting contributions to the Official 
				CPE Dictionary. Organizations interested in submitting CPE Names should contact the NVD CPE team at 
				cpe_dictionary@nist.gov for help with the processing of 
				their submission.

				The CPE Dictionary hosted and maintained at NIST may be used by nongovernmental organizations on a 
				voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright in the United States. Attribution would, however, 
				be appreciated by NIST.
