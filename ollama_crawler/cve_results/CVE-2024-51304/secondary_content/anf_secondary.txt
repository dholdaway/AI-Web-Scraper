ABERCROMBIE & FITCH CO. REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR RESULTS•Company delivers fourth quarter net sales growth of 21%, led by 35% growth in Abercrombie brands•Full year net sales of $4.28 billion, up 16% to 2022, driven by comparable sales up 13%•Full year net sales growth across regions and brands; Abercrombie brands comparable sales up 23%•Full year operating margin of 11.3%, highest in fifteen years and up 880 basis points to full year 2022New Albany, Ohio, March 6, 2024:  Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (NYSE: ANF) today announced results for the fourteen week fourth quarter and fifty-three week year ended February 3, 2024. These compare to results for the thirteen week fourth quarter and fifty-two week year ended January 28, 2023. Descriptions of the use of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures accompany this release. Fran Horowitz, Chief Executive Officer, said, “I am incredibly proud of how we performed throughout fiscal 2023, finishing with fourth quarter year-over-year net sales growth of 21%, which exceeded our January business update expectations. Our strong fourth quarter was fueled by sales growth across regions and brands. Abercrombie brands grew net sales 35%, continuing an impressive multi-quarter growth trend, while Hollister brands grew 9%, delivering a third consecutive quarter of sales growth. By staying close to our customers, tightly controlling inventories and continuing to operate with financial discipline, our team delivered year-over-year fourth quarter operating margin expansion of 800 basis points, reaching 15.3%. Following several years of transformation across our brands, people and operating model, fiscal 2023 was a defining year for our company. In the first full year of our Always Forward Plan, we executed our playbook, delivering the right product, voice and experience across regions and brands to our global customers. Abercrombie brands finished an exceptional year with 27% net sales growth over 2022, reflecting a strong 10% compound annual growth rate from fiscal 2019. Hollister brands completed a return to sales growth of 6% over fiscal 2022, reconnecting with teen customers. Operationally, we fueled sales growth using our well-developed inventory chase capabilities while funding critical long-term investments in our people, stores and key technology platforms. Compared to 2022, we grew annual net sales 16%, improved gross profit rate by 600 basis points and delivered an operating margin of 11.3%, our highest in 15 years and above our 2025 Always Forward Plan operating margin target.We entered fiscal 2024 in a position of strength with momentum across our brand portfolio. The success of our playbook gives us confidence that we can now shift more of our focus to expanding our global customer base. This year, our goal is to deliver sustainable, profitable growth while making the necessary investments to build and support our longer-term ambition of $5 billion in global sales.” Details related to net income per diluted share for the fourth quarter and full year are as follows:Fourth QuarterFull Year2023202220232022GAAP$2.97 $0.75 $6.22 $0.05 Excluded items, net of tax effect (1)— (0.07)(0.06)(0.20)Adjusted non-GAAP$2.97 $0.81 $6.28 $0.25 Impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates (2)— 0.07 — (0.13)Adjusted non-GAAP constant currency$2.97 $0.88 $6.28 $0.12 (1)Excluded items consist of pre-tax store and other asset impairment charges and the tax effect of pre-tax excluded items.(2)The estimated impact from foreign currency is calculated by applying current period exchange rates to prior year results using a 26% tax rate.A summary of results for the fourth quarter ended February 3, 2024:•Net sales of $1.5 billion up 21% as compared to last year on a reported basis and 21% on a constant currency basis. The additional week in fiscal 2023 benefited fourth quarter net sales by approximately $50 million, or 430 basis points.•Comparable sales up 16%.•Gross profit rate of 62.9%, up 720 basis points as compared to last year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by 430 basis points of higher average unit retail and 290 basis points associated with lower freight and raw material costs.•Operating expense, excluding other operating income, net, was up 19% as compared to last year, with the increase driven by higher incentive compensation, marketing, inflation, the 53rd reporting week and digital and technology expenses. Operating expense as a percentage of sales decreased to 47.6% from 48.3% last year.•Operating income of $223 million as compared to $87 million and $92 million last year, on a reported and adjusted non-GAAP basis, respectively.•Net income per diluted share of $2.97 as compared to net income per diluted share last year of $0.75 and $0.81 on a reported and adjusted non-GAAP basis, respectively.1The following information was filed by Abercrombie Fitch Co (ANF) on Thursday, March 7, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.

 Inside Abercrombie Fitch Co's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Expense   Highlight
However, actual results could vary from estimates and could significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost, as well as gross profit.



 Financial - Income   Highlight
However, changes in these judgments, assumptions or interpretations may occur and should those changes be significant, they could have a material impact on the Company’s income tax provision.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Although management also develops and updates contingency plans to assist in mitigating potential impacts, it is possible that the Company’s preparations for such events are not adequate to mitigate their impact, and that these events could further adversely affect its business and results of operations.

 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
As a global multi-brand omnichannel specialty retailer, with operations in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, among other regions, management is mindful of macroeconomic risks, global challenges and the changing global geopolitical environment, including the ongoing armed conflicts between Russia and Ukraine or Israel and Hamas, and conflict in the surrounding areas, which could adversely impact certain areas of the business.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Due to the seasonal nature of the retail apparel industry, the results of operations for any current period are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full fiscal year and the Company could have significant fluctuations in certain asset and liability accounts.
