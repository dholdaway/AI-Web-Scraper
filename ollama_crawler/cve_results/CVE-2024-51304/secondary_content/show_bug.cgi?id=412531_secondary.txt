The solution for bug 379261 worked for me also here: just re-emerge dev-tex/luatex.

Re-emerge of dev-tex/luatex-0.70.1 didn't change anything

Found the source of this problem.
I had bootstraped my system, but copiey /etc from an old installation, including /etc/texmf
Some files in there from dev-texlive/texlive-langgerman caused these problems.
Emerge of dev-texlive/texlive-langgerman with --nodeps (since it requires texlive-basic) worked and after that texlive-basic compiled fine.

The files causing problems were
/etc/texmf/language.def.d/language.texlive-langgerman.{def,dat}
