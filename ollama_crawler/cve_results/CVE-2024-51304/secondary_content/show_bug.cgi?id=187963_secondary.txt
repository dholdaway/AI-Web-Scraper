Set yourself GENTOO_MIRRORS in make.conf like anyone else.

i did, but when i attempted to emerge gnome it was looking for zip-2.31, which was not found on any of my mirrors so when it tried to default to info-zip's ftp it hung and failed. 

I located the package and completed the emerge last night but i figured i would inform the maintainers that the default ftp site for that package was dead.

Thanks,
~ron
