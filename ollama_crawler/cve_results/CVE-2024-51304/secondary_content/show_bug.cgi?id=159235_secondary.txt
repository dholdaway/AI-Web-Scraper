Developers complaint about 0day version bump bugs in bugzilla, for example see bug 159203, however there is no other mecanism to keep up with version bumps of some particular package without having to constantly refresh a page.

A better way would be if packages.gentoo.org provided an rss feed for every package, so whenever a version bump, masking, unmasking or drop of a package happens, the users get a notification of the change.

Another way is to put cc per package in packages.gentoo.org and mailing those people when something changes. I suspect this would be more complicated.

There's absolutely no need to file version bump bugs unless *at least* one week elapsed after the release.

Otherwise, I fail to see what you are requesting here, the feeds are already there: http://packages.gentoo.org/feeds/

hopefully I can explain myself a little better:

I want to be notified when beryl is bumped.

Currently the feeds you provide will give me a notification whenever something changes in all of portage, so beryl updates get lost in the noise.

One way to do it would be if the feeds accept the same parameters as the search, for example, 
http://packages.gentoo.org/gentoo_simple.rss?sstring=beryl,

would give the same results as the search page but in rss format. To make it easilly accessible, the search page could provide a link to that feed, so you could search for your package, and subscribe to the feed associated with the search.

I will leave it to you to reopen the bug if you think it is usefull, or please provide a workaround if there is some other way to do this.

We really have no intention to create thousands of RSS feeds just because you can't deal with "noise", sorry.

I am not talking about thousands of rss feeds, it would be just one server side script that would read the parameters query the package database and produce the results in rss format. it is just 1 SCRIPT.

do you know of a workaround?

And I suspect a lot of the code is already there, just rehuse the code you use in the search page, but instead of producing the output in html, produce it in rss

@Paul Pacheco: Instead on filtering on the server side, any decent rss aggregator can do that on the client side. I use akregator, which offers a big search bar, and if I type "beryl" in it, only headlines with beryl will be displayed.

@markduk:
thank you for accepting the feature request. I really appreciate it.

@Tassilo:
Yes I use akregator too, and I still have to open, filter and see now and then, that means that I have to keep "polling" the rss results. To me at least, that defeats the whole purpose of having an rss aggregator.

Interestingly enough, the "new" packages.gentoo.org code already has the mechanisms for showing just bumps or just new packages, even for a particular platform.  All it's missing is the anything-to-rss engine, though I don't consider that a big deal to implement.

The problem with the "new" (P2) code is that it is outdated, though not as much as the current ("old") code.  The new code runs on a older version of Quixote.  I was going to port it to Quixote 2, but considered maybe CherryPy or even PHP instead.  A few months ago I took this up with the infra group, but never got a response.  These days my interest in Gentoo development has been sporadic but mostly nonexistent.  

Perhaps even another re-write (P3) is in order.  I really don't want to add new features to the current code because it's older proof-of-concept code that should have been thrown out a long time ago.

But if somebody wants to submit a patch...

Reassigning to the main infra group since Marduk is retired.

The new packages2 has this.
