updating girara:2 to the latest version pulls gtk3 and all it's dependencies, because of the following lines in the ebuild:

17 # Pull in SLOT="3" for headers
18 RDEPEND="${CATEGORY}/${PN}:3
19     >=x11-libs/gtk+-2.18.6:2"
and
50 src_install() {
51     emake "${mygiraraconf[@]}" install
52     dodoc AUTHORS
53 
54     rm -rf "${ED}"/usr/include/${PN}
55 }

is that really necessary?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge -av =girara-0.1.5-r200
Actual Results:  
additional megabytes of dependencies pulled in

Expected Results:  
gtk3 not installed

Old SLOT gets headers from new SLOT. Seems sane to me. I'm not adding third SLOT just for headers, since the old SLOT for GTK+ 2.x will go away soon as I figure out the issues with app-text/zathura and pdf plugins.

Sorry but this bug really doesn't help, thanks for reporting anyway

So what do you add it for?

Why? Girara perfectly supports both gtk2 and gtk3, and since gtk3 is infinitely bloated and unusable, I prefer to stick to gtk2.

So does you comment, thanks for writing it.

zathura can be built GTK+ 3.x and PDF works using the mupdf plug-in. I just need to sort our mupdf package to build libraries -fPIC (preferably shared ones)

Because GTK+ 3.x is an upgrade to GTK+ 2.x and I'm not intrested in your personal opinions about it. Also not going to discuss this again here, read bug 374057
