Description


Crístian Viana





          2010-01-20 12:24:14 UTC
        

the file /usr/lib64/libjpeg.so.62 is owned by jpeg-7 and jpeg-6b-r9:

$ portageq owners / /usr/lib64/libjpeg.so.62
media-libs/jpeg-7
    /usr/lib64/libjpeg.so.62
media-libs/jpeg-6b-r9
    /usr/lib64/libjpeg.so.62

on one computer I have, both libraries are installed at the same time. but when I try to merge the binary package to another machine, it detects a collision and stops emerging.

this bug is similar to #288369.

This shouldn't be a problem anymore since the preserve old lib logic was dropped from media-libs/jpeg-7... re-emerge it.

(The more proper fix will be in Portage 2.2 and preserved-libs feature)

thanks, I reemerged jpeg-7 and now the collision on that computer is gone!
