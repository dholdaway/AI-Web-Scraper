Description

i upgraded to python 2.6.1 a day ago and ran python-updater. ipython 0.9.1 won't merge since. it points to a file in zopeinterface package, where the python keyword 'with' is used as a variable name.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. update python to 2.6.1
2. run python updater oder try to merge ipython 0.9.1


Actual Results:  
ebuild fails

Expected Results:  
ipython merges

# v is {with -> tuple([object])}
for with, objects in v.iteritems():
    oldwithobs[with] = oldwithobs.get(with, ()) + objects

this is the critical code at line 185 of adapter.py in zopeinterface
the keyword 'with' is used as name for an index variable.
