x11-libs/qt-gui-4.6.1  USE="accessibility cups dbus glib gtk mng qt3support tiff (-aqua) -debug -nas -nis -pch -raster -xinerama" does not compile

Multiple undefined references while linking libQtScriptTools.so.4.6.1

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge --quiet -av qt-gui

Actual Results:  
src_compile failed

Expected Results:  
to compile properly

I was trying to emerge kde-base/kdebase-startkde-4.3.4 which pulled in x11-libs/qt-gui-4.6.1 - the other 70 KDE packages cannot be merged without qt-gui (so I mark as Blocker).

Please try without ccache and see if that changes anything.

I removed cchace, no change (I also tried purging it's cache before reporting). BTW, 4.6.0 compiled OK on an x86 with ccache sometime last week.

Hello did you find the solution ? i have the same issue :-(

I haven't found a solution. Furthermore, I tried compiling qt-gui-4.6.2 on the same machine with the same results. All the other qt-4.6.2 packages (except qt-qt3support which requires qt-gui) merge without problems. Enabling or disabling 'qt3support' flag is not the problem - same result.

x11-libs/qt-gui-4.6.2  USE="accessibility cups dbus exceptions glib gtk mng tiff (-aqua) -debug -nas -nis -pch -qt3support -raster -xinerama"

This is kind of annoying because it prevents the whole KDE-4.x from building... I'll try emerging on a 32bit machine when I have the time, and see what happens.

Attach your /etc/ld.so.conf please.
