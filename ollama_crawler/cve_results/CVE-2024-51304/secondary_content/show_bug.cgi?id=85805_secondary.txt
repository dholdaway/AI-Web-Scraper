This is from stable xorg 6.8.0 -> .2. The symlink and rmdir line obviously didn't worked, also it's irritating that you tell my I have the debug flag enabled, just because I have nostrip in features.

You're a developer, why don't you attach a patch to fix this?

Good point. Maybe because I'm not a X herd guy?! On the other hand I often think the same when developers are not even capable to assign correctly and push it to bug wranglers instead. I just noticed and filed it promptly. When I'm ready with some stuff burning under my fingers, I'll have a look at it.
