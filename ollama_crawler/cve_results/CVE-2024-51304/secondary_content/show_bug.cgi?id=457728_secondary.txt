That is a long list, there is a high chance that you might be using something that is not in the Portage tree; so, you could be experiencing something like a broken library from an overlay.

You might want to run `emerge -ep =media-video/smplayer2-0.8.0_p20130111` and check whether smplayer2 or one of its dependencies is from an overlay; if so, please try to emerge them again from the gentoo repository to get smplayer2 to run with gentoo-only dependencies.

ok it seems to be not broken at all. 

i tested the best case: smplayer2 is not broken with the currently overlays.

i start a xterminal and start a file: "smplayer2 lön.mp3".
 
it runs fine, but strating by klicking in filemanager to open it let application start, not thing happened.

Sounds like a bug with your file manager then, which file manager is this?

i am using spacefm , neiter stable, unstable or 9999 version works in this case.

it igno to open pdf files with acroread, and ignore any media files with a letter like "ä" "ü" "ö".

Can you check for spacefm that there are no overlay packages in the way? You can do that with `emerge -epv1 x11-misc/spacefm`. To make this more useful, could you also attach the output of that emerge command such that we know the versions of the libraries that are being used (and their USE flag settings)?

I have assigned the bug to the maintainer of spacefm.

cannot reproduce

I doubt this is related to the file manager. Broken .desktop file or something.

Actually, a better guess would be a standard "wrong mount options".

While your system'locale is utf8, chances are one of the filesystems isn't and you're getting a mess in effect.

Other possibility is that it's an effect of unpacking a zip archive, which are notoriously bad at preserving file names across locales.

its utf8, because it on a utf8 ext4 partition.

fstab mount option:

/dev/sdb5   /home               ext4    noatime,nodiratime                          0

well, this is not a support forum

for this to be a valid bug I either need more info on your system or you can prove that it _only_ happens with spacefm (does it?)

try #gentoo on freenode, the mailing list or the gentoo forums

i knew its not support forum.

and its definitelly bug, because i proved this by try a same file with following name: "dörfer.pdf". "ländlich.mp3".
 
in any cases: 

1) spacefm only START the application acroread and smplayer2, or what ever its the defaul assiged application for this file type, but not OPEN the file.

2) us tested with other filemanager: Dolphin, Thunar and there is no problem. the right programm start and also able open the file correctly.


3)According to the statement "...either need more info on your system..."
I am bug reporter my system is already posted on 1st comments.

if u need any ather information please give me an advice.

file a bug upstream https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/issues

I don't even know how you open those files, it could be a plugin, the default desktop file, a custom command even...

since I cannot reproduce this under the exact same locale I assume this is not related to my ebuild

1.) i dont have installed any plugins for spacefm.

2.)u can reproduce by rename any file and add this "ä" or "ö" or "ü" in the name of the file and try to open it. u will understand what i want to explain in my poor english :)

3.)on bugtrack of spacefm i didnt found hint about this.


hope u can reproduce it and confirm this bug to solve.

thanks

I did that and I was not able to reproduce.

I said "report a bug", not "look for hints".

If you can point me to the upstream bug about this issue or a way to reproduce, then I will reopen and even backport patches.

But neither of that has happened, so I am closing this until then.
