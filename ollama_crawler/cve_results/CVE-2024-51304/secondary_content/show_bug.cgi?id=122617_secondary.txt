!!! Digest verification Failed:
!!!    /usr/portage/distfiles/gmp-4.1.4.tar.bz2
!!! Reason: Failed on MD5 verification

failing mirrors (so far):

http://gentoo.osuosl.org/distfiles/gmp-4.1.4.tar.bz2
ftp://ftp.citylink.co.nz/gentoo/distfiles/gmp-4.1.4.tar.bz2
ftp://ftp.ring.gr.jp/pub/GNU/gmp/gmp-4.1.4.tar.bz2

I stopped checking mirrors after 3 found to be bad MD5.

Looks like it was just rsync in a race condition. I tested couple of those mirrors below and all checked out. It probably just fixed itself on the next subsequent sync.
