I have configuring my mpd with output pulse only and if I have dbus-1.12.16 installed the pulseaudio does not work. If I install dbus-1.12.12-r1 everything works perfectly...

These are some of my configuration files:

'/etc/mpd.conf':
audio_output {
        type            "pulse"
        name            "My Pulse Output"
        server          "192.168.1.10"
##      sink            "remote_server_sink"    # optional
}

'/etc/pulse/default.pa':
#load-module module-equalizer-sink
load-module module-dbus-protocol

'/var/lib/mpd/log':
Jun 25 22:45 : exception: Failed to open "My Pulse Output" (pulse)

well,for now I can't say what is exactlyt wrong, you need to debug pulseaudio first, also this is unclear what mpd version, have you tried upgrade/downgrade and so on.

I did again testing with dbus-1.12.16 and I did not find the error any more, I believe the error is random...

OK, I'll do the tests, then I'll report the result.

I did several tests in the last few days and everything worked out.
Thanks a lot for the help!
