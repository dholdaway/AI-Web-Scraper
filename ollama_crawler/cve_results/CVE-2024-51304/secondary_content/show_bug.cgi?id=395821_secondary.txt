This occurs when downloading from either www.cise.ufl.edu or mirrors.cs.wmich.edu... the file isn't present on ibiblio.org:

Please use our mirrors. There are upstreams around, which tend to alter the sources without bumps. This is one of the reasons why we provide the mirroring system.

This is a "WON'T FIX" bug. We will stable the next version and remove this one.

It looks like the other two sites I listed aren't (or are no longer) mirrors... but the Western Michigan University site is listed on http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/mirrors2.xml

Check here. ufconfig was cleanly fetched from upstream.

http://dev.gentoo.org/~zmedico/infra/distfiles/failure.xml

I checked all our mirrors there and they all give the same checksum. So please use our mirrors and your are fine.
