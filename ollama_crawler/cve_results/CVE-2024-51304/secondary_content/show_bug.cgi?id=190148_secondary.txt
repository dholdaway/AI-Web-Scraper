If one wants to build the OpenJDK on a system without X, that person is required to download a full JDK distribution to get 1400k of libraries.  It would be nice if it was possible to build the openjdk using the 800k (compressed) plugs distribution.

Reproducible: Always

Tool to decrypt the OpenJDK binary plugs

I reversed the classes in the Swing-based installer and wrote this tool to enable an X-less build.

source license is gpl 3.  normally I wouldn't license something so trivial under the gpl, but it took me several hours to reverse the classes and then understand what the installer was doing.

Usage:

Compile as normal.  The tool expects the file X_X from the plugs source in $PWD.  It should support all platforms supported by Sun (all the plugs are protected in the same way with the same key -- currently anyway).  It will decrypt X_X in-place, at which point the file X_X is just a standard zip archive.

This bug became obsolete by moving from openjdk to icedtea
