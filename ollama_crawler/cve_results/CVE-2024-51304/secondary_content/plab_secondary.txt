Photronics Reports Full Year and Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2023 Results


BROOKFIELD, Conn., Dec. 13, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Photronics, Inc. (NASDAQ:PLAB), a worldwide leader in
        photomask technologies and solutions, today reported financial results for its full year and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 ended October 31, 2023.
 
“We delivered our sixth consecutive year of record revenue with growth in fourth quarter amidst a prolonged industry downturn,” said Frank Lee, chief executive
        officer.  “Fourth quarter and full year revenue increased 8% year-over-year, and fourth quarter increased 1% sequentially.  Both IC and FPD increased, as demand for our design-driven products remained strong. Operating expenses were lower
        sequentially, partially offsetting lower gross profit, resulting in operating margins of 28.5% for the fourth quarter and 28.4% for the year.  Strong cash generation and our disciplined strategy of investing in growth strengthened the balance sheet
        while positioning us for sustained solid performance.  I am proud of our team’s performance and look forward to even greater achievements as we execute our strategy in the year to come.”

Forward-Looking Statements

Certain statements in this press release constitute “forward-looking statements” regarding our industry, our strategic position, and our financial and operating
        results.  These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially.  Please
          refer to the documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents contain and identify important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements.
          These certain factors can be found at www.photronics.com/riskfactors.  Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot
          guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this release to conform these statements to actual results.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Non-GAAP Net Income attributable to Photronics, Inc. shareholders and non-GAAP earnings per share, Free Cash Flow, and Net Cash are "non-GAAP financial measures" as
        such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission and may differ from similarly named non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The attached financial supplement reconciles Photronics, Inc. financial results under GAAP to
        non-GAAP financial information. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items are useful for analysts and investors to evaluate our future on-going performance because they enable a more meaningful comparison of our
        projected performance with our historical results. These non-GAAP metrics are not intended to represent funds available for our discretionary use and are not intended to represent, or be used as a substitute for, gross profit, operating income, net
        income, cash and cash equivalents, or cash flows from operations, as measured under GAAP. The items excluded from these non-GAAP metrics, but included in the calculation of their closest GAAP equivalent, are significant components of the condensed
        consolidated balance sheets and statement of cash flows and must be considered in performing a comprehensive assessment of overall financial performance. Please refer to the non-GAAP reconciliations on the following pages.






 
The following information was filed by Photronics Inc (PLAB) on Wednesday, December 13, 2023 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.

 Inside Photronics Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Should our revenue decrease as a result of a decrease in design releases from our customers, we may have excess or underutilized production capacity, which could significantly impact our operating margins, or result in write-offs from asset impairments.



 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure as discussed in the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section below, increased by $8.0 million in FY23, compared with FY22, and $121.2 million in FY22, compared with FY21, primarily due to increases in net cash provided by operating activities.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $27.0 million in FY23, compared with FY22, primarily due to increased net income and net cash-favorable changes in working capital, predominantly in Asia.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $18.5 million in Q4 FY23, compared with $21.3 million in Q3 FY23; the decrease was the result of a net decrease in the net incomes of our joint venture operations.

 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
Our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances were negatively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in FY23 by $2.7 million.
