My colleague just yesterday followed the guide to install sw raid with lvm. It did not work for him. These are two fixes needed:

Code Listing 2.9: Create the partitions
sda1 and sdb1 should be marked as Boot active, otherwise lilo does not boot

Code Listing 2.13: Mount the file systems
/dev should be also mounted to /mnt/gentoo/dev (mount -o bind /dev /mnt/gentoo/dev), otherwise lilo fails when running to update boot information

No, he did not. Stick to the guide, or be on your own.

I suppose you were in a hurry and so you did not bother to add an extra sentence saying in what my colleague deviated from the docs as I suppose you knew that. I found out later that the docs does not support lilo at all. So I suppose this bug is rather "invalid" than "worksforme" as I doubt it really works for you when using lilo.

Sorry to bother you with fix that might help unexperienced gentoo users to use even lilo for booting if they for some reason cannot/do not want to use grub. Up to that, I do not see anything correct in not marking bootable partition as active or not having the same /dev in chroot but that's just my point of view. I wonder why in gentoo handbook there are both these "unnecessary" steps included.
