gnome-icon-themes-3.12.0 as installed on my system does not provide compatibility links fore many icons, e.g folder.png

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 675 08-22 02:58 folder.png
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  10 10-04 22:12 gnome-fs-directory.png -> folder.png
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  10 10-04 22:20 gtk-directory.png -> folder.png
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  10 10-04 22:20 inode-directory.png -> folder.png
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  10 10-04 22:20 stock_folder.png -> folder.png

This makes (almost?) all gtk applications display text-x-generic instead of folder.png. There are probably more missing icons which I haven't spotted because I use GUI apps quite little.

To fix the problem /usr/libexec/icon-name-mapping should be used when the package is built.

Reproducible: Always

I have that icons installed:
# ls -l /usr/share/icons/gnome/16x16/places/gtk-directory.png
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 may 25 10:22 /usr/share/icons/gnome/16x16/places/gtk-directory.png -> folder.png


And, also, we are already building it with --enable-icon-mapping :/

Strange indeed. Rebuilding the package helped. I suppose there may have been a bug in icon-namig-utils at the time I was building the package for the first time. Anyway, things appear to work fine now. Thanks.

In my laptop I have "FEATURE=split-log" in my make.conf to save all build.logs in /var/log/portage/build/, that way all build.logs are saved there and I can see what did occur at build time (you will need to remember to clean them from time to time to not lose a lot of disk space of course ;))
