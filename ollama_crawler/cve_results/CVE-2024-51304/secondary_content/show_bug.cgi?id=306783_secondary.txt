libjpeg.so.62 was bumped to libjpeg.so.8.0.0 recently and broke sci-electronics/eagle because it's a binary package.

I guess a dependency needs to be added to eagle to pull in the older libjpeg.so.62 until the authors update it.

It already depend on jpeg-6*. I don't have any problems here. Show which error you got if any.
