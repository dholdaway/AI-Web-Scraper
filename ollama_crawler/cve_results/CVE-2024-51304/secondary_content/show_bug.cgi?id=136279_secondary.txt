Whenever thunderbird gets closed, it does not remove the .parentlock file in ~/.thunderbird/<BLABLA>.profile/ As a consequence, a message appears that TB is already running, whenever one starts thunderbid again.

Not here, is it closed gracefully?

Yes, there is no error message indicating a problem. I can close TB via CTRL-C or Menu->Quit or CTRL-Q always the same behaviour...

As I along with a few others are unable to duplicate the problems closing worksforme. You could try moving old profile out of way and testing to make sure it is not profile specific.

Hmm, kind-of "Windows(R)"-like problem-fixing, huh? ;-)
Could you give me a hint how I could hunt down the problem? I mean, I even don't get an error message or such-alike...
And removing the old profile is really NOT a "solution", because I have a quite huge local database of stored emails...

If you can not move the profile out of the way for testing purposes then there is nothing more I can do to assist ya with your problem.

Thanks for helping :).
I now moved the old profile away. Strangely, with the newly created profile, the .parentlock still does not get removed - but for some reasons thunderbird isn't bothered --> normal startup...
