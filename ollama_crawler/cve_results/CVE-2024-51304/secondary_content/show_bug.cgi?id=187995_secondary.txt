KMail regularily crashes with SIGFPE when I click on an IMAP folder. This does not happen everytime, but very often.

Which version of KMail are we talking about? 3.5.5? 3.5.7?

Your "emerge --info"?

The output of "emerge -pv kmail" (if you use the split email) or "emerge -pv kdepim" (if you use the monolithic ebuilds)?

Please re-open after providing the above information.

Please start by compiling kmail again without ccache. If that fails, try to build it with -debug and check whether kdelibs was built with debug or not - "qlist -IUv kdelibs" or "emerge -pv kdelibs".
As kde-3.5.7 is being currently marked stable by the arch teams, you might prefer to wait a few days and try the new version.

Currently, the problem is not reproducible anymore. I cannot say what I did to stop it. I was trying several changes to the KMail config, especially SSL/TLS-related ones, but none of them seemed to have any effect. Then, the problem suddenly stopped occuring. 
I am closing the bug for now and will report back if KMail starts crashing again.
