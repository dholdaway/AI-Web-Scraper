searching for any full name like www-apps/rt will not yield any results. in this special case, searching for rt results in 1283 hits, which is way too many to look through by hand.

if i only want to have info about a specific package, i would much prefer to just search for category/name and get the direct result

Try emerge --search ^rt$

I know this works, both with emerge and packages.gentoo.org. Still, using the full name is much more intuitive for users than using regexp.

Reassigning to the main infra group since Marduk is retired.

Full name is supported with the new packages2:
http://packages2.gentoo.org/packages/www-apps/rt
Actual searching to come later.
