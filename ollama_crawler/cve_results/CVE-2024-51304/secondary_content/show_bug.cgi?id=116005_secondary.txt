I don't know if this is intentional, but since the bugzilla upgrade I can no longer set the Assigned-To: field on new bugs, nor change it on my existing bugs.

Often I know who wants the bug (e.g. experimental ebuilds) and would rather save the wranglers the hassle of reassigning it.

Of course, if this is intentional I'll just shut up.

AFAIK this is nowadays intentional and it shouldn't be a duplicate of a "mixed" bug, which suggests this feature is an unsolved bug report.
