when I run "source /usr/bin/tsocks on" to use sshtunnel with ebuild
it export LD_PRELOAD, but it doesn't show in the ebuild process(echo in git2 eclass), only sandbox exists, tsocks missed.
Any solution?

Reproducible: Always

In the meantime, try this as workaround:

Thank you! But socksify in dante also uses LD_PRELOAD, so I don't think it can work.

Try running that source command in /etc/portage/bashrc.
