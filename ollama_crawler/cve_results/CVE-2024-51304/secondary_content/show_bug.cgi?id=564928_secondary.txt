I forgot to change my change my ssh-dss key in my dev box account to a rsa key as the news item warned:

OpenSSH 7.0 disables ssh-dss keys by default

So I am now locked out :(. Can I regain access?

Thanks for your support and sorry for the inconvenience.

It's your client locking you out, not the server. The news item you cited also contains the workaround.
