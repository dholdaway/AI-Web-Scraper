Description

While attempting to unpack the source for graphviz-1.16, the panic.patch is not recognized as a bzip2 
file, and does not extract. That means of course the patch can't be applied, and emerge fails.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge graphviz
Actual Results:  
* Cannot find $EPATCH_SOURCE! Value for $EPATCH_SOURCE is:
* /var/tmp/portage/graphviz-1.16/work/graphviz-1.16-panic.patch
* ( graphviz-1.16-panic.patch )

This message is arrived at because bzip2 failed to extract the patch to the above location.

Expected Results:  
Correct extraction of patch; successful build of graphviz

I am seeing this problem too. 'file' reports that the bz2 file is actually a
gzip file. Extracting it give the patch, but the patch itself appers to be
corrupted. It is binary and of course fails to apply. I am trying the other
versions in portage to see if I can get a newer version to compile. I'll let you
know if one of the others works for me.

The following commands let me install graphviz-2.4 successfully.

echo "freebsd-stat ~ppc-macos" >> /etc/portage/package.keywords
echo "=media-gfx/graphviz-2.4 ~ppc-macos" >> /etc/portage/package.keywords
emerge freebsd-stat graphviz

I hope this at least solves your immediate problem of getting graphviz
installed. Incidentally, freebsd-stat is required for this to build and yet is
not specified in the dependencies of graphviz-2.4.

Old bug, plus 2.8-r1 stable now.
