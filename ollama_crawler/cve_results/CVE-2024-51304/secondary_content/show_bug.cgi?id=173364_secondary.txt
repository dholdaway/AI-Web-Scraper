My first attempt to "emerge xorg-server" failed at the point where x11-libs/libXft-2.1.12 was being processed. Here are the last few lines:

====================================================================
/bin/sed: can't read /usr/lib/libxml2.la: No such file or directory
libtool: link: `/usr/lib/libxml2.la' is not a valid libtool archive

make: *** [all] Error 2

!!! ERROR: x11-libs/libXft-2.1.12 failed.

====================================================================

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:



Expected Results:  
I got around the problem by saying "emerge libxml2" and trying again with xorg-server. But I think the ebuild for libXft should acknowledge the package's dependence on libxml2 so that the latter can be in place before it's needed.

I am always impressed by the willingness of smart people to donate fixes to a setup that is already admirable. Thank you.

Uh, this doesn't reference libxml2 at all, anywhere in the code.

$ grep -Rni xml libXft-2.1.12/
$

You should run revdep-rebuild instead.
