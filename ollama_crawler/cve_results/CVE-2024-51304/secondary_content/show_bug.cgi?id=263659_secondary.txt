I guess this is upstream issue but I cannot find the bug, and before reporting it, I'd like someone from Gentoo devs to rule out the possibility that it is a Gentoo issue ...

Reproducible: Always

It is gentoo issue.
Try changing the sandbox version. Up/down what so ever, also what sandbox version you have?

ok, so I have tried downgrading sandbox versions down to 1.3.2 which is the oldest version required in kglobalaccel dependencies, and still the same result for all the versions
