I used heroxbd@g.o to subscribe to gentoo-project ML. But my emails sent to the list are dropped.

According to antarus, the mlmmj has accepted the message by rule #11 "allow". But somehow it is not delivered.

Reproducible: Always

You only subscribed at Fri Aug 30 17:43:56 2013. There have been no emails from your gentoo.org address after that point in time, only one from your gmail address which has been discarded as well.

That is because the rule-based filtering is applied before checking for subscription status. 

Conclusion: You should now be able to post using your gentoo.org address.
Should the problem still persists, reopen this bug.
