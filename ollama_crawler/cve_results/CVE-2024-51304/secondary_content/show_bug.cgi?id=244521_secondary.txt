Description

The translations of the GMN is usefull for the non-english speaking people.
But, when a non-english speaking people go on http://www.gentoo.org, he only see english text.
Then, in the article on the main page "The XXX issue of the Gentoo Monthly Newsletter has been released", it can be usefull to add : "The GMN is also available in German, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Spanish and Simplified Chinese".
Furthermore, the column about "Other languages" in the news letter is on the bottom of the page... Then, I suggest to put this column at the top of the news letter for avoid users to have to completely scroll down in order to find the link corresponding to their language.
It's maybe a way to have more readers and why not, more Gentoo users !

Reproducible: Always

Anant and I have discussed this previously (this bug may even be a dupe of another; still searching), and it didn't seem like something that needs changing, so I'll close it.

If the project lead has since reconsidered, then of course he'll open it again and make the changes. :)
