Description

I recently experienced some suprises (http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-1002894.html) after installing Gentoo with grub2 + nvidia and UEFI.

On the bootloader installation step (http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-amd64.xml?full=1#book_part1_chap10), I think that the Handbook should mention some practical kernel arguments such as nomodeset, etc.

Without the nomodeset argument, I was no able to see anything on my screen.

I believe this problem may be resolved with grub-2.02_beta2-r3.

maybe, in the kernel configuration, by set CONFIG_FB_SIMPLE=y, you can solve the problem, as I have experienced, but I'm not exactly sure is there anything else missed.

no further activity from the submitter. the bug is very old, and gentoo maintainers indicate it's been fixed in more recent bootloader versions.
