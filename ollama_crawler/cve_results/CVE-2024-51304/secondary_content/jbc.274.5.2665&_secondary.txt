Biol. Chem. 273, 13552–13562). We report here the identification and characterization of human OC-2, the second mammalian member of this class. TheOC-2 gene is located on human chromosome 18. The distribution of OC-2 mRNA in humans is tissue-restricted, the strongest …Save Cite Cited by 127 Related articles All 6 versions  PrivacyTermsHelpAbout ScholarSearch help
