ejabberd doesn't find mysql-module

tried it with:
* net-im/ejabberd-2.0.2-r1 (mod_irc mod_muc mod_pubsub odbc pam ssl web zlib -debug -ldap)
* dev-lang/erlang-12.2.5-r1 (hipe kpoll odbc sctp ssl -doc -emacs -java -smp -tk)

maybe the mysql-module is missing?

Reproducible: Always

I would hazard a guess that MySQL is supported through ODBC, so if you turned this into a request to add a direct MySQL client module, that would degrade the Severity of this bug to an Enhancement.

I agree with jer.  But, it may be able to work otherwise as well.  Can you provide a patch to the ebuild?  I'm happy to integrate it.

Markus if you need native mysql support, please, create patch, test it and attach here. I will include modules that our users need and use. Currently odbc works for me.
