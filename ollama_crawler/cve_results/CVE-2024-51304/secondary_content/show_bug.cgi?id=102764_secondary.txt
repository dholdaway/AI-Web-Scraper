After updating Mozilla and Galeon, I observe that the links in
/usr/lib/mozilla/plugins have been removed. Mozilla does not seem to require
them (it seems to find the plugins in /opt/netscape/plugins.

This might be a problem with the Mozilla or Galeon  ebuilds -- I don't really
know which. 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Ceate links in /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins pointing to plugins in
/opt/netscape/plugins
2. Emerge Mozilla and Galeon
3. Observe that the links are now missing. 

Actual Results:  
The links are missing, so Galeon will not find the plugins. 

Expected Results:  
Perhaps the Galeon emuild should create the links.

what version of mozilla as we add a patch so search /usr/lib/nsbrowser/plugins
which is were all plugins should be linked an installed to.

I only got flash working recently, so I don't know if it affected older
versions, however, it certainly affects the current stable (x86) builds: 
mozilla-1.7.11
galeon-1.3.21

you seems to have an older version of the initial build if you would re-emerge
mozilla after syncing your tree the new patch is include in the stable build and
will correct your problem. sorry for the inconvience. If that does not fix it we
can address the issue with Galeon about looking in same locations that mozilla
is looking for them.

No response here, closing. Reopen if it's still an issue.
