In the shared-mime-info-0.21-r1 i got an error of autoconf versione

to solve this, eautomake should be changed in eautoreconf (thx to seemant for help)

Reproducible: Always

***** automake *****
 
aclocal.m4:17: error: this file was generated for autoconf 2.61.
You have another version of autoconf.  If you want to use that,
you should regenerate the build system entirely.
aclocal.m4:17: the top level
autom4te-2.60: /usr/bin/m4 failed with exit status: 63
automake-1.10: autoconf failed with exit status: 63

Sorry i thought I paste it.

I am using just stable package..

So upgrade your autoconf to 2.61.

Eric,

please post your emerge --info and the log for the emerge.
I can also emerge share-mime-info-0.22 with autoconf-2.61-r1.

I just ran into this on a fresh system, I changed eautomake to eautoreconf, and it solved the autoconf version problem, HOWEVER, I ran into the XML:Parser problem after that.  I have the latest version os autoconf installed (2.61), I also tried 0.22 for shared-mime-info.

Anyway, I solved that problem by remerging XML-Parser and intltool, then and only then did shared-mime-info rebuild.

Any ideas why this happened?

Please check your emerge logs as I suspect you updated expat and didn't run revdep-rebuild to fix the broken links.

Luca,

can you please confirm if your issue was caused by an updated expat?

Great, so one guy has outdated autoconf and the other failed to run revdep-rebuild... Why's this bug open?
