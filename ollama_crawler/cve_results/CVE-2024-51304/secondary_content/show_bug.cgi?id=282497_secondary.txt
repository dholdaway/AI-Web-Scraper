You should ask on the forums (maybe in the French section if you are not confortable with english) and read emerge's man.

Needs gstreamer, not something we want to force upon users that have USE="alsa" enabled. Feel free to add it to your world file so --depclean won't remove it.

> p7zip

Unrelated to Xfce4.

> icon
> themes
> and more

Only hicolor-icon-theme is required for running, everything else is optional.
Try tango-icon-theme for example.
