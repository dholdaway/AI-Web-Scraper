I had to upgrade my machine to the -9999 builds of eudev/openrc to get my computer to shutdown properly. OpenRC was always reporting (xdm waiting on xdm-setup) or (waiting on udev, etc...) it would always stall out and never really shutdown appropriately. I can always switch back to the old OpenRC/eudev to give you guys logs, but I think this might be worth mentioning. 

4.17.x would not work with OpenRC 0.38.1 / eudev-3.2.5. I only did some basic log investigation and only saw the complaints, nothing that reported anything with any great insight. I can provide further information upon request.

It is sad to read that you have problems with the software. The situation seems to be a bit more complicate and requires some analysis.
We can not help you efficiently via bug tracker. The bug tracker aims rather on specific problems in .ebuilds and less on individual systems. 

I have had very good experience on the gentoo IRC [1] with questions like this. Of course there are also forums and mailing lists [2,3].
I hope you understand, that I will close the bug here therefore and wish you good luck on one of the mentioned channels [4].

Please create a new ticket in order to provide an indication for an specific error in an ebuild or any gentoo related product.

Provide a full set of information in the new ticket. 
Please recompile and *attach* the logfiles and 
paste the emerge info as described on
https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Attach_the_logs_to_the_bug_ticket
The logs must be part of the ticket, but not on external websites.
