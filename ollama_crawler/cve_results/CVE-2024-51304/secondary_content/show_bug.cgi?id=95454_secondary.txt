jzlib ebuild fails because the file
http://www.jcraft.com/jzlib/jzlib-1.0.5.tar.gz is no longer available for download.

A new version jzlib-1.0.6.tar.gz is now available.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge jzlib
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
failed to download file jzlib-1.0.5.tar.gz from
http://www.jcraft.com/jzlib/jzlib-1.0.5.tar.gz

Expected Results:  
should download new version jzlib-1.0.6.tar.gz

A work around is to create an overlay package and emerge with the following steps:
1. echo "PORTDIR_OVERLAY=\"/usr/local/portage\"" > /etc/make.conf [if not
already set]
2. mkdir /usr/local/portage/dev-java
3. cp /usr/portage/dev-java/jzlib /usr/local/portage/dev-java/jzlib
4. cp /usr/portage/dev-java/jzlib/jzlib-1.0.5.ebuild
/usr/local/portage/dev-java/jzlib/jzlib-1.0.6.ebuild
5. ebuild /usr/local/portage/dev-java/jzlib/jzlib-1.0.6.ebuild digest
6. emerge jzlib
