 Inside Us Foods Holding Corp.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Income   Highlight
Our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, vendor consideration and income taxes.



 Financial - Income   Highlight
To the extent we prevail in matters for which an uncertain tax position has been established, or pay amounts in excess of recorded positions, our effective income tax rate could be materially affected.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
The decrease in other income—net in 2023 is primarily due to a decrease in the expected return on assets and the value of pension assets compared to fiscal year 2022.

 Other - Other   Highlight
We adjust the amounts recorded for uncertain tax positions when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Our uncertain tax positions contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment in estimating the exposures associated with our various filing positions.
