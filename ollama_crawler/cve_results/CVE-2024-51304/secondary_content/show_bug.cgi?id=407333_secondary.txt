Hi.

When emerging now stable version of zlib: zlib-1.2.5-r2 it tries to download zlib-1.2.5.tar.bz2 from zlib.com. There is only zlib-1.2.6 version now. So it would be more correct to download from sourceforge.  http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/libpng/zlib/1.2.5/zlib-1.2.5.tar.bz2
Or somewhere else where all versions are stored.

!!! Couldn't download 'zlib-1.2.5.tar.bz2'. Aborting.

Confirmed, but why don't you try one of our fine mirrors?

Thank you for a quick reply. I have looked through and have found that it was my mistake. I have missed one charecter in the gentoo mirror address and emerge was telling me that there is no file at the mirror. Oops.

Still as soon as zlib.net is a fallback option it should work too :) I think!
