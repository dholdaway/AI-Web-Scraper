Exhibit 99.1News ReleaseCommunity Healthcare Trust Announces Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 FRANKLIN, Tenn., February 14, 2023 / PRNewswire / -- Community Healthcare Trust Incorporated (NYSE: CHCT) (the "Company") today announced results for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The Company reported net income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 of approximately $5.2 million, or $0.19 per diluted common share. Funds from operations ("FFO") and adjusted funds from operations ("AFFO") for the three months ended December 31, 2022 totaled $0.56 and $0.63, respectively, per diluted common share.  Highlights include:•During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company acquired 13 real estate properties for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $50.2 million. Upon acquisition, the properties totaling approximately 241,000 square feet, were 97.8% leased in the aggregate with lease expirations through 2034.•Subsequent to December 31, 2022, the Company acquired three real estate properties totaling approximately 99,000 square feet for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $12.5 million. Upon acquisition, the properties were 100.0% leased with lease expirations through 2029.•The Company has four properties under definitive purchase agreements for an expected aggregate purchase price of approximately $20.1 million. The Company's expected aggregate return on these investments ranges from approximately 9.2% to 9.5%. The Company expects to close on these properties during the first half of 2023; however, the Company cannot provide assurance as to the timing of when, or whether, these transactions will actually close. •The Company also has six properties under definitive purchase agreements, to be acquired after completion and occupancy, for an aggregate expected purchase price of approximately $141.0 million. The Company's expected returns on these investments are approximately 10.25%. The Company anticipates closing on these properties throughout 2023 and 2024; however, the Company cannot provide assurance as to the timing of when, or whether, these transactions will actually close.•During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company issued, through its at-the-market offering program, 600,000 shares of common stock at an average gross sales price of $34.94 per share and received net proceeds of approximately $20.5 million at an approximate 5.02% current equity yield.•On December 14, 2022, the Company amended its credit agreement, adding a new seven-year three-month, $150.0 million term loan (the “A-5 Term Loan”), which matures on March 14, 2030, and replaced the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”) as a benchmark interest rate for loans under the Credit Agreement with the secured overnight financing rate administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (“SOFR”). Proceeds of the A-5 Term Loan were used to repay a $50.0 million term loan with a March 29, 2024 maturity, and to repay $85.0 million aggregate principal amount of loans outstanding under the existing revolving credit facility, with the balance of the proceeds used to fund acquisitions. On December 19, 2022, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements that fixed the interest rate on the A-5 Term Loan and in January 2023, we transitioned our interest rate swap rates from LIBOR to SOFR.•On February 9, 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend in the amount of $0.4475 per share. The dividend is payable on March 1, 2023 to stockholders of record on February 21, 2023.1The following information was filed by Community Healthcare Trust Inc (CHCT) on Tuesday, February 14, 2023 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.

 Inside Community Healthcare Trust Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Expense   Highlight
However, recent inflation has significantly increased and a prolonged period of high and persistent inflation could cause an increase in our expenses, capital expenditures, and cost of our variable-rate borrowings which could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.



 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately $1.9 million, or 6.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 due mainly to the following: Depreciation and amortization related to properties acquired during 2022 and 2021 accounted for an increase of approximately $2.8 million; Real estate intangible assets acquired prior to 2021 that became fully depreciated resulted in a decrease of approximately $1.6 million; and Depreciation related to tenant and other improvements accounted for an increase of approximately $0.7 million.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre The Company uses the NAREIT definition of EBITDAre which is net income plus interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization, plus losses or minus gains on the disposition of depreciable property, including losses/gains on change of control, plus impairment write-downs of depreciable property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciable property in the affiliate, plus or minus adjustments to reflect the entity's share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates and consolidated affiliates with non-controlling interest.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Tenant Improvements and Capital Improvements The Company may provide tenant improvement allowances in new or renewal leases for the purpose of refurbishing or renovating tenant space.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Higher interest rates imposed by the Federal Reserve to address inflation may adversely impact real estate asset values and increase our interest expense on our variable-rate borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
