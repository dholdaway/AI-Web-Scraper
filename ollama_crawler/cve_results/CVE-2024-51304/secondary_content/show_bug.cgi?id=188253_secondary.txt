I've been using gdb trying to debug bug 188249. I could not get hardware watchpoints to work. I got a message that a hardware breakpoint was used, and the same line was repeaded several times while the program was running, but when it hit some other breakpoint, the watched value had changed and the watchpoint had never caused the debugger to break the program. The hardware is a Intel P4 Prescott with hyper threading.

I'm trying to construct a simple testcase to reproduce this issue, but so far I'm failing miserably. I even can't reproduce it in my original scenario, at least as far as I remember the steps I'd taken then.

I'm resolving this as WORKSFORME until I can come up with a sample case. Sorry.
