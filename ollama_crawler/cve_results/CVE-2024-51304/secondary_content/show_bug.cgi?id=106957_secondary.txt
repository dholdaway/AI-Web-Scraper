Description

Motherboard ASUS P4P800, intergrated Ethernet controller: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. 
Yukon Gigabit Ethernet 10/100/1000Base-T Adapter (rev 13).
After change in kernel driver from obsolete CONFIG_SK98LIN to new CONFIG_SKGE and start 
vmware, in syslog appears lines:
Unknown EII protocol 0806: csum at 64362
Unknown EII protocol 0806: csum at 34474
and more, more, more.
I grep this string in source of kernel and binary modules and find it in vmnet.o.
Then i untar vmnet.tar and comment this line in bridge.c, rename vmnet.tar to vmnet.tar.old, 
tar new vmnet.tar, run vmware-config.pl, /etc/init.d/vmware start and all ok.
But this step is not good idea, because i'm not undestand cause of problem.                         
Same decision i detect in http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-340588-highlight-unknown+eii.
html

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. change driver ethernet controller from CONFIG_SK98LIN to CONFIG_SKGE and make kernel
2. reboot
3. /etc/init.d/vmware start

Actual Results:  
lines "Unknown EII protocol 0806: csum at xxx" in syslog

Expected Results:  
no lines "Unknown EII protocol 0806: csum at xxx" in syslog

Well, it would seem to be something driver-specific, no?

Can anyone verify that this is still an issue with newer kernels?

So this is no longer an issue?
