Description

manually cleaning up the system because I was running out of hard drive space in /var/log and found that acpid logfile does not get rotated by logrotate because there is no configuration file in /etc/logrotate.d/acpid

$ equery files acpid
* Contents of sys-power/acpid-1.0.4-r1:
/etc
/etc/acpi
/etc/acpi/default.sh
/etc/acpi/events
/etc/acpi/events/default
/etc/init.d
/etc/init.d/acpid
/usr
/usr/bin
/usr/bin/acpi_listen
/usr/sbin
/usr/sbin/acpid
/usr/share
/usr/share/doc
/usr/share/doc/acpid-1.0.4-r1
/usr/share/doc/acpid-1.0.4-r1/Changelog.gz
/usr/share/doc/acpid-1.0.4-r1/README.gz
/usr/share/doc/acpid-1.0.4-r1/TODO.gz
/usr/share/man
/usr/share/man/man8
/usr/share/man/man8/acpi_listen.8.gz
/usr/share/man/man8/acpid.8.gz

A simple fix would be to check if logrotate is installed, and if so, include a file containing the lines below (or I wonder if this should be included with logrotate???):

# rotate /var/log/acpid
/var/log/acpid {
  missingok
  notifempty
  size=64k
  postrotate
  /etc/init.d/acpid restart >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
  endscript
}
