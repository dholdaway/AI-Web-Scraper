Open Government/Public Records
The Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (FLHSMV) provides information throughout its website, including online driver license and motor vehicle checks. Other reports such as driver histories, motor vehicle histories and crash reports can be ordered. FLHSMV maintains the Florida driver license, motor vehicle and related databases, which are queried and updated as citizens are issued licenses and registrations at the more than 400 locations throughout the state.

FLHSMV Organization – Want to learn more about how FLHSMV’s team is organized, view the FLHSMV’s organizational chart.
Budget – How does FLHSMV spend taxpayer money? The budget for the current fiscal year can be viewed at Transparency Florida’s website.
Purchasing — The Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (FLHSMV) strives to be a leader among state agencies by creating sound business relationships with Florida businesses that support economic growth and development, and provide opportunities for Certified Minority Business Enterprises (CMBEs).  The FLHSMV is committed to working with minority businesses both directly and via subcontracting opportunities, particularly those providing goods and services aligned with our public safety mission.  To become a CMBE, please the Department of Management Services website for further information.
Fiscal Impact —  FLHSMV provides highway safety and security through excellence in service, education and enforcement. FLHSMV’s work positively impacts nearly every Floridian in a variety of ways that includes helping other state and local agencies with resources that contribute to essential services for the people of Florida.
Legislative Budget Request – To plan for the next fiscal year, each state agency submits a proposed budget to the Florida Legislature. State legislators use these requests to draft and approve a budget each year. Visit Transparency Florida’s website to view our legislative budget request for the next fiscal year.
Legislative Priorities – Like FLHSMV’s legislative budget request, the department submits its legislative priorities to the Florida Legislature. These priorities include new or proposed changes to Florida laws that are important to motorists in Florida and are an improvement to processes impacting customers.
Public Records – Need to make a public records request? Florida’s public records laws are very broad, and most records are available to the public. However, the laws exempt specific personal information contained in a motor vehicle record from public disclosure requirements. A motor vehicle record includes driver licenses, titles, registrations and identification cards issued by FLHSMV. There is a copy cost of 15 cents per page, unless provided otherwise by statute, and the extensive use of clerical or supervisory time (in excess of 30 minutes) may result in added labor costs. All costs must be paid in advance of providing copies, unless other satisfactory arrangements are made.
For purposes of the notice requirements of section 119.12(1)(b), Florida Statutes, the contact information for the department’s custodian of public records is:
