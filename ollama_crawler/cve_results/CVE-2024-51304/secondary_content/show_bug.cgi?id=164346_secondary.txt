sys-kernel/linux-headers-2.6.19.2-r2 can't be installed because a file is missing on the mirrors.

This is what I'm getting from every mirror I've tried:

>>> Emerging (2 of 12) sys-kernel/linux-headers-2.6.19.2-r2 to /
>>> Downloading 'http://distfiles.gentoo.org/distfiles/gentoo-headers-2.6.19.2-3.tar.bz2'
--05:53:07--  http://distfiles.gentoo.org/distfiles/gentoo-headers-2.6.19.2-3.tar.bz2
           => `/usr/portage/distfiles/gentoo-headers-2.6.19.2-3.tar.bz2'
Resolving distfiles.gentoo.org... 64.50.236.52, 64.50.238.52, 216.165.129.135, ...
Connecting to distfiles.gentoo.org|64.50.236.52|:80... connected.
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 404 Not Found
05:53:07 ERROR 404: Not Found.

Because the mirror ftp://lug.mtu.edu always times out (a bug is already reported) I only could try to fetch the above file from the mirrors to which portage connects before ftp://lug.mtu.edu.

i checked and it's in the system.  it should just be a matter of time for the mirrors to pick it up.

for the impatient, look here:
