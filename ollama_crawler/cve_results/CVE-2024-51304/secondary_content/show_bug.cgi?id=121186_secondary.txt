xsane
xsane: error while loading shared libraries: libusb-0.1.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

emerge libusb
... emerge successful, but ...

xsane
xsane: error while loading shared libraries: libusb-0.1.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

ls /usr/lib/libusb*
/usr/lib/libusb-0.1.so.4.4.0
/usr/lib/libusb-0.1.so.4.4.2
/usr/lib/libusb-0.1.so.4

A quick hack:
ln -s /usr/lib/libusb-0.1.so.4 /usr/lib/libusb-0.1.4
fixes this.

xsane 0.9.7
libusb 0.1.10.a
libtool 1.5.22

It's not that easy... on my system:
 # equery files libusb
[ Searching for packages matching libusb... ]
dev-libs/libusb-0.1.10a
* Contents of dev-libs/libusb-0.1.10a:
/usr
/usr/bin
/usr/bin/libusb-config
/usr/include
/usr/include/usb.h
/usr/include/usbpp.h
/usr/lib
/usr/lib/libusb -> libusb-0.1.4.4.2
/usr/lib/libusb-0.1.4 -> libusb-0.1.4.4.2
/usr/lib/libusb-0.1.4.4.2
/usr/lib/libusb.a
/usr/lib/libusb.la
[more files snipped]
Will have to check what makes the difference.

Upgraded libtool, re-emerged libusb, got different files in /usr/lib... no idea why this was changed. But just re-emerging sane-backends fixed the issue for me. So I'd say this is not an xsane or sane-backends issue but a problem with libtool and/or libusb. Re-assigning to the libusb maintainer, please check if this is your problem.

yes, i've seen this before,. its a libtool/libusb interaction thing. we already run libtoolize in 0.10.0a and it seems to take care of it. can't find out where exactly is the culprit for this transient failure.
