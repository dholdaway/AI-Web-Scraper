When doing updates or newinstalling of packages it would be useful if emerge could  do anything optional on exit like playing a sound to make you aware that it failed emerging or it has finished

What do you think?

The exit status already provides the required functionality.  You can create a wrapper script if you want like this (save it as /usr/local/bin/emerge or something):

#!/usr/bin/env bash
/usr/lib/portage/bin/emerge && aplay success.wav || aplay failure.wav

Oops, forgot to pass the args to emerge...

#!/usr/bin/env bash
/usr/lib/portage/bin/emerge "$@" && aplay success.wav || aplay failure.wav

But that will make emerge always playing sounds on exit even when I make emerge -s foobar or emerge -pv world which might not be preferable all times

Call the script something different (besides emerge) and only use it when you want sound.

for your .bashrc:
semerge() { emerge "$@" && aplay success.wav || aplay failure.wav ; }
