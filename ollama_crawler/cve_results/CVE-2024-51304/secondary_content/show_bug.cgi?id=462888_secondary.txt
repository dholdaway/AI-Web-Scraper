After upgrading to dev-lisp/md5-2.0.1, clsql can no longer authenticate with a postgresql-9.2 instance using md5 authentication. Rolling back to md5-1.8.5 fixes the issue.

I haven't dug any deeper yet, other than diffing the two versions. There are a LOT of differences.

No errors are thrown. Postgresql simply rejects the md5 hash. It must be a different hash than that which md5-1.8.5 generates, and which postgres understands.

Reproducible: Always

Apparently, there is a mess of md5 implementations out there:

http://www.cliki.net/MD5

As pointed out in http://www.cliki.net/CL-MD5 , there is a difference between these implementations.

Recently bumped =dev-lisp/hunchentoot-1.2.15 needs MD5SUM-STRING not present in md5-1.8.5.

We'll have to sort all this in the lisp overlay.

Besides, clsql-6.4.0 is out:

http://clsql.b9.com/download.html

I'll work on this in the following days.

Thanks for reporting.

I've been able to connect to a postgresql database configured with md5 method of authentication with =dev-lisp/clsql-5.4.0 and dev-lisp/md5-2.0.1. I am able to connect, get database status, list tables an disconnect, so I think the connection is ok.

Are you using some other packages or scenarios in your installation?

BTW, I've pushed =dev-lisp/clsql-6.4.0 to the lisp overlay in case you want to give it a try.

No answer in more than one year. Closing.
