The /etc/init.d/boinc script fails to start because start-stop-daemon won't recognize option '--stdout'. I'm using the latest stable version of baselayout.
Sorry for being unable to try with newer unstable versions of baselayout as I'm not going to have an access to my Gebtoo box for a while.

Reproducible: Always

This is already fixed in cvs, now boinc detect if run with baselayout-1 or baselayout-2
