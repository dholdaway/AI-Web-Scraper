cdparanoia-3.9.8-r3 works, -r5 doesn't.

My system, dmesg:

...
libata version 2.00 loaded.
ata_piix 0000:00:1f.2: version 2.00
ata_piix 0000:00:1f.2: MAP [ P0 P2 IDE IDE ]
...
ata2: PATA max UDMA/100 cmd 0x170 ctl 0x376 bmdma 0x18B8 irq 15
scsi1 : ata_piix
ata2.00: ATAPI, max UDMA/33
ata2.00: configured for UDMA/33
  Vendor: HL-DT-ST  Model: DVDRAM GMA-4082N  Rev: HA01
  Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 05
...

with /dev/cdrom -> sr0 and no SCSI generic.

With -r3:

Checking /dev/cdrom for cdrom...
        DMA scatter/gather table entries: 1
        table entry size: 102400 bytes
        maximum theoretical transfer: 43 sectors
        Setting default read size to 24 sectors (56448 bytes).

CDROM model sensed sensed: HL-DT-ST DVDRAM GMA-4082N HA01 

Checking for SCSI emulation...
        Drive is ATAPI (using SCSI host adaptor emulation)

Checking for MMC style command set...
        Drive is MMC style
Verifying CDDA command set...
        Expected command set reads OK.

With -r5:

/dev/cdrom exists but isn't accessible.  By default,
cdparanoia stops searching for an accessible drive here.
Consider using -sv to force a more complete autosense
of the machine.

More information about /dev/cdrom:
Checking /dev/cdrom for cdrom...
        Testing /dev/cdrom for cooked ioctl() interface
                /dev/sr0 is not a cooked ioctl CDROM.
        Testing /dev/cdrom for SCSI interface
                No generic SCSI device found to match CDROM device /dev/sr0

Load the sg driver, SG_IO has bad behaviour on real SCSI and some pata drivers, and it's not maintained officially, so it has been removed from -r5.
