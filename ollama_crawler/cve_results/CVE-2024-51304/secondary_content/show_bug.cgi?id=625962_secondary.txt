emerge --info

Starting a VM with "vboxmanage startvm iwplayerqa --type headless" results in the following output:

Waiting for VM "iwplayerqa" to power on...
VBoxManage: error: The virtual machine 'iwplayerqa' has terminated unexpectedly during startup with exit code 1 (0x1)
VBoxManage: error: Details: code NS_ERROR_FAILURE (0x80004005), component MachineWrap, interface IMachine

Works fine when I downgrade to 5.1.22.

Why do you think this is a bug in the ebuild and not from the upstream source?

I'm not confident it isn't, but wasn't sure where to start. It doesn't happen in 5.1.26 either so I'm fine with closing this one out.
