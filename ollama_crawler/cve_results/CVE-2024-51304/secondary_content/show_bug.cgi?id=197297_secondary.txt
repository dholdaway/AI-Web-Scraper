Description

The java software pauker isn't actually a game, so I request to move this package to the sci-misc section. Pauker is a flashcard trainer and I don't see why this ended up in games-puzzle...

Reproducible: Always

the section isn't all that important.  Unless the science group really wants this package, I don't prefer to move it.
