NEWS RELEASE
 PATTERSON COMPANIES REPORTS FISCAL 2024 
FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR END OPERATING RESULTS   


 

 
 Fourth quarter reported net sales increased 0.1 percent year-over-year to $1.72 billion, and
internal sales decreased 0.5 percent.   


 

 
 Fourth quarter internal sales benefitted from strong growth in production animal as well as dental consumables
growth of 3.7 percent year-over-year.   


 

 
 Returned $327.9 million to shareholders in fiscal 2024 through dividends and share repurchases.
  


 

 
 Delivered fourth quarter GAAP earnings of $0.74 per diluted share and adjusted earnings1 of $0.82 per diluted share; both GAAP and adjusted earnings1 were negatively impacted by $0.04 per diluted share due to the cybersecurity attack
on Change Healthcare.   


 

 
 Achieved fiscal 2024 GAAP earnings of $1.98 per diluted share and adjusted earnings of $2.30 per diluted
share.   


 

 
 Issues fiscal 2025 GAAP earnings guidance of $2.00 to $2.10 per diluted share and adjusted earnings1 guidance of $2.33 to $2.43 per diluted share.  St. Paul, Minn. 
June 18, 2024  Patterson Companies, Inc. (Nasdaq: PDCO) today reported operating results for its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter ended April 27, 2024. 
Throughout fiscal 2024, Patterson navigated a challenging market environment while continuing to make progress on our strategic objectives to better
position the organization for the future, said Don Zurbay, President and CEO of Patterson Companies. Our fourth quarter results were driven by strong performances in our dental consumables and production animal businesses, reflecting the
strength of Pattersons value proposition across our resilient end markets and our sustained focus on serving as indispensable partners to our customers. Our outlook reflects the continued confidence in our strategy focused on investing to
drive enhanced growth and profitability over the long term combined with the current conditions in our end markets.  Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024
Results  Consolidated net sales were $1.72 billion (see attached Sales Summary for further details), an increase of 0.1 percent compared to
the same period last year. Internal sales, which are adjusted for the effects of currency translation and the net impact of an interest rate swap, decreased 0.5 percent over the prior year period. 
Reported net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 was $67.0 million, or $0.74 per diluted share,
compared to $75.0 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Adjusted net income1 attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc., which excludes deal amortization,
totaled $74.4 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, or $0.82 per diluted share, compared to $82.4 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The year-over-year decrease in reported and adjusted net
income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 is primarily due to lower sales of equipment and the negative impact of the widely reported cybersecurity attack on vendor partner, Change Healthcare, within the
value-added services category of the dental segment. Both reported and adjusted net income in the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter were negatively impacted by $0.04 per diluted share due to the cybersecurity attack on Change Healthcare. 
Patterson Dental  Reported net sales in the Dental
segment for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 were $657.8 million. Internal sales decreased 3.8 percent compared to the fiscal 2023 fourth quarter. Internal sales of consumables increased 3.7 percent year-over-year. Excluding the
deflationary impact of certain infection control products, internal sales of consumables increased 4.4 percent year-over-year. Compared to the prior year period, internal sales of equipment decreased 11.9 percent. Internal sales of
value-added services decreased 11.0 percent compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the negative impact of the cybersecurity attack on Change Healthcare.

 Inside Patterson Companies, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Cost inflation and higher interest rates may affect our customer's willingness to invest in capital equipment and could impact our customers' volume of purchases.



 Other - Other   Highlight
Patterson has adopted various accounting policies to prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Management believes that our policies are conservative and our philosophy is to adopt accounting policies that minimize the risk of adverse events having a material impact on recorded assets and liabilities.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Cost inflation increased certain operating costs, and Patterson has implemented price increases in response; however, cost inflation did not materially impact our net results of operations in fiscal 2024.

 Other - Other   Highlight
The financial performance and condition of Patterson may also be materially impacted by transactions and events that we have not previously experienced and for which we have not been required to establish an accounting policy or adopt a generally accepted accounting principle.

 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
Cash flows could be impaired if our financial strength diminishes to a level that precluded us from taking part in this facility or other similar facilities.
