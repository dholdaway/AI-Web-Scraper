Description

After installing mailgraph-1.14 with the vhosts USE flag set, the user has to run webapp-config to install the application into the vhost:

  webapp-config -I mailgraph 1.14 -h myhost -d mailgraph

Also a ScriptAlias line is required in the vhost config:

  ScriptAlias /mailgraph "/var/www/myhost/cgi-bin/mailgraph.cgi"

Neither of these things are mentioned in the post-install notes, but they should be.

I forgot to mention that the configuration that I suggested (which is pretty common for webapps as I understand it), mailgraph doesn't work well.

The cgi refers to itself for the images. With a directory for the scriptalias, mailgraph won't work if no slash (/) is provided at the end of the url:
it somehow ends up trying to access /var/www/myhost/htdocs/mailgraph.cgi instead of /var/www/myhost/cgi-bin/mailgraph.cgi.

So http://myhost/mailgraph/ works while http://myhost/mailgraph doesn't.

I cannot reproduce this (the ending-slash part).  Please reopen if it is still relevant.
