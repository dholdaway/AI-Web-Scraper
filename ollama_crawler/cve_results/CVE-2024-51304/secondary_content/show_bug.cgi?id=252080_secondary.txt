When trying to make others aware of a bug and progress related to a bug, the show_bug.cgi form provides the following sample instructions:

===
[X] Add reporter's email to CC List

Only users in all of the selected groups can view this bug:
(Unchecking all boxes makes this a more public bug.)

[X] Group name

Only members of a group can change the visibility of a bug for that group

Users in the roles selected below can always view this bug:
(The assignee can always see a bug, and this section does not take effect unless the bug is restricted to at least one group.)

[X] Reporter [X] CC List
===

When the a gentoo bug is submited using bugzilla according to category, Group name is force checked, and the instruction to uncheck all boxes intuitively applies to Reporter and CC List. If a user wants a bug to be "more public", he follows the instructions as interpreted above. However, when such instruction is followed, the bug becomes inaccessible to the reporter.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Submit a bug report.
2. Search for and view your bug in the bugzilla interface.
3. Look for the group section beneath the additional info box and uncheck the following boxes:
[ ] Add reporter's email to CC list
[ ] Reporter [ ] CC List

Actual Results:  
The reporter is denied ability to view bug

Expected Results:  
The reporter can still view his bug, or a less terse / ambiguous phrasing of the bugzilla interface above.

Err, it says clearly " Users in the roles selected below can always view this bug:". If you went and unchecked the "Reporter" or "CC" boxes, then it's your fault. The whole situation with "UserRel" product is tricky for various reasons. I don't believe that there is something we can fix here. I understand your engrossment, and thank you for reporting this, anyway. I will assign this to bugzilla@ . 

@infra: Mark says here that when he reported a bug with product "User Relations"   and component User/Developer issues, he had the choice via button unchecking, to deny access to himself(reporter) and to any CC list. See bug #251931 , bug #252102 and my own test, in bug #252394 where I ended with access denied to both my pchrist at gentoo.org and pchrist_ at hol.gr accounts. I cannot understand why a reporter should have that choice/power. Probably it's a bugzilla limitation, so RESOLVED CANTFIX?

The observed behavior is still present.
However, the checkboxes are clearly labelled, and should a user untick those by mistake, userrel can easily add them again.

All in all, I reckon there is nothing to "fix" here.
