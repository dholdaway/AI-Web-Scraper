Signing an e-mail works fine but generates the following warning:

gpg: "-sat" won't generate clear signed messages in future versions
gpg: Use "--clearsign" instead of "-sat"

The gnupg version installed is app-crypt/gnupg-2.0.7-r1

I cannot reproduce this with gnupg-2.0.17.  Please reopen if it is still a problem.
