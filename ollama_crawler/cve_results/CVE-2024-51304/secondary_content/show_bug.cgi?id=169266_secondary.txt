Ticho,

Trying to track down what might be missing for the test suite. Despite the obvious, this module only parses the headers of an svg (vs actually loading it) so i believe it might be something simpler than media-libs/libsvg.

The package now builds and passes testsuite on both my stable boxes - laptop and a headless server. Closing bug and thanks for patience.
