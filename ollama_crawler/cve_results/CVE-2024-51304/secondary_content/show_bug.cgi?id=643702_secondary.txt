The file libpq-fe.h is present. 

# equery f  postgresql | grep libpq-fe.h
/usr/include/postgresql-9.4/libpq-fe.h

Can you please run "eselect postgresql" and re-select your desired slot? There was a period where the postgres symlinks could get messed up, leading to applications (like PHP) not being able to find the right libraries.

Afterwards, PHP should build successfully (we hope).

There's a new version app-eselect/eselect-postgresql-2.3 that's supposed to fix these issues once and for all. Please let us know if this is still a problem after re-eselecting your postgres version.
