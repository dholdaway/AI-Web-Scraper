The current handbook says nothing about performing an "eselect locale set" in order to set the system locale.  This step should be included right after the one for performing "locale-gen."

that only sets LANG, which shouldn't be needed at that point. we have a whole separate utf-8 guide for managing all the various things one might need to do with system locales & languages.
