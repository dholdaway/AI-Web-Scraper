eselect compiler doesn't work! when I switch compiler with it gcc-config output doesn't change. gcc -v changes but some other links are not changed. It results in problem while compiling glibc :"tls support is required". After changing with gcc-config it builds correct.

Please specify the installed version of both app-admin/eselect and app-admin/eselect-compiler.

eselect version 1.0 eselect-compiler 20051017 (latest from portage)

are you using gcc-config-2?  That's the version that is the frontend to eselect compiler.  eselect-compiler does not use the old config files.

My problem:
1) I installed gcc 4.1.0
2) I changed compiler to gcc 4.1.0 by eselect compiler
3) When compiling glibc I get: "tls support is required"
4) Then I swithced compiler with gcc-config (version 1.3) (to gcc 4.1.0)
PS: After 2) gcc -v reports gcc 4.1.0 but I think links to some libs are not changed correctly.

Yeah, your problem is you have BOTH gcc-config-1.3 and eselect-compiler installed.  That isn't supported, nor would I expect it to work

1) emerge -C gcc-config (1.3 removed)
2) emerge eselect eselect compiler
3) eselect compiler set <gcc 3.4> (switch to gcc 3.4 from gcc 4.1)
4) emerge --nodeps glibc :
                 from include/tls.h:6,
                 from sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/i386/sysdep.h:30,
                 from <stdin>:1:
nptl/sysdeps/i386/i686/../tls.h:65:3: #error "TLS support is required."

PS: eselect compiler has profile for already removed gcc 4.0.2 !

so, what is gcc --version there when it fails?  I assume this is 3.4 on amd64...

Yes it is gcc 3.4, but I think that links to some libs are not changed correctly. (link for tls include and lib files). gcc-config 1.3 changes compiler about 3 times slower - maybe it is doing some more things (switch not only gcc but the libs also)




Comment 9

          2006-04-01 08:44:17 UTC
        

gcc-config does it differently which is why it is slower, it is not taking longer because it is "doing more".

Please attach the output of:
i686-pc-linux-gnu-gcc --version

My guess is you haven't selected your compiler for i686-pc-linux-gnu.

And re: your PS, that's because /etc/eselect/compiler is protected by CONFIG_PROTECT.  Add the following to make.conf:

CONFIG_PROTECT_MASK="/etc/eselect/compiler"

Closing due to lack of response
