Run on all logging in /etc/conf.d/mythbackend and look at the results. It works
for me since that's how mine's run.

Fix whatever the error msg it is complaining about. Make sure your directdata
subscription hasn't expired. Make sure if you're using xmltv that the grabber
hasn't gone bad.

Thanks for the response Doug.  I've cranked up the logging as you recommended. 
When I run mythfilldatabase from the command line with the root user, it works
fine, so I suspect it is something to do with mythbackend.  Probably a config
issue on my part, but I didn't change a thing with that when I upgraded.  I'll
see what it does tonight.
