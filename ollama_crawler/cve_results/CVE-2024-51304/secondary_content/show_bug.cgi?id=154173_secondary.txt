I am sorry for posting this here but I didn't know where to post it.
I noticed that I am not the only person prefering a good, clean stage 1 installation. Many Gentoo users (all I know), prefer stage 1.

Please that it back. We really use it.

Uhm? The stages are still there...

http://gentoo.osuosl.org/releases/x86/2006.1/stages/
http://gentoo.osuosl.org/releases/amd64/2006.1/stages/

etc. etc. 

If you are asking whether we'll support stage1 installs again, then the answer is no.
