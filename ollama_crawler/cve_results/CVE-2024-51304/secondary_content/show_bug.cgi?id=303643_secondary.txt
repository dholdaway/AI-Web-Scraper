I run a laptop and a desktop computer. On my desktop sci-chemistry/mgltools-autodocktools-1.5.4-r1 launches without errors, but on the laptop it fails this way:

===
$ runAdt

    self.id = self.clipPlaneNames[num]

hit enter to continue

After pressing enter the program quits.

Same problem reported at ubuntu (without resolution):
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mgltools-dejavu/+bug/500453

Also there are two forum threads suggesting that this could be ati drivers issue:

http://n2.nabble.com/adt-does-not-work-IndexError-list-index-out-of-range-td4104094.html
http://mgl.scripps.edu/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=584

urcindalo, could you try and confirm anything that this is ati drivers version? Also I think it's good idea to report this issue upstream.

Yes, I use ati-drivers 9.11 on my laptop, whilst in my desktop computer I have an old nvidia card. Apart from that, the configurations of both computers are almost twins.

By upstream do you mean mgltools or ati? Anyway, I'm going to report the issue in the mgltools thread you kindly indicate.

Thanks very, very much for your help and for the time dedicated to look for the cause of this problem.

I tested it here and it is fine on intel hardware.
Except the fact, that the RDEPs in mgltools-autodocktools are missing many needed ones.

Update: I've changed my driver from "fglrx" to "radeon" and now mgltools launch
beautifully.

Thus, I can confirm ati-drivers is the culprit in my case.
