Issue: games-emulation/generator calls ar directly.
Discovered on: amd64

NOTE:
As per QA policy, toolchain tools must not be called directly because they can cause issue in cross-compiling and because is not possible use a different AR implementation (like llvm-ar). To reproduce, please use sys-devel/gcc-config[-native-symlinks], sys-devel/binutils-config[-native-symlinks] and set the AR variable to x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-ar.
