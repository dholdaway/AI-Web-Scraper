Description

When running ldconfig command (manually or by compiling a package), this warning appears :

ldconfig: /lib/libreadline.so.5 is not a symbolic link

It seems to be fixed in next glibc release (see https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=495830).



Reproducible: Always

This has nothing to do with glibc.  ldconfig is complaining about a file left on your system.

base-system:  is this some random leftover file or something?

Ok done Mark :-),

I didn't see the final dev's advice after compiling readline :

 * Old versions of installed libraries were detected on your system.
 * In order to avoid breaking packages that depend on these old libs,
 * the libraries are not being removed.  You need to run revdep-rebuild
 * in order to remove these old dependencies.  If you do not have this
 * helper program, simply emerge the 'gentoolkit' package.
 * 
 *   # revdep-rebuild --library libreadline.so.5
 * 
 * Once you've finished running revdep-rebuild, it should be safe to
 * delete the old libraries.  Here is a copy & paste for the lazy:
 *   # rm '/lib64/libhistory.so.4'
 *   # rm '/lib64/libhistory.so.5'
 *   # rm '/lib64/libreadline.so.4'
 *   # rm '/lib64/libreadline.so.5'

I have removed the old *so.5 libraries and the annoying compilation warning disappears.

Thanks.

i'm not aware of any such bug that would have caused this in the readline ebuild, but that doesnt mean there was a transient one a long time ago

if you follow the ebuild's advice, then everything would resolve itself anyways, so ...
