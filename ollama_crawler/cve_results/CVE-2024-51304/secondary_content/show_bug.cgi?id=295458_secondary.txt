app-emulation/vmware-workstation-6.5.3.185404 ebuild depends on sys-fs/fuse.
FUSE is included in the latest kernels.
besided sys-fs/fuse doesn't compile, complaining on the kernel version.

needs fixing dependancies

sys-fs/fuse is a bit more than just the kernel module, userspace utilities, library, ....
set the in-kernel fuse driver to build as module and fuse will install without complaints (tested on 2.6.32)

I don't think I need to fix dependencies, so i'll forward this issue to sys-fs/fuse maintainer to have a look.
Thanks.

Not really much info here. sys-fs/fuse works fine with 2.6.32. And indeed, this package provides afaik the userspace part, which is still needed in addition to kernel support. 

I'm resolving this as WORKSFORME. If fuse still doesn't compile, that's a bug for the sys-fs/fuse maintainers- please re-file a new one then. :)
