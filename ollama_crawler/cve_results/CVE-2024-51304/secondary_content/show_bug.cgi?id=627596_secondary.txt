On 2017-07-18 a mail inquiring project status was sent to project alias. I do not have any reply registered for this project.

If you have not received the mail, please contact me. If I missed your reply, then I'm sorry, please just let me know. Otherwise, please look into replying to that mail. The reply is important to determine the project status and the steps to follow.

Do you have any suggestions what we could do to improve that situation?  Maybe you could write to gentoo-project@ asking for new people to join.

Currently, we have 5 members and one leader in artwork project.
