The optional framebuffer section describes manythings, but not how to actuall use it.

Optional: Framebuffer

If you have configured your kernel with framebuffer support (or you used genkernel's default kernel configuration), you can activate it by adding a vga and/or a video statement to your bootloader configuration file.

64-bit systems must use the the vesafb driver, and so will need to set the vga statement. The vga statement controls the resolution and color depth of your framebuffer screen for vesafb. As stated in /usr/src/linux/Documentation/fb/vesafb.txt (which gets installed when you install a kernel source package), you need to pass the VESA number corresponding to the requested resolution and color depth to it.

The following table lists the available resolutions and colordepths and matches those against the value that you need to pass on to the vga statement.
	640x480 	800x600 	1024x768 	1280x1024
256 	0x301 	0x303 	0x305 	0x307
32k 	0x310 	0x313 	0x316 	0x319
64k 	0x311 	0x314 	0x317 	0x31A
16M 	0x312 	0x315 	0x318 	0x31B

The video statement controls framebuffer display options. It needs to be given the framebuffer driver (vesafb for 2.6 kernels, or vesa for 2.4 kernels) followed by the control statements you wish to enable. All variables are listed in /usr/src/linux/Documentation/fb/vesafb.txt, but we'll inform you about three most-used options:
Control 	Description
ywrap 	Assume that the graphical card can wrap around its memory (i.e. continue at the beginning when it has approached the end)
mtrr:n 	Setup MTRR registers. n can be: 0 - disabled 1 - uncachable 2 - write-back 3 - write-combining 4 - write-through

The result of those two statements could be something like vga=0x318 video=vesafb:mtrr:3,ywrap or video=vesafb:mtrr:3,ywrap,1024x768-32@85. Remember (or write down) this setting; you will need it shortly.


no mention in this chapter about where to use it.

A few lines further:

"If you need to pass any additional options to the kernel, simply add them to the end of the kernel command. We're already passing one option (root=/dev/hda3 or real_root=/dev/hda3), but you can pass others as well, such as the video statement for framebuffer as we discussed previously."
