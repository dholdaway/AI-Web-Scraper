By default fontconfig 2.3.2 uses Nimbus* for all this aliases. It leads to ugliness in non-latin characters if you use Helvetica font for example. Proposed patch changes aliases as they were in previous version (2.2.3).

For example in my configuration all russian characters look 2 sizes smaller than latin ones. Latin is 10 and russian looks like 8.

My locale is:
LANG=ru_RU.UTF-8
LC_CTYPE=ru_RU.UTF-8
LC_NUMERIC=ru_RU.UTF-8
LC_TIME=en_US
LC_COLLATE=ru_RU.UTF-8
LC_MONETARY=ru_RU.UTF-8
LC_MESSAGES=en_US
LC_PAPER=ru_RU.UTF-8
LC_NAME=ru_RU.UTF-8
LC_ADDRESS=ru_RU.UTF-8
LC_TELEPHONE=ru_RU.UTF-8
LC_MEASUREMENT=ru_RU.UTF-8
LC_IDENTIFICATION=ru_RU.UTF-8
LC_ALL=

in fontconfig-2.4.2's 60-latin.conf Times, Verdana, and Courier New are preferred before their Nimbus counterparts.
