Works with portage.

I know it works with portage. I reported it as not working with paludis which most likely means it is a runtime blockage as paludis checks runtime dependencies and portage does not.

The problem was resolved by rebuilding eselect a second time. I was then able to rebuild both paludis and portage which had dependencies on eselect-news. There is a bug somewhere because the second building of eselect news resulted in a news module where the first build of 1.2-rc1 did not.

Reopening for proper resolution.

Ditto on rebuilding eselect a second time. I removed eselect-news-20080320, installed eselect-1.2. Paludis failed to install, complaining about missing eselect-news. I reinstalled eselect, which this second time around installed the news module, and paludis subsequently installed with no problem.

This bug has minimal information because I'm being lazy today. If more info would prove useful, I'll be glad to provide.
