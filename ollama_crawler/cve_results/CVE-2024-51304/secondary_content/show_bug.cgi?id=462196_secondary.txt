Build log

When emerging sci-physics/meep-1.1.1, installed libraries such as zlib and gsl cannot be found even though they are installed. Configure fails when guile-config is reported as broken.

Note that e.g. media-sound/snd which also uses guile, works fine.

Attach config.log too.

config.log

Here's config.log.  Configure seems to fail exactly with the libraries for which the test program defines F77_DUMMY_MAIN.

Actually, according to the config.log, failures start once HARMINV_LIBS get added.

Within that var is '-latlas' and that lib isn't being found.

It's hard to tell whether it's just the var containing too many libs (overlinking) or if i.e. you have a version of atlas installed which isn't supported by the main tree.

Apparently, my harminv install used atlas, and this is where everything went horribly wrong.

So re-emerging harminv, and then emerging meep passes the configure stage and moves on to compile.
