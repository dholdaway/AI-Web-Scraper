Please provide the full build log. Are you sure the source file is accessible? I'm referring to this error:

OSError: [Errno 5] Input/output error

By the way, it works on my ~amd64 machine.

This does not look like a problem in net-libs/gnutls or in sys-apps/portage. Please check your system sanity (disk space, permissions, and so on) and file a new bug report when you find something that definitely is a bug. You can use our web forums, IRC channels and mailing lists to seek support for this issue; this bug tracker is not the right place to look for help.

Works for you, doesn't mean works for anyone. But okay!

Please provide more evidence, because we both couldn't reproduce this.
