 Exhibit 99.1UNDER ARMOUR REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR FISCAL 2024 RESULTS; PROVIDES INITIAL FISCAL 2025 OUTLOOKCompany Also Announced a New $500 Million Share Repurchase ProgramBALTIMORE, May 16, 2024 – Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE: UA, UAA) announced unaudited financial results for its fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2024, which ended March 31, 2024. The company reports its financial performance following accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). This press release refers to "currency neutral" and "adjusted" amounts, which are non-GAAP financial measures described below under the "Non-GAAP Financial Information" paragraph. “Amid a challenging retail environment in fiscal 2024 that included high inventories and a consistent drumbeat of promotions – we demonstrated disciplined expense control and delivered results that were aligned with our previous outlook,” said Under Armour President and CEO Kevin Plank. “We also maintained a strong balance sheet, closing the year with a solid cash position and healthy inventory levels.”Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Review•Revenue was down 5 percent to $1.3 billion (down 5 percent currency neutral).–North America revenue decreased 10 percent to $772 million, and international revenue increased 7 percent to $561 million (up 6 percent currency neutral). In the international business, revenue increased 10 percent in EMEA (up 7 percent currency neutral), 1 percent in Asia-Pacific (up 5 percent currency neutral), and 20 percent in Latin America (up 12 percent currency neutral). –Wholesale revenue decreased 7 percent to $850 million, and direct-to-consumer revenue was flat at $455 million. Owned and operated store revenue increased 7 percent and eCommerce revenue decreased 8 percent, representing 43 percent of the total direct-to-consumer business for the quarter.–Apparel revenue decreased 1 percent to $877 million. Footwear revenue was down 11 percent to $338 million. Accessories revenue was down 7 percent to $89 million.•Gross margin increased 170 basis points to 45.0 percent, driven primarily by supply chain benefits related to lower product and freight costs. This was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts and proactive inventory management actions, including increased promotional activities in our direct-to-consumer business.•Selling, general & administrative expenses were up 5 percent to $603 million. Excluding a $58 million litigation reserve expense, adjusted selling, general & administrative expenses were down 5 percent to $546 million.•Operating loss was $4 million. Adjusted operating income was $54 million.•Net Income was $7 million. Adjusted net income was $49 million.•Diluted earnings per share was $0.02. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.11.•Inventory was down 19 percent to $958 million. •At the end of the quarter, Cash and Cash Equivalents were $859 million, and no borrowings were outstanding under the company's $1.1 billion revolving credit facility.The following information was filed by Under Armour, Inc. (UAA) on Thursday, May 16, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.

 Inside Under Armour, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Although we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity over the long term, a prolonged or more severe economic recession, inflationary pressure, or a slow recovery could adversely affect our business and liquidity and could require us to take certain of the liquidity preserving actions described above.



 Financial - Expense   Highlight
This was primarily due to higher litigation reserve, net losses arising from foreign currency hedges, and higher incentive compensation expenses, partially offset by lower consulting expenses.

 Other - Other   Highlight
In determining the amount of the reserve, we consider historical levels of credit losses and significant economic developments within the retail environment that could impact the ability of our customers to pay outstanding balances and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations.

 Financial - Debt   Highlight
Our obligations under the amended credit agreement are guaranteed by certain domestic significant subsidiaries of Under Armour, Inc., subject to customary exceptions (the "subsidiary guarantors") and primarily secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of Under Armour, Inc. and the subsidiary guarantors, excluding real property, capital stock in and debt of subsidiaries of Under Armour, Inc. holding certain real property and other customary exceptions.

 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
We make ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
