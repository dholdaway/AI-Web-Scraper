Description

It can happen under various circumstances:
- a bug in libxklavier library
- a bug in X server (xkbcomp, xmodmap utilities)
- X server with incompatible libxkbfile implementation

X server version data:
The X.Org Foundation
10503000

If you report this situation as a bug, please include:
- The result of xprop -root | grep XKB
- The result of gconftool-2 -R /desktop/gnome/peripherals/keyboard/kbd

$ xprop -root | grep XKB
_XKB_RULES_NAMES_BACKUP(STRING) = "evdev", "evdev", "us", "", ""
_XKB_RULES_NAMES(STRING) = "evdev", "evdev", "us", "", ""

$ gconftool-2 -R /desktop/gnome/peripherals/keyboard/kbd
 layouts = [dvorak,us]
 model = microsoft
 overrideSettings = false
 options = [grp	grp:alts_toggle]

Looked up older bugs that were similar, but none of the solutions worked.  This happens every so often, and I usually manage to get it sorted, but this time I'm stumped.

Reproducible: Always

Turns out some stale gconf configuration was causing problems.  I removed the
~/.gconf/desktop/gnome/peripherals/keyboard/ directory and things started working
again.  Probably the switch to evdev.
