Description

When the slotting for PHP was done, some PECL extensions did not get slotted for 5.2 that work perfectly well with 5.2 and worked fine with it before slotting.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Mask PHP 5.3 out
2. Attempt to emerge dev-php5/xcache

Actual Results:  
Will not emerge. Complains that it needs PHP 5.3.

Expected Results:  
Emerges dev-php5/xcache for PHP 5.2 slot.

Had the same problem with pecl/memcache and it was fixed.

Works for me:

# PHP_TARGETS=php5-2 emerge -pv xcache
[ebuild  N    ] virtual/httpd-php-5.3  0 kB
[ebuild  N    ] dev-php5/xcache-1.3.0-r2  PHP_TARGETS="php5-2 -php5-3" 0 kB

Hmm, yeah, if I put PHP_TARGETS in make.conf it works. But, should that be required if I have only PHP 5.2 installed and selected?

That would be tricky. Extensions would have to be dependant on the particular PHP version installed and such. It is better to just set the PHP_TARGETS variable, emerge an extension and let PHP be pulled in as a dependency.
