the binary version of firefox says a long time now on e.g. http://leader.ru/secure/who.html

Firefox v 10.0
Windows NT v 6.1

e.g. breaks installation on linux exlusive Firefox-Add-on's, also other servers are thinking "run's on windows"

Is this ID forced for some reason?

Should show version e.g. 33.0 and Linux OS!

addition:
only happens with migrating existing firefox-profile (or after adding some firefox addons, configuring it? to complex to find out)

maybe (not sure) used profile from www-client/firefox.

Thought had used several times in the past a new firefox profile to clean up, but reappears from time to time

would be very complex to test...


Short: make backups from passwords/bookmarks, deleting .mozilla and .cache/mozilla, restart firefox-bin/new profile works - but should also work for migrating (very) old profiles

Please reopen this bug report once you have figured out how the www-client/firefox-bin ebuild is causing this.
