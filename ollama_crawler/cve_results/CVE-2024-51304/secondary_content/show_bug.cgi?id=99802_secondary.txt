Description

Graphviz-2.4 is now the stable release from: http://www.graphviz.org/

graphviz-2.4 provides a new plugin framework for renderers, and eventually other
components, which can be independently packaged and compiled.

graphviz-cairo-2.4 is a separate source package that provides a renderer plugin
using cairo for antialised graphics.

graphviz-2.4 provides new swig-generated language bindings for: perl, python,
ruby, tcl, php, guile, java, ...

Provides a changed C binding (uses libgvh, gvc.h, and pkgconfig instead of
libdotneato, dotneato.h, and dotneato-config-sh).

The core layout engines are basically unchanged in function since
graphviz-2.2.1, except for bug fixes: 156, 255, 492, 631, 641, 647, 659, 662,
665, 670, 690, 691, 701, 702, 703, 705, 730, 731, 732, 741, 743
(For details, see: http://www.graphviz.org/bugs/buglist.html )

The program "lefty" has been upgraded, providing improvements
to "dotty" and "lneato" 



Reproducible: Always

Bumped in portage. I'll prepare cario ebuild when it'll be unmasked.

graphviz-cairo-2.4.ebuild

Suggest media-gfx/graphviz-cairo.

This will have to stay masked until cairo-0.9.x is out of mask.

See bug 101337 for discussion of updating /usr/lib/graphviz/config when new
graphviz plugins are installed.

graphviz-2.6 and graphviz-cairo-2.6 are now available:
    http://www.graphviz.org/pub/graphviz/ARCHIVE/graphviz-2.6.tar.gz
    http://www.graphviz.org/pub/graphviz/ARCHIVE/graphviz-cairo-2.6.tar.gz

graphviz-2.6 fixes bugs: 746, 750, 752, 753, 754, 756, 761, 763, 764, 765, 768,
                771, 772, 773, 774, 775, 776, 777, 778
(For details, see: http://www.graphviz.org/bugs/buglist.html )

graphviz-cairo-2.6 provides:
   - antialised bitmap rendering for PNG, GIF, JPG output formats
   - a new desktop application "DotEdit"
      (still buggy and not feature complete but possibly usable now as a graph
viewer.  I expect to release a more complete and useful version next month. )

Please make stable, graphviz 1.x did some bad rendering which is fixed in 2.x, 
which runs stable here (x86).

Has been merged into main graphiz package. Please close.

Indeed, pointless bug; just emerge graphviz w/ USE=cairo.
