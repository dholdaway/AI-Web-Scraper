Not a gnupg bug, repoman needs to be fixed. This doesn't belong into IUSE.

It's not just repoman. Emerge current says:

...
>>> md5 files   ;-) files/gnupg-1.4.2-jari.patch
>>> md5 src_uri ;-) gnupg-1.4.2.2.tar.bz2
QA Notice: USE Flag 'kernel_linux' not in IUSE for app-crypt/gnupg-1.4.2.2

KERNEL is in USE_EXPAND_HIDDEN, you may now add it to IUSE.

It does belong in IUSE.  IUSE is supposed to track *every* USE conditional within every ebuild.  However, this doesn't mean that the user has to see the these USE flags in the emerge output. That's why we have USE_EXPAND_HIDDEN which is available in >=portage-2.1_rc2-r1.  It has USE_EXPAND_HIDDEN="ELIBC KERNEL USERLAND" in make.globals so that users will not see kernel_linux in the emerge output.

This will be obsolete once bug #113474 is completed. as the need for IUSE=linux_kernel is going away.

in one month, when 1.4.5-r1 goes stable, this bug can be closed.

1.4.5-r2 and/or 1.4.6 stable everywhere, closing this bug.
