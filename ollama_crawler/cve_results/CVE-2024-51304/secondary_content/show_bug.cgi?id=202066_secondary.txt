Description

When this package is built without Gtk/Tk support thus not creating the pidgin executable (only results in finch, still creates a menu item in kde.  This menu item points the the pidgin executable which does not exist,  this could create confusion.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.disable gtk, tk use flags
2.emerge pidgin
3.check menu in your desktop environment, select internet -> pidgin


Actual Results:  
it doesn't execute pidgin as the binary doesn't exist,  however no error results leading to confusion. 

Expected Results:  
the menu item shouldn't exist in this case.
