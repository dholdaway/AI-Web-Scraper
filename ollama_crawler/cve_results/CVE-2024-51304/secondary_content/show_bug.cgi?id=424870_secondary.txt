It would be nice if portage would show a notification when an upgrade (emerge -DNavu world) also upgrades an sys-*/ package.

Reproducible: Always

for clearification, it would be nice if it would be something like the attention message when an upgrade of portage is aviable.

Rather than base it on the category, maybe it would be better to us the "system set" that's defined in the profile. For example, see $PORTDIR/profiles/base/packages. Actually, system packages can already have special color coding in the merge list, if you configure PKG_MERGE_SYSTEM in /etc/portage/color.map. See `man color.map'.

You're right, @system would be enough as this guarantees at least a working base system. So even if the other stuff is broken, with a working @system you can at least fix it (except the kernel :P)

but would be awesome if this color map for System packages would be default or when emerge gives the output of what packages get merged and system packages are there, they get grouped together like

emerge -DNavu world

These are the packages that would be merged, in order:

The reason for the current default is that it's pretty safe to assume that @selected packages are the most interesting to users.

Your interest in @system seems to based on the idea that these are the packages that are most likely to break your system in a way that's difficult to recover from? If so, it seems like a rather paranoid attitude to have. :)

I guess we could add an option for that. I wouldn't enable it by default, because some people like to know the exact merge order in advance (see bug 158100 for example).

So the udev upgrade was paranoia? When using (~) i think its more than just paranoia =)
For people which are willing to test packages before they are out, i think it should be easy as possible. Maybe an additional warning at the beginning + the correct order would be a compromis?
