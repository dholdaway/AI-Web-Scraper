Please mark =sys-kernel/suspend2-sources-2.6.19-r2 stable on amd64 and
x86. This kernel works correctly.

Please, don't cc the arches directly, only the maintainer can do that.

Eh; IMO we shouldn't stabilize unsupported kernels at all.

 So should x86 drop the stable keyword?

Please don't.
I am maintaining stable marked version for suspend2 users know what works.

It is just that the suspend2-sources-2.6.19-r2 hangs from time to time, and I didn't wish other users to have issues with it.

I am waiting for Nigel to release the next version of suspend2 which is much more stable from what I see in 2.6.20.
