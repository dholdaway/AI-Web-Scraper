Hello there!

You're getting this bug because the package in Summary failed to build in my tinderbox using the gold link editor from binutils. Before closing the bug as INVALID let me explain why this is still important!

The gold link editor does not support underlinking of shared objects, which is something I have described in my blog post:

http://blog.flameeyes.eu/2010/11/26/it-s-not-all-gold-that-shines-why-underlinking-is-a-bad-thing

Even the basic link editor (ld.bfd) has an option to support this but it is a heck to enable and get passed, so linking with gold is simply quicker.

Fixing underlinking provides optimized --as-needed builds (because the "softer" version no longer need to recover libraries that are underlinked), so it is a Good Thing To Do.

Thank you very much for the attention!

I can't reproduce this. It seems all the configure checks for -ldl are in place but then it doesn't end up adding that to LIBS.
