You should add $(python_get_sitedir)/${PN} as python_mod_cleanup command parameters.

The following is the full elog message:

 * Deprecation Warning: Not passing of paths to python_mod_cleanup() is deprecated and will be
 * disallowed on 2010-09-01. Call python_mod_cleanup() with paths to Python modules.
 * The ebuild needs to be fixed. Please report a bug, if it has not been already reported.

This problem has been fixed 11 days ago.
The warning came from pkg_postrm() from environment saved in VDB.
