/usr/bin/js78 installed by spidermonkey has pie enabled on its own:

checksec --file=/usr/bin/js78
RELRO           STACK CANARY      NX            PIE             RPATH      RUNPATH      Symbols         FORTIFY Fortified       Fortifiable     FILE
Partial_RELRO   No canary found   NX enabled    PIE_enabled     No RPATH   No RUNPATH   No Symbols        Yes   10              26              /usr/bin/js78


checksec utility comes from app-admin/checksec

I don't think we are going to expose "--enable-pie". EXTRA_CONF is your friend.

Hmm indeed there's --enable-pie configure option that's most likely enabled by default. Althoguh I don't know what printing it to the ebuild does, but we can do that if that's what you want? Anwyay please check with current versions and reopen the bug if it's still valid.
