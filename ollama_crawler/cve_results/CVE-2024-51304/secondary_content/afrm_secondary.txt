2 Shareholder  Letter Fourth Fiscal Quarter 2024 

 




Fellow Affirm shareholders: We delivered excellent results in both the fourth fiscal quarter as well as full 2024 fiscal year.  Just over two years ago, we set a public goal of achieving profitability on an adjusted  operating income basis exiting FY’23. As our FY’23 ended, we were proud to report that we  achieved this goal. Adjusted operating income in FQ4’23 was just $15 million, but it had a plus  sign in front of it!  One year later – now – our adjusted operating income is $381 million for the full FY’24,  $150 million of it earned in the fourth fiscal quarter – thanks to continued product  improvements, merchant growth, attentive risk management, and excellent capital execution.  It is therefore only appropriate that we set another public goal today: we intend and expect  to be profitable on a GAAP basis in our fourth fiscal quarter, and plan to operate the  business while maintaining GAAP profitability thereafter. Growth is always the answer At its core, Affirm is a very simple business. We connect buyers to sellers, in a network for  payments, where each transaction is an individually-priced, honest deal for the buyer and a  genuinely incremental sale for the seller. So long as our transactional unit economics stay  positive (and preferably in our target range of 3-4% revenue less transaction costs as a  percentage of GMV), the path to reaching any profitability goal is simply more transactions.  Fortunately, we see no shortage of demand for the honest financial products Affirm builds and  the transactions these products enable.  We grew GMV at a rate exceeding 30% and revenue at a rate exceeding 45% – in both the  quarter and the fiscal year. Transactions on the Affirm network grew 42% year over year to  24.7 million in FQ4’24, and 15% sequentially vs. FQ3’24. Transactions per active consumer  continued to increase, reaching 4.9 in FQ4’24. Consumers transacting quarterly or more often  accounted for approximately 40% of all Affirm transactions in FY’24 (vs approximately 10% in  FY’21).  Turning to merchants, year-over-year growth in active merchant count accelerated for the third  quarter in a row, exceeding 300,000 as of the end of FY’24, as we continued to make it easier  to onboard Affirm and launched new products that resonated with both consumers and  merchants. Today, we partner with the top three brands and commerce platforms in the U.S.  by market share. By the end of this calendar year, we expect that Affirm will be natively  integrated into four of the top digital wallets in North America.  Yet, with GMV barely over 2% of U.S. and Canadian e-commerce, we’ve only just scratched  the surface of our opportunity. We are committed to continuing to demonstrate operating  leverage (it’s addictive once you get it right), but the governing constraint we feel today is the  challenge of selecting which, of the many, growth opportunities to pursue now versus later.  Our growth efforts are broadly divided into increasing consumer engagement and expanding  network reach.

FQ4’24 Highlights 

 




Trailing Twelve Month Transactions and GMV Per Repeat Consumer defined as transactions or GMV from repeat  consumers within the trailing twelve month period at measurement divided by the number of repeat consumers.  Increasing consumer engagement Building on our roots in considered purchases, we have increased frequency of use and total spend with Affirm by offering  merchant-subsidized 0% and low APR deals and expanding the network to support smaller-sized, more frequent transactions. Our  consumer-first approach, unique features of the Affirm app, and the near-ubiquitous acceptance of the Affirm Card add reasons for  consumers to use our services wherever and whenever they need us. We have plenty more to do, but the results so far speak for  themselves. TBD… 3Affirm FQ4’24 Shareholder Letter Consumer Engagement By Acquisition Cohort The success of our continued efforts is even more apparent in cohortized repeat consumer transactions and GMV, shown on a  trailing 12-month basis. Recent cohorts showcase the steady improvement in how quickly each cohort of repeat consumers  ramps up their usage of Affirm in terms of both transaction frequency and total spend.  Accelerating the first repeat and improving subsequent frequency remain our top goals. In FY’25, we expect to refine the Affirm Card  experience further and integrate it better with the Affirm Money Account, expand our universal prequalification program, which helps  consumers better budget their purchases, and continue to invest in our app user experience. Our personalized transactional  incentives platform is live in our app and website with encouraging results, and we expect it to drive further engagement as we roll it  out widely.  Old language: We consider a consumer “repeat” once they transact with  Affirm for the second time. In cohorts of recently acquired  consumers, approximately 60% repeat within the first year,  and the time to reach the second transaction is trending  steadily shorter. This second transaction is something of a magic unlock:  cohort retention of consumers that repeat within first twelve  months is over 90%. Repeat Consumers by Acquisition Cohort Trailing Twelve Month Transactions Per Repeat Consumer Trailing Twelve Month GMV Per Repeat Consumer Repeat Consumer defined as a consumer that has transacted with Affirm at least twice. Chart calculated as Repeat  Consumers within an acquisition cohort as of the measurement date divided by total consumers within the acquisition  cohort. Repeat consumer defined as a consumer that has transacted with Affirm at least twice.  Chart calculated as repeat consumers within an acquisition cohort as of the  measurement date divided by total consumers within the acquisition cohort. Trailing Twelve Month Transactions and GMV Per Repeat Consumer defined as transactions and GMV, respectively, from repeat consumers within the trailing twelve month period divided by the  number of total repeat consumers as of FQ4’24. For the purposes of the calculations used in creating these graphs, repeat consumers remained constant for each quarterly cohort presented. % of Consumers with Two or More Lifetime TransactionsWe consider a consumer “repeat” once they transact with  Affirm for the second time. In cohorts of recently acquired  consumers, approximately 60% repeat within the first year,  and the time to reach the second transaction is trending  steadily shorter. This second transaction is something of a magic unlock: on  average, 90% of repeat consumers transacting on any  given day will transact again in the next 12 months. 

 




4Affirm FQ4’24 Shareholder Letter Expanding network reach Ending FY’24, our network had over 300,000 integrated active  merchants. While our consumers can transact at nearly all  merchants in the U.S. and Canada with the Affirm Card, direct  integrations help us deliver a truly differentiated user  experience with Adaptive Checkout, underwrite each  transaction more precisely, and maximize merchant sales with  Affirm.  The sheer scale of our consumer base – we’ve underwritten  about 50 million Americans – has become a significant  reason for merchants to add Affirm to their checkout pages.  This drives more consumers to sign up (or repeat!) with Affirm,  which, in turn, motivates more merchants to join us.  In FY’25 we are also focused on increasing reach and share of  cart via our merchant platform and digital wallet partnerships.  Digital wallets are estimated to have processed more than  $700 billion in North America in calendar year ’23, of which  less than 1% was captured by Affirm, and we believe this  represents a significant expansion opportunity for us.  One of our goals is to help merchants profitably grow sales.  Recently announced Pay-in-2 and Pay-in-30-days (“Pay-in-X”)  are just some of our efforts to help address a wider variety of  transactions while helping merchants lower the cost of  payment acceptance, with more to come in FY’25. Dollar-Based Net Expansion (DBNE) is based on the quarterly GMV of merchants during  the measurement period for merchants that were active during the same quarter in the  prior fiscal year, divided by the GMV for this group of merchants during the same  quarter in the prior fiscal year. This calculation excludes GMV from outside the U.S., as  well as GMV from Returnly, and direct-to-consumer products such as Affirm Card and  one-time virtual cards. GMV is shown by the fiscal year in which it was realized. Merchant cohorts are based on the fiscal year in which a merchant was acquired by Affirm, with the acquisition date defined as the  date that Affirm first captured a loan with a merchant. This chart excludes GMV from outside the U.S., as well as Returnly and direct to consumer products such as Affirm Card and one-time  virtual cards. Expansion multiple defined as GMV realized during FY'24 for a given merchant cohort divided by the first 365 days of GMV after a merchant launched within the same merchant  cohort.  Consistent Dollar-Based Net Expansion  Another network growth vector is the expansion beyond North  America. As we complete the necessary product and  engineering work, we’ve been active in the market for the last  few quarters, and expect to officially launch in the UK before  this calendar year wraps up.  While we are far from first to launch a pay-later product in  Europe, we are encouraged by the merchant response to the  Affirm way of treating consumers (no late fees, no deferred  interest, no gotchas, no funny stuff!) and the unique products  we bring to the market (flexible terms with customizable  payment options). GMV by Merchant Acquisition Cohort 

 




5Affirm FQ4’24 Shareholder Letter Growing profitably The best insurance policy a payments and (especially) credit  company can have against whatever macro headwinds come  at us next is a strong, resilient margin structure. The last  couple years of elevated Fed funds rate have given us  a chance to demonstrate that Affirm’s most important  advantage is our ability to find ways to win in very different  macroeconomic conditions. Indeed, the $381 million of  adjusted operating income we earned in FY’24 represents  an adjusted operating margin increase from (5%) in FY’23 to  16% in FY’24.  While credit didn’t get a lot of airplay in this letter, we are  keeping a watchful eye on performance, which remains in line  with our expectations. We are also pleased to report that the  U.S. consumer continues to shop and to buy, and is more  open-minded than ever to the idea of honest financial products  that put them in control of their financial destiny.  We made great progress in FY’24. The opportunities ahead of  us are significant, and we are excited to take full advantage of  them. Scaling the Affirm Card, amplifying engagement with  personalized incentives, rolling out new integrations, going live  in the UK, and doing it all while achieving GAAP profitability is  our plan for FY’25, and we are off to a fine start.  All of this can only be accomplished by a team of truly  ambitious, insanely hard-working, deeply mission-driven  people that is Affirm. Thank you Affirmers, and congratulations  on another fantastic year.

FQ4’24 Operating Highlights 6Affirm FQ4’24 Shareholder Letter Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) grew 31% year over year  to $7.2 billion and significantly outpaced overall e-commerce  growth. GMV from our top five merchants and platform  partners collectively grew 38% year over year, with continued  gains in share of cart.    GMV growth was diversified across categories and products,  and all categories except sporting goods and outdoor grew  year over year. The general merchandise category grew 45%  year over year and was both the largest category and most  substantial contributor to our overall growth rate. The travel  and ticketing, electronics, and equipment and auto categories  all grew more than 20% year over year.  Direct-to-Consumer GMV (D2C GMV) grew 37% year over  year to $1.9 billion. Within D2C, Affirm Card generated $507 million in GMV,  up from $374 million during FQ3’24 and $129 million during  FQ4’23. Active cardholder count grew approximately  30% quarter over quarter in FQ4’24, and we approached  1.2 million active cardholders at quarter end. Ongoing  product improvements enabled us to expand card eligibility  to more of our customer base and supported growth in  active cardholders and GMV. Consistent with prior periods,  card unit economics remained similar to that of Affirm overall.  Although interest-bearing loans accounted for more than 80%  of Card GMV at fiscal year end, the collective mix of Pay Now,  Pay-in-X, and monthly 0% APR products increased  consistently over the course of the fiscal year. The mix of card  GMV may shift towards merchant-funded products such as  Pay-in-X and monthly 0% as we harmonize merchant offers  across surfaces.  Active consumers excluding the discontinued Returnly  business increased 19% year over year to 18.6 million as of  June 30, 2024. Active merchant count increased 19% year  over year to 303,000 as of June 30, 2024, marking our third  consecutive quarter of acceleration in year-over-year  growth of active merchant count as merchant acceptance  of Affirm continues to increase.  

 




FQ4’24 Financial Highlights 7Affirm FQ4’24 Shareholder Letter Revenue Total revenue grew 48% year over year to $659 million.  Revenue as a percentage of GMV increased to 9.1%,  compared to 8.1% in FQ4’23. The following factors contributed  to revenue growth: ● Network revenue grew 28% year over year, in line with  overall GMV growth.  ● Interest income grew 57% year over year, driven by our  pricing initiatives and growth in loans held for investment. ● Gain on sales of loans grew 116% as we sold more loans  than in prior periods, with gain on sale benefitting in part  from the 2024-X1 transaction. The increase in loans sold  was driven by a combination of better funding market  conditions, higher average revenue per dollar of GMV due  to our pricing initiatives, and consistent execution by our  Capital team.  ● Servicing income was a small contributor to overall  growth, again driven by an increase in loans sold, which  led to a year-over-year increase in average off-balance  sheet platform portfolio.  Total Revenue As a percentage of GMV 9.1% +100 bps RLTC As a percentage of GMV 4.3% +100 bps Adj.

8Affirm FQ4’24 Shareholder Letter RLTC RLTC grew 70% year over year to $309 million, increasing 100  basis points to 4.3% of GMV compared to 3.3% of GMV in  FQ4’23. RLTC as a percentage of GMV exceeded our  long-term target of 3 to 4% due to the 2024-X1 securitization  transaction, which was approximately a $30 million benefit to  RLTC during the quarter. Excluding this transaction, RLTC as a  percentage of GMV would still have been at the high end of  our target range as we benefited from a stabilization in funding  market conditions.  Revenue as a percentage of GMV improved by 100 basis  points, driven by an 80 basis point increase in interest income  as a percentage of GMV. This increase reflected higher  balances of interest-bearing loans held for investment and the  pricing initiatives implemented in FY’23 and ’24. Gain on sales  of loans as a percentage of GMV also increased by  approximately 40 basis points as we sold more loans than in  the same period during the prior fiscal year. Modestly offsetting  these increases were declines in network revenue and  servicing income as a percentage of GMV. *Other transaction costs include processing and servicing expense  and loss on loan purchase commitment Year-over-Year Change in  RLTC as a % of GMV Year-over-Year Change in  Revenue as a % of GMV *Other revenue includes gain on sales of loans and servicing income 

 




9Affirm FQ4’24 Shareholder Letter Operating Income (Loss) Operating Income improved $170 million to a ($73) million  operating loss, compared to a ($244) million loss in FQ4’23.  Operating Income as a percentage of revenue, or Operating  Margin, was (11%) in the period, compared to (55%) during  FQ4’23. Of the $73 million loss, $114 million was attributable  to enterprise warrant and share-based expenses associated  with warrants granted to two enterprise partners, and $65  million to employee stock-based compensation expense. The $170 million improvement in Operating Income was driven  by a $43 million year-over-year reduction in other operating  expenses excluding transaction costs and a $127 million  increase in RLTC.  Operating expenses declined in part due to the restructuring  program announced in February 2023 and the realization of  several operational efficiency efforts. The largest decline was  in technology and data analytics expenses, which declined  $28 million year over year as we reduced infrastructure  expenses in absolute terms while growing GMV. Additionally,  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses  collectively declined by $14 million year over year, with sales  and marketing accounting for the majority of the decrease.  Adjusted Operating Income Adjusted Operating Income increased $135 million year over  year to $150 million, compared to $15 million Adjusted  Operating Income in FQ4’23. Adjusted Operating Income as a  percentage of Revenue, or Adjusted Operating Margin, was  23% during the period compared to 3% during FQ4’23.  Adjusted Operating Income excludes the impact of enterprise  warrant and share-based expenses, stock-based  compensation expense, and other items. Approximately 90% of the year-over-year increase in  adjusted operating income was due to the increase in RLTC.  Non-GAAP other operating expenses also declined $9 million,  or 5%, driven primarily by a decline in non-GAAP technology  and data analytics expenses.  Average Cost of Funds Slightly offsetting the increase in revenue as a percentage of  GMV was an increase in average cost of funds, which  contributed to approximately 20 basis points higher  transaction costs as a percentage of GMV. These higher  transaction costs were attributable to a higher benchmark  interest rate environment as well as the growth in loans held  for investment.  Average funding costs increased approximately 70 basis  points year over year, but have been stable at approximately  7.7% over the past three quarters. We believe our funding  debt has now fully absorbed the increase in benchmark  interest rates, which gives us further confidence in our 3 to  4% long-term RLTC as a percentage of GMV target range. Cost of funds defined as annualized funding costs divided by the average of funding debt  and notes issued by securitization trusts during the period 

 




10Affirm FQ4’24 Shareholder Letter Credit Quality 30+ day delinquencies excluding Pay in 4 and Peloton loans increased slightly both year over year and compared to FQ3’24. In line  with normal seasonal behavior, we expect delinquencies to increase over the coming months and decline thereafter due to loans  originated during the holiday shopping season.  Year-over-Year Comparison: Monthly  Installment Loan Ex-Peloton 30+ Day  Delinquency Rate Net Income (Loss) Net income improved $161 million year over year to a ($45) million loss, compared to a loss of ($206) million in FQ4’23. The  year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by a $127 million increase in RLTC and a $43 million decrease in Other  Operating Expenses. Of the $43 million decrease in Other Operating Expenses, $37 million was attributable to a decline in  stock-based compensation expense. Lesser factors were a slight year-over-year decrease in Other Income and increase in Income Tax Expense; these factors  collectively were a $5 million headwind to Net Income on a year-over-year basis.

We continue to see strong performance from our recent vintages of Pay in 4 loans, with ultimate loss rates for vintages originated in  fiscal year 2024 tracking towards less than 1% of GMV.  Cumulative Net Charge-offs by  Origination Vintage: Pay in 4 Loans Net charge-off performance Recent monthly installment loan cohorts are continuing to perform in-line with, or better than, historical cohorts that originated prior  to the COVID pandemic on the basis of cumulative charge-offs as a percentage of GMV. Cohorts originated during FY’24 are also  performing consistent with the cohorts originated during the same period in FY’23. 

 




12Affirm FQ4’24 Shareholder Letter Capital and Funding Update Funding Capacity increased to $16.1 billion at the end of  FQ4’24, up from $15.6 billion at the end of FQ3’24. This  marked the sixth consecutive quarter that funding capacity  increased as we continued to have healthy discussions  with both existing and prospective investors across funding  channels. This increase includes the expansion of our existing  forward flow relationship with CPPIB Credit Investments Inc.  (“CPP Investments”), which has committed $1.4 billion of  capital in a multi-year agreement.  We continued to execute in the ABS market, issuing  $750 million in our 2024-A revolving ABS transaction in  June, in addition to the $635 million 2024-X1 transaction  in April. Consistent with our other recent transactions, both  issuances were upsized and significantly oversubscribed.  Since FQ3’23, each of our ABS transactions have priced well  as evidenced by lower pricing spreads. In FY’24, we had total ABS issuances of $3.4 billion across  six unique offerings. This issuance volume surpassed the  previous high water mark achieved in FY’22 by 70%. We also  continued to diversify our ABS investor base and now have  more than 120 unique institutional partners investing in our  offerings. We attribute this improved performance to a  combination of execution on our strategic initiatives and a  favorable market backdrop.  As part of our commitment to build a programmatic ABS  platform, we expect that we will soon benefit from an additional  major ratings agency on our revolving ABS transactions. We  believe that this is an important milestone as it may open up  new pockets of capital and deepen interest across existing and  new investors. We also anticipate that this increased demand  will lead to an improvement in our cost of capital over time. Capital Allocation and Liquidity At the end of June, we had $2.1 billion in total liquidity split  between cash and securities available for sale, similar to our  total liquidity at both the end of March as well as the end of the  prior fiscal year. Against this amount, we had $1.3 billion in  convertible debt.  As previously announced, in December 2023 the Affirm board  of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $800 million in  aggregate principal amount of our outstanding convertible debt  during calendar year 2024. As of June 30, 2024,  we repurchased $77 million in face value of our convertible  debt for approximately $64 million in cash, resulting in a  gain on repurchase of approximately $13 million under this  authorization.  Subsequent to quarter end through August 23, 2024, we  repurchased an additional $141 million in face value of  our convertible debt for approximately $120 million in cash,  resulting in a gain on repurchase of approximately $20 million. Following these repurchases, as of August 23, 2024,  approximately $1.2 billion of the convertible debt remains  outstanding and the December repurchase authorization has  $582 million in remaining capacity. Subject to market  conditions, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to  optimize the debt capital structure and proactively manage  long-term liabilities. We may consider various approaches to  execute any future convertible note repurchases. This could  include open market purchases, privately negotiated  purchases, purchase plans under Rule 10b5-1, or through a  combination thereof. 

 




Financial Outlook 13Affirm FQ4’24 Shareholder Letter Assumptions Embedded within the Outlook Product and Go-to-Market Initiatives ● Our outlook includes the expected financial impact of our  Affirm Money Account, the business-to-business (B2B)  product, and our UK expansion. None of these initiatives  are expected to be material growth contributors during  FY’25. ● A recently-announced wallet partnership is not expected  to contribute materially to financial results in FY’25. This  reflects the early stage of the partnership which is  currently pre-commercialization. Seasonality  ● The quarterly seasonality of FY’25 GMV is expected to be  consistent with FY’24, with the second and fourth fiscal  quarters showing elevated volumes. Fiscal Q1 2025 Fiscal 2025 GMV $7.1 to $7.4 billion More than $33.5 billion Revenue $640 to $670 million At least 10 basis points higher than FY’24  as a % of GMV Transaction Costs $375 to $390 million Similar to FY’24 as a % of GMV Revenue Less Transaction Costs $265 to $280 million At least 10 basis points higher than FY’24  as a % of GMV Adjusted Operating Margin2 14 to 16 percent More than 18.4 percent Weighted Average Shares Outstanding 319 million 323 million Operating Income Based upon our current forecast, we  expect to achieve operating income  profitability on a GAAP basis in FQ4’25  and plan to operate the business going  forward in a manner designed to maintain  profitability on this basis. 2A reconciliation of adjusted operating margin to the comparable GAAP measure is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty regarding, and the potential  variability of, expenses that may be incurred in the future.  Enterprise warrant expense ● Expenses associated with amortization of the A through C  tranches of warrants granted to an enterprise partner are  expected to decline to $5 million per quarter in FQ3’25 and  FQ4’25 compared to $74 million in FQ3’24 and $72 million  in FQ4’24.  ● FY’25 expenses associated with the “performance tranche”  of warrants granted to the aforementioned enterprise  partner are expected to be similar to FY’24. Funding ● Equity Capital Required (“ECR”) as a percentage of Total  Platform Portfolio (“ECR Ratio”) is expected to remain  stable compared to FY’24. ● Based upon the current forward interest rate curve which is  embedded in our outlook, benchmark interest rates are  expected to decline in FY’25 which should be a tailwind to  RLTC as a percentage of GMV.

Key Operating Metrics Gross Merchandise Volume (“GMV”) - The Company defines GMV as the total dollar amount of all transactions on the  Affirm platform during the applicable period, net of refunds. GMV does not represent revenue earned by the Company.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Transaction Costs - The Company defines transaction costs as the sum of loss on loan purchase commitment, provision  for credit losses, funding costs, and processing and servicing expense.

Transaction Costs as a Percentage of GMV - The Company defines transaction costs as a Percentage of GMV as  transaction costs, as defined above, as a percentage of GMV, as defined above.

Revenue Less Transaction Costs (“RLTC”) - The Company defines revenue less transaction costs as GAAP total revenue  less transaction costs, as defined above. The Company believes that revenue less transaction costs is a useful financial  measure to both the Company and investors of the economic value generated by transactions processed on the  Company's platform.

Similar to adjusted operating income (loss), the Company  believes that adjusted operating margin is a useful financial measure to both the Company and investors for evaluating its  operating performance and that it facilitates period to period comparisons of the Company's results of operations as the  items excluded generally are not a function of the Company's operating performance. Total Platform Portfolio - The Company defines total platform portfolio as the unpaid principal balance outstanding of all  loans facilitated through its platform as of the balance sheet date, including loans held for investment, loans held for sale,  and loans owned by third-parties. The Company believes that total platform portfolio is a useful financial measure to both  the Company and investors in assessing the scale of funding requirements for the Company's network.  Equity Capital Required (“ECR”) - The Company defines equity capital required as the sum of the balance of loans held  for investment and loans held for sale, less the balance of funding debt and notes issued by securitization trusts as of the  balance sheet date. The Company believes that equity capital required is a useful financial measure to both the Company  and investors in assessing the amount of the Company's total platform portfolio that the Company funds with its own  equity capital.   Equity Capital Required as a Percentage of Total Platform Portfolio (“ECR Ratio”) - The Company defines equity capital required as a percentage of total platform portfolio as equity capital required, as defined above, as a  percentage of total platform portfolio, as defined above.

Non-GAAP sales and marketing expense is presented because the Company believes  that it is a useful financial measure to both the Company and investors of its sales and marketing activities and that it  facilitates period to period comparisons of the Company's sales and marketing as the items excluded generally are not a  function of the Company's operating performance. Non-GAAP Technology and Data Analytics Expense - The Company defines non-GAAP technology and data analytics  expense as GAAP technology and data analytics expense, excluding: (a) depreciation and amortization; (b) stock-based  compensation included in GAAP operating loss; and (c) certain other costs as set forth in the reconciliation of adjusted  operating income (loss) to GAAP operating loss included in the tables at the end of this letter.

Non-GAAP Other Operating Expenses - The Company defines non-GAAP operating expenses as the aggregate of  non-GAAP sales and marketing expense, non-GAAP technology and data analytics expense, and non-GAAP general and  administrative expense. Each of these components is calculated as the corresponding GAAP expense category, excluding:  (a) depreciation and amortization; (b) stock-based compensation included in GAAP operating loss; (c) the expense related  to warrants and share-based payments granted to enterprise partners; and (d) certain other costs as set forth in the  reconciliation of adjusted operating income (loss) to GAAP operating loss included in the tables at the end of this letter.  Non-GAAP operating expenses are presented because the Company believes that they are useful financial measures to  both the Company and investors, facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s core operating expenses, as  the items excluded generally do not reflect the underlying performance of the Company's ongoing operations. Supplemental Performance Indicators Active Merchants - The Company defines an active merchant as a merchant which has a contractual point-of-sale  relationship with Affirm or a platform partner, and engages in at least one Affirm transaction during the twelve months prior  to the measurement date.

Funding Capacity - The Company defines funding capacity as the total amount of committed funding provided by  warehouse credit facilities, securitizations, and forward flow loan sale agreements available for the purchase or financing  of loans. Funding capacity also includes the utilized portion of uncommitted forward flow loan sale agreements as of the  measurement date.

Delinquencies - The Company defines delinquency as when a payment on a loan becomes more than 4 days past due.  The Company generally views delinquency in groupings of more than 30 days past due, more than 60 days past due, and  more than 90 days past due.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in  accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"), the Company presents the  following non-GAAP financial measures: transaction costs, transaction costs as a percentage of GMV, revenue less  transaction costs, revenue less transaction costs as a percentage of GMV, non-GAAP sales and marketing expense,  non-GAAP general and administrative expense, adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted operating margin, total platform  portfolio, equity capital required, and equity capital required as a percentage of total platform portfolio. Definitions of these  non-GAAP financial measures are included under "Key Operating Metrics, Non-GAAP Financial Measures and  Supplemental Performance Indicators" above, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures with the most  directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the tables below. Summaries of the reasons why the Company believes that the presentation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures  provides useful information to the Company and investors are included under "Key Operating Metrics, Non-GAAP  Financial Measures and Supplemental Performance Indicators" above. In addition, the Company uses these non-GAAP  financial measures in conjunction with financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP for planning purposes,  including the preparation of its annual operating budget, and for evaluating the effectiveness of its business strategy.  However, these non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only, and these  non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. Some of these limitations are as follows: ● Revenue less transaction costs and revenue less transaction costs as a percentage of GMV are not intended to be  measures of operating profit or loss as they exclude key operating expenses such as technology and data analytics,  sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses; ● Adjusted operating income (loss) and adjusted operating margin exclude certain recurring, non-cash charges such as  depreciation and amortization, the expense related to warrants and share-based payments granted to enterprise  partners, and share-based compensation expense, which have been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future,  significant recurring expenses; and ● Other companies, including companies in the same industry, may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures  differently from how the Company calculates them or not at all, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative  measure. Accordingly, investors should not consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of  the Company's financial results as reported under GAAP, and these non-GAAP measures should be considered along with  other operating and financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to  review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most  directly comparable GAAP financial measures and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the business. 19Affirm FQ4’24 Shareholder Letter

 Inside Affirm Holdings, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
However, despite these improvements, uncertainties remain in the macroeconomic environment, especially with regard to persistent inflation and the potential for increased unemployment rates.



 Other - Other   Highlight
Adverse events that occur during our second fiscal quarter could have a disproportionate effect on our financial results for the fiscal year.

 Other - Other   Highlight
We have made an accounting policy election to not measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables.

 Legal - Other   Highlight
In addition, we are supervised by the CFPB, which enables it, among other things, to conduct comprehensive and rigorous examinations to assess our compliance with consumer financial protection laws, which in turn could result in matters requiring attention, enforcement investigations and actions, regulatory fines and mandated changes to our business products, policies and procedures.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
In the event that our loans outperform expectation and/or we reduce our expectation of credit losses in future periods, we may release reserves and thereby reduce the allowance for credit losses, yielding income in the provision for credit losses.
