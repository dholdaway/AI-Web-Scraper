Description


Alastair Mailer





          2006-10-19 15:42:27 UTC
        

The www-client/seamonkey-1.0.5 package has possible useflags:

crypt ipv6 java -debug -gnome -ldap 
> -mozcalendar -mozdevelop 
> -moznocompose -moznoirc -moznomail -moznoroaming
 -postgres -xinerama -xprint

The two rows marked with '>' are inconsistent: Either mozno* flags should be changed to moz* flags (i.e. moznocompose -> mozcompose; my preferred method) or vice versa. Having both schemes causes confusion and compilation of features not wanted in the build (e.g. if seamonkey is only being used as a lightweight browser for eclipse, for example).

emerge gentoolkit; euse -i <flag>

The no* flags can't be changed until per-package default flags are in place.
