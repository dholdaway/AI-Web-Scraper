Check 'eselect boost', just in case.
Attach full build log.

# eselect boost list
Available boost versions:
  [1]   boost-1.46/default
  [2]   boost-1.47/default
  [3]   boost-1.48/default
  [4]   boost-1.49/default *

# eselect boost set 4

Same result...

I would seem, that this is the problem, that has been fixed by -r1.

The -r0 ebuild plainly states it wants the correct older boost in DEPEND, but obviously doesn't (perhaps shouldn't) use eselect boost to set that.

dev-python/tagpy-0.94.8-r1 works for me with amd64 and boost-1.49.

ok, no answer yet. So I will close this bug now, because it works for me. But feel free to reopen...
