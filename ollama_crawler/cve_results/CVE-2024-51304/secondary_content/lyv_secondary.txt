 Inside Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such difference could be material.



 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
As a result, our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Should the counterparty to our interest rate hedge agreement default on its obligation, we could experience higher interest rate volatility during the period of any such default.

 Other - Other   Highlight
It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings.

 Other - Other   Highlight
