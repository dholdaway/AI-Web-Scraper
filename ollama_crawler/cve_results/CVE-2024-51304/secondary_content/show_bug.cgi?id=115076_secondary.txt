Accessing to package list for a single day
(http://packages.gentoo.org/daily/yyyy/mm/dd), the HTTP server returns 404
response code, with corrent HTML contents (the package list of the day).
Though Firefox and other major web browsers still show the contents (as error
message page), but some user agent don't.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Access to http://packages.gentoo.org/daily/2005/12/09/
2. See responce code of the page (using Live HTTP headers extension of Firefox,
etc.)


Actual Results:  
The server respond with response code 404.

Expected Results:  
The server respond with response code 200.
