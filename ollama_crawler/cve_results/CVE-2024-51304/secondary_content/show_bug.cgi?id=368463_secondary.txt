Description


Dennis Schridde





          2011-05-23 14:27:15 UTC
        

After installing (and booting) Linux 2.6.39 from sys-kernel/gentoo-sources-2.6.39 via "make modules_install firmware_install install" my wireless adapter stops to work and outputs the following in dmesg:
---
r8712u: Loading firmware from "rtlwifi/rtl8712u.bin"
r8712u: Unable to load firmware
---

The requested firmware is present in sys-kernel/linux-firmware-20110429, which however file-conflicts with a lot of the in-kernel firmware.

New firmware will go into the linux-firmware tree instead of the kernel. linux-firmware is intended to replace the in-kernel firmware.

Yes, please install sys-kernel/linux-firmware.
