Description

- Blockers need to be mutual. When imagemagick blocks perl, perl should block
the  imagemagick version(s) in question.

- I couldn't find a line in the ChangeLog about it: If perl-5.8.7 doesn't work
at all the better blocker would be !~foo. Moreso a blocker would be not needed
in this case, because setting the dependency to <perl-5.8.7 does suffice.
