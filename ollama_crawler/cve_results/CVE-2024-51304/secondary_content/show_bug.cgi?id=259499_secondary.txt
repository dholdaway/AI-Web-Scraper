Description

This looks like an upstream issue, but I wanted to bring it to the gentoo dev's attention.  When using wine-1.1.12 I keep receiving the error "The InstallShield Engine (iKernel.exe) could not be launched." each time I try to install a Windows application that uses InstallShield.

This problem was not in version 1.1.11 and also seems to have been fixed in the latest ~x86 version of wine, 1.1.15 (at the time of this writing).

I have verified this on two machines, both using clean ~/.wine directories.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge =wine-1.1.12
2. Attempt installation of Windows application that uses InstallShield
3.

Actual Results:  
Receive the error: "The InstallShield Engine (iKernel.exe) could not be launched."


Expected Results:  
Application should install normally.

Well, yes, I this that there was a regression in that version,
but the most recent wine today is 1.1.15.
So, considering what wine versions actually are
(git snapshots from every other week), this is more
INVALID than UPSTREAM.

I mentioned it since 1.1.12 is marked stable and 1.1.15 is ~x86, so users who run "stable" systems would be affected by this issue.

If the proper mark is INVALID, that's fine with me...  I just wanted to make the devs aware of the error.

things move from unstable to stable as build functionality is proven.  as for whether wine works as advertised, that is not tracked.  every version of wine changes compatibility with applications and there's no way we could maintain a regression free stable version.
