 Inside Arch Capital Group Ltd.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Legal - Other   Highlight
Therefore, claims for natural and man-made catastrophic events could expose us to large losses and cause substantial volatility in our results of operations, which could cause the value of our common shares to fluctuate widely.



 Other - Other   Highlight
Losses arising from future events will be estimated and recognized at the time the losses are incurred and could be substantial.

 Other - Other   Highlight
The financial results of the property casualty insurance and reinsurance industry are influenced by factors such as the frequency and/or severity of claims and losses, including natural disasters or other catastrophic events, variations in interest rates and financial markets, changes in the legal, regulatory and judicial environments, inflationary pressures and general economic conditions.

 Legal - Other   Highlight
One or more catastrophic or other events could result in claims that substantially exceed our expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations, possibly to the extent of eliminating our shareholders' equity.

 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
In addition to the nature of property business, we believe that economic and geographic trends affecting insured property, including inflation, property value appreciation and geographic concentration, tend to generally increase the size of losses from catastrophic events over time.
