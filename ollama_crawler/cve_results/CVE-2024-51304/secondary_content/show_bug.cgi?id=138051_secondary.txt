Running Firefox 1.0.4 on a Sun Ultra 60. When I try to run an advanced query I get a blank page. Viewing the source of the page shows this message:

WARNING: YOUR BROWSER DOESN'T SUPPORT THIS SERVER-PUSH TECHNOLOGY.

This used to work. I expect the "Bugzilla is pondering your query" page.

I have cookies enabled for the site, and turning on java and javascript made no difference.

This seems to be related to the number of items that the query should return. I get the same thing with the search ALL portage. I'm firefox 1.5.05 on a p4 (x86).

Moving open bugzilla bugs to the new bugzilla group (because I'm about to stab lots of these bugs).

should be resolved on the new bugzilla (I can get 5000 bugs easily).
The server-push message is actually part of the HTTP header.
