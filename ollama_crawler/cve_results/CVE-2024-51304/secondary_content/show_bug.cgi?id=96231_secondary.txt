Description

As the number of use flags increase, and as use flags themselves change or
become deprecated, it would be nice to organize use flags in a "tree" hierarchy.
Perhaps use flags could be in their own file (e.g. /etc/make.conf.use) and
organized much like the kernel's config; for example:

CONFIG_AUDIO
  CONFIG_AUDIO_ARTS
  CONFIG_AUDIO_ESD
CONFIG_VIDEO
  CONFIG_VIDEO_FRAMEBUFFER
    CONFIG_VIDEO_DIRECTFB
    CONFIG_VIDEO_BOOTSPLASH
  CONFIG_X
    CONFIG_DGA
    CONFIG_GLUT

By disabling CONFIG_AUDIO (equivalent to USE="-audio"), the user would know for
sure that things like sound daemons have also been disabled. This reduces the
number of use flags a user has to look at while installing Gentoo, and it also
makes it easier for developers to add/deprecate/change use flags.
