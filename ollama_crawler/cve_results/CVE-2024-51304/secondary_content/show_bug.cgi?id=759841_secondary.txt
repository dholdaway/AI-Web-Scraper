Description

David has been contributing bug fixes and cross-compile fixes for quite a while now.

He completed the ebuild maintainer quiz in less than a day, and has experience maintaining packages for other distro(s).

I think he would be a good fit for Gentoo. Put me down as his mentor for recruitment purposes.

Hi,

I will be your recruiter. Always add a comment to this bug when you send something to that address. Please contact me by IRC or email to schedule the first review session. If you think that recruiters aren't paying attention to this bug at any later point in time, it's your job to ping us on IRC if you don't want any delays.

@floppym: can you provide the information as stated here (https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Recruiters/Mentoring#Filing_a_new_developer_bug) ?

I'll use the nick dm0 like on IRC.

If the interview is over IRC, I could probably do that any time.  I am in the America/New_York time zone.

Reopen no earlier than 3 months. If reopened within 6 months after this waiting period, the process may continue from where we left off.
