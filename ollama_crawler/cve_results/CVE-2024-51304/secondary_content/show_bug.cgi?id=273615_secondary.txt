Current stable unison cannot be used as a remote client. Connection fails with the following message:

$ unison-2.27 test ssh://192.168.1.2/test
bash: unison: command not found
Lost connection with the server

I guess this is because the binary isn't called "unison", but "unison-2.27". Creating a symlink solves the problem:

$ cd /usr/bin
$ ln -s unison-2.27 unison


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install unison-2.27.27-r1 on a remote machine
2. Try to connect to this machine via the remote shell method


Actual Results:  
Connection fails with the following message:

$ unison-2.27 test ssh://192.168.1.2/test
bash: unison: command not found
Lost connection with the server

Expected Results:  
Unison should be found and started at the remote machine.

yes, you should use eselect unison like the unison ebuilds tells.
this is needed because unison versions are slotted.
slot is needed because unison doesn't work well for syncing between different versions.
