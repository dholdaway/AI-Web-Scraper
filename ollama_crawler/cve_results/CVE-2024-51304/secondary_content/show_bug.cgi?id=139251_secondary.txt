I was wondering, what is USE=kde (or better -kde) good for. In ebuild is mentioned:

# kde: enables compilation of the konqueror sidebar plugin

But if watching .configure carefully, here we go:

[ebuild  N    ] media-sound/amarok-1.4.1-r1  USE="aac musicbrainz mysql -arts -debug -ifp -ipod -kde -noamazon -opengl -postgres -real -visualization -xinerama -xmms" LINGUAS="cs -az -bg -br -ca -cy -da -de -el -en_GB -es -et -fi -fr -ga -gl -he -hi -hu -is -it -ja -ka -km -ko -lt -ms -nb -nl -nn -pa -pl -pt -pt_BR -ro -ru -rw -sl -sr -sr@Latn -sv -ta -tg -th -tr -uk -uz -zh_CN -zh_TW" 0 kB
...
...
fast creating po/uk/Makefile
fast creating po/uz/Makefile
fast creating po/zh_CN/Makefile
fast creating po/zh_TW/Makefile
config.pl: fast created 119 file(s).
config.status: creating config.h
config.status: executing depfiles commands

and Konqueror Sidebar is builded then. Nothing important, but I am reporting it to clean things. Thanks, Diego

Maybe this should be in a new bug, but I've just tried emerging amarok with USE=-kde, on a machine without kde installed.

amarok crashes after the startup splashscreen (or after selection of directories to search for music) with the following error message:

QLayout: Adding KToolBar/mainToolBar (child of QVBox/unnamed) to layout for PlaylistWindow/PlaylistWindow
KCrash: Application 'amarokapp' crashing...
Could not find 'drkonqi' executable.
KCrash cannot reach kdeinit, launching directly.

needless to say drkonqi is present on systems with kde installed 
max@nirvana ~ $ equery belongs /usr/kde/3.5/bin/drkonqi
[ Searching for file(s) /usr/kde/3.5/bin/drkonqi in *... ]
kde-base/kdebase-3.5.2-r2 (/usr/kde/3.5/bin/drkonqi)
fwiw

Further to this, I've just emerged amarok with USE=kde

However, the packages that have been brought in (kdebase-data and konqueror)

[I] kde-base/konqueror (3.5.2): KDE: Web browser, file manager, ...
[I] kde-base/kdebase-data (3.5.2): Icons, localization data and various .desktop files from kdebase. Includes the l10n, pics and applnk subdirs.

(there amay be more)

do not produce a drkonqi binary.

Is the solution to also depend oSoln (I think):

it should also depend on drkonqi, which is available as a separate package?

Pretty much anything in KDE tries to call drkonqi when it crashes. It's not required to run Amarok, only to do something pretty when it crashes, so it's not a dependency. Something else must be causing yours to nuke itself.

No idea what's this about.
