AI-powered next-gen code review
Best GitHub Alternative Pull Request Review Tool

A lot has changed since GitHub's pull request review tool was first introduced. See what you're missing.





Security-first, GDPR-compliant


Trusted by banks and healthcare

ðŸ”­ Read less code, better


Built by and used daily by a team of developers that are intimately familiar with how quickly minutes bleed
into hours when reviewing code.



Attention to the code changes that really matter

Every diff tool since the beginning of diff tools has cataloged code changes as either "addition" or "deletion."


GitClear digs deeper. It recognizes the broader set of changes that real developers do:




Move



Update



Copy/paste



Find/replace



End result? 30% less code to review. Instead of scrutinizing moved code as if it were newly added and deleted, code
reviewers can train their limited time on the most significant changed lines.















Github.
Attention consumed equally by moved and changed lines





GitClear.
Moved lines de-emphasized, 30% less code to review







AI summaries and completions

Get the gist for what changed in a file before diving into it. Skip files that don't need your attention.


Accelerate commenting with history-aware completions that remove redundant explanations to
developers who habitually struggle in a particular area.











Swap between viewing changes since last review (default), and all changes in the PR


Review the new&nbspâœ¨

Traditional PR review tools show the full changeset for each file regardless of what you've reviewed
before. GitClear remembers what changes you have previously seen, and by default, only presents the
changes to each file since you last saw it.

GitClear 2024 Pull Request Research

We tasked 50 developers with reviewing a sample PR across various git providers. Then we processed
12,000 pull requests to confirm an unusual result.

Lift beyond a better diff



Prevent tech debt before it begins





Set targets for how much work should be spent toward contributing tests and documentation
for the changes in a PR. Authors can see how their PRs stack up to the team's goals,
the team's past performance, and the performance of similar PRs in the industry.




Proven to reduce review time





In empirical studies where developers reviewed the same pull requests on GitHub and GitClear,
the average developer spent 29% less time reviewing code, without a reduction in identified problems.






Never wonder who's next



Like Critique, GitClear highlights the next action that needs to happen to get a pull request across the
finish line. Also like Critique, GitClear categorizes the size of the PR to help reviewers pick the right
PR for their circumstances.




Pinpoint change origins



When a pull request spans more than a few commits, it can be hard to tell where a change originated.
GitClear's line explanations show the commit that introduced a line, and the commit that last touched it.






Problem detection



The life of a pull request doesn't end upon merge. GitClear follows the meaningful changes that
are made to a pull request in the immediate aftermath of its merge. Teams that follow this metric can
reduce the prevalence of follow-on bugs and regressions.




Suggested comments



Coming soon: When you click to leave a comment, GitClear will suggest comment content based on the content
of the line and the history between the reviewer and the author. This feature reduces time spent typing,
and helps authors recognize patterns in feedback.

Compared to Google Critique

Google Critique is a code review tool that is built into Google's internal code review system. GitClear is a
standalone code review tool that can be used with any git provider.


GitClear has incorporated several features from Critique into its design:



List of pull requests pending review.
Each pull request has a column for "Status," "Last action," "Reviewers," "Size" and "Description."


Incremental changes.
Both tools track what files have been reviewed, and when they were reviewed. When the reviewer returns
after subsequent changes, the tool shows only the new changes (unless you request to see already reviewed).


Code quality goals.
Both tools allow you to set goals for how much work should be spent on contributing tests and documentation.



GitClear has also added features that Critique does not (yet) have:



AI summaries and completions.
GitClear provides a summary of what changed in a file before diving into it, and accelerates commenting with
history-aware completions.


Richer diff lexicon.
Changes aren't all about "addition" and "deletion." GitClear recognizes "move," "update," "copy/paste," and "find/replace,"
and de-emphasizes moved lines and whitespace changes.






Research suggests that users of Critique have a 97% user satisfaction rate
