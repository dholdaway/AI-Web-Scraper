I approve. Assuming we get the required number of votes, I can get this ordered ASAP.

My approval is conditional at this time.

1) Does Brian have space to install the desk?
2) The desk will remain the property of the foundation, like any other foundation provided equipment (we don't want to upset the IRS)

Does Brian have a preference?
He may have used this sort of thing before and know what works and what doesn't

I just talked to Brian on #gentoo-releng and he is putting together his own standing destk so one from the foundation is not needed.
