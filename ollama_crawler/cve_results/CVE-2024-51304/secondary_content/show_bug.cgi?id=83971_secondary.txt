my machine is on a subnetwork behind older routing/commuting hardware. after bringing up eth0, it actually takes several seconds for the line to be useable.  my problem is that the ntp-client service attempts to start up before the line is ok, and ntpdate fails.  I seem to be able to "fix" the problem by inserting the command "/usr/bin/host www.w3.org > /dev/null" just before the invocation of ntpdate.  I don't know what the right fix is, but "need net" doesn't quite do the job in my situation.

how is your net.eth0 configured ?  static ip ?  dhcp ?  adsl ?  ppp ?

i'd suggest you add some kind of sleep with the postup() function in your /etc/conf.d/net ... read /etc/conf.d/net.example for more info

ahem... there's no such thing as /etc/conf.d/net.example
in fact there doesn't appear to be a net.example file anywhere

then you're using baselayout-1.9.x ... upgrade to baselayout-1.11.x if you care to
