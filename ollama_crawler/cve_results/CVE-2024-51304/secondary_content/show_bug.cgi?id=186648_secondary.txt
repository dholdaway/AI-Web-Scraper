System may be AMD64x2 but am compiling as 32bit stable with portage, baselayout , bin-utils keyworded.

emerge openoffice-2.2.1 fails with following error:-

//snip/
checking whether to build with Java support... yes
checking the installed JDK... configure: error: JDK is too old, you need at least 1.3
make: *** [stamp/build] Error 1

and of course, the output of emerge --info

I have checked my java config with 'java-check-environment' and  'java-check-environment virtual_provides' and all is OK
I have the JDK's v1.4, 1.5 and JRE 1.6 installed 

I have checked STLport, is at v5.1.2 supposed to be OK
dev-java/ant-* and jaxme are not installed on my machine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.emerge -av openoffice
2.fails emerge
3.checked Java, still fails

BTW, this time around I am trying a pure Gnome system.  Have also got Compiz-fusion from 'xeffects' overlay installed.

So how is that possible? dev-java/ant-core is a required dependency for building OOo with java-support

Oops, my mistake, I did an "emerge -s ant" and got a large stream of 'ant-' stuff, all of showing not installed.  I didn't go to the top of the list (out of screen) and check.  I have checked it this time specifically and it is there
* dev-java/ant-core-1.7.0.

I seem to have fixed it on my machine, not sure how, but it is working now.

Steps taken;

1) Re-merged 'emerge -N sun-jdk-1.4 sun-jdk-1.5 java-wrapper java-config'
   (-N was in case something had changed in the env. from other installs)
2) Re-booted machine.
3) Emerged openoffice-2.2.1

It took nearly five hours, but is now installed.

I don't know what was borked on the original system, but it seems OK now.  What happens now?  Do you close it as fixed, or do we still try and find what caused the original problem.
