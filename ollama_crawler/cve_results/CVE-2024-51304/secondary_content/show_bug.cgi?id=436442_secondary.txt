Description


Eric F. GARIOUD

Apart from fiddling ebuild's names or directory names, that is to say escaping from the canonical procedure concerning the installation of kernel sources via emerge, it is currently impossible to make two distributions of the same kernel version cohabit in /usr/src.

This facility could be interesting when the files installed depends on useflag settings.

As of today, thinking of the deblob useflag, one could see some interest in having for example a /usr/src/whatever-xyzt instance together with a /usr/src/whatever-xyzt-deblob instance.

OK, the interest would probably not last long with the sole deblob use flag, but we can think of other possible useflags commanding the ebuild to selectively apply patchsets as it has been the case with the ck-sources and the ck-server useflag.

With this possibility, the standard user would be able to get a /usr/src/linux-x.y.z-ck with the distribution emerged USE=-ck-server and a /usr/src/linux-x.y.z-ck-ck-server fo the distribution emerged USE=+ck-server, this as an example.

So I think it would be just great if an ebuild could set some K_whatever variable that kernel-2.eclass could use as a suffix for the directory name to install the distribution in.

Reproducible: Always

EXTRAVERSION does this automatically based on PN by default.

You are absolutely correct.
However, this is not exactly a user tuneable.
I mean users making their sources the standard way that is emerge *sources + patching thanks to epatch facilities cannot customize the installation directory.

OK, they can write their own ebuild in their local overlay but this is another job. I mean at least requiring a knowledge of the eclass (I've not seen EXTRAVERSION documented anywhere else) which is a little far away from the user's preoccupations.

Never mind, this was a very minor request, thank you anyway for having cared.
