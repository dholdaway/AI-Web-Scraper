 Inside Box Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Income   Highlight
A release of a valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and material income tax benefit in the period of release.



 Revenue - Geography   Highlight
Worsening economic conditions, including impacts from inflation, higher interest rates, slower growth, the stronger dollar versus foreign currencies, particularly the Japanese Yen, the ongoing Hamas-Israel and Russia-Ukraine conflicts and other changes in economic conditions, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance.

(Benefit from) provision for income taxes consists primarily of state and foreign income taxes and, as applicable, changes in our deferred taxes, related valuation allowance positions and uncertain tax positions.

 Other - Other   Highlight
We released $79.1 million of our valuation allowance associated with the UK deferred tax assets.

 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Billings are recognized when invoiced, while the related subscription and premier services revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term as we satisfy a performance obligation.
