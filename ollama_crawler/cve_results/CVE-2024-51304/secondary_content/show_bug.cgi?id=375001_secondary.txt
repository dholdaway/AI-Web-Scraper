I have subscribed to several of the gentoo mailinglists. This example covers gentoo-user; when I send any mail to one of these lists they do not show up - neither in my Inbox, nor in the archives at http://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-user/ . 
I send the last mail from the address marc.richter.1982@googlemail.com with the subject "Re: [gentoo-user] drbd primary standalone ..." on July the 12th 2011,  15:54:45 o'clock.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
I send a mail to gentoo-user@lists.gentoo.org
Actual Results:  
No mail showes up

Expected Results:  
My mails shall arrive

The string: "marc.richter" is not subscribed to any mailing list on our infrastructure.

I can find other email addresses matching your name successfully subscribed to gentoo-user. I guess there is no issue anymore.
