To enable faac(faad), --disable-encoder=aac(--disable-decoder=aac) are required for disable internal aac codec.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. USE="-faac -faad" emerge ffmpeg && ffmpeg -y -i input.aac -f adts output.aac 2>&1 | grep channels
2. USE="faac faad" emerge ffmpeg && ffmpeg -y -i input.aac -f adts output.aac 2>&1 | grep channels
3. (patch applied) USE="faac faad" emerge ffmpeg && ffmpeg -y -i input.aac -f adts output.aac 2>&1 | grep channels
Actual Results:  
1.
    Stream #0.0: Audio: aac, 48000 Hz, 2 channels, s16, 83 kb/s
    Stream #0.0: Audio: aac, 48000 Hz, 2 channels, s16, 64 kb/s
2.
    Stream #0.0: Audio: aac, 48000 Hz, 2 channels, s16, 83 kb/s
    Stream #0.0: Audio: aac, 48000 Hz, 2 channels, s16, 64 kb/s
3.
    Stream #0.0: Audio: libfaad, 48000 Hz, 2 channels, s16, 83 kb/s
    Stream #0.0: Audio: libfaac, 48000 Hz, 2 channels, s16, 64 kb/s

The patch is correct, from the bbs post seems that faad doesn't coexists nicely on purpose, I'm not sure if would be worth fixing it upstream.

actually, you can force the codec you want with -acodec. no need to disable internal codecs for this, its just a matter of what default is used upstream -> worksforme
