Exhibit 99.1​​​​​​​​-8655​​​​FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE​For more information contact:Mandi Hogan(805) 981-8655​LTC REPORTS 2023 FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS AND DISCUSSES RECENT ACTIVITIES-- Company Substantially Reduces Leverage Earlier than Expected to Better Position it for Future Growth --​WESTLAKE VILLAGE, CALIFORNIA, February 15, 2024 -- LTC Properties, Inc. (NYSE: LTC) (“LTC” or the “Company”), a real estate investment trust that primarily invests in seniors housing and health care properties, today announced operating results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023.​​​​​​​​​Three Months Ended​​December 31,​    2023    2022​ (unaudited)​​​​​​​Net income available to common stockholders​$ 28,057​$ 17,809Diluted earnings per common share​$ 0.67​$ 0.44NAREIT funds from operations ("FFO") attributable to common stockholders​$ 23,902​$ 29,218NAREIT diluted FFO per common share​$ 0.57​$ 0.72FFO attributable to common stockholders, excluding non-recurring items​$ 27,463​$ 29,218Funds available for distribution ("FAD")​$ 30,021​$ 30,013FAD, excluding non-recurring items​$ 30,021​$ 30,013​Fourth quarter 2023 financial results were impacted by:●Lower rental revenue due to transitioned portfolios, the repayment of Anthem’s 2022 temporary rent reduction in the 2022 fourth quarter, and property sales, partially offset by rent received from a 2023 second quarter acquisition, and annual rent escalations; ●Higher interest income from financing receivables due to the acquisition of 11 assisted living and memory care communities during the 2023 first quarter, which is being accounted for as a financing receivable in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”);●Higher interest income from mortgage loans resulting from mortgage loan originations in the 2023 first quarter;●Higher interest expense primarily due to a higher outstanding balance on LTC’s revolving line of credit, and higher interest rates, partially offset by scheduled principal paydowns on LTC’s senior unsecured notes; ●Higher transaction costs related to fees incurred on lease transitions and amendments;●A $16.8 million net gain on sale related to nine assisted living communities. See below for further discussion of the sales transactions; and ●A $3.6 million provision for credit losses related to the write-off of a note receivable under the two-year ALG Senior (“ALG”) master lease covering 12 properties (eight in Texas, one in South Carolina, one in Mississippi, one in Florida and one in Georgia). These properties, seven of which were built in the 90s, are primarily located in small rural towns, are non-revenue generating, and were temporarily transitioned to ALG following the COVID pandemic in July 2022, allowing LTC time to find a more permanent solution for the portfolio, as follows:oTwo of the properties located in Mississippi and Florida were sold during 2023. 1The following information was filed by Ltc Properties Inc (LTC) on Thursday, February 15, 2024 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.

 Inside Ltc Properties Inc's 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Concentration risk is valuable to understand what portion of our real estate investments could be at risk if certain sectors were to experience downturns.



 Financial - Debt   Highlight
Inasmuch as we may initially fund some of our investments with variable interest rate debt, we would be at risk of net interest margin deterioration if medium and long-term rates were to increase.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Many of our existing leases contain renewal options that, if exercised, could result in the amount of rent payable upon renewal being greater or less than that currently being paid.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
For the remaining leases in place at December 31, 2023, assuming no modification or replacement of existing leases and no new leased investments are added to our portfolio, except for the potential subsequent lease extensions and the leases reported below under Update on Certain Operators, we currently expect that the non-cash straight-line rent portion of rental income will increase from negative $2.1 million in 2023 to negative $2.5 million for projected annual 2024.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Those factors include, without limitation, the health of the economy, inflation pressures, employee availability and cost, changes in supply of or demand for competing seniors housing and health care facilities, ability to hire and maintain qualified staff, ability to control rising operating costs, and the potential for significant reforms in the health care industry, and the ongoing impact of COVID-19 and related occupancy challenges faced by our industry.
