From ${URL} :

The following security advisory was reported by OpenBSD:

OpenBSD 5.4 errata 8, Apr 12, 2014:  A use-after-free race condition in OpenSSL's read buffer may permit 
an attacker to inject data from one connection into another.

Reference:

http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/5.4/common/008_openssl.patch
http://www.tedunangst.com/flak/post/analysis-of-openssl-freelist-reuse


@maintainer(s): after the bump, in case we need to stabilize the package, please let us know if it is ready for the stabilization or not.

Yeah, not a security threat, but still a very weird way for OpenSSL to handle memory.  Still a bug in my book, but one that can follow normal stabilization procedures when upstream does patch it.
