 Inside Westrock Co's 10-K Annual Report:


 Financial - Cash Flow   Highlight
Cash Flow Activity Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2023 decreased $192.5 million from fiscal 2022 primarily due to lower earnings partially offset by $668.0 million of reduced working capital usage compared to the prior year period.



 Financial - Expense   Highlight
The lower net expense in fiscal 2023 primarily included a favorable $13.7 million impact of foreign currency, a favorable $12.0 million of other non-operating costs and a favorable $7.3 million on the sale of businesses, each as compared to fiscal 2022.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
The favorable other non-operating costs included a $19.7 million gain on foreign currency exchange contract derivatives entered into in anticipation of the Mexico Acquisition, and the favorable sale of businesses included an $11.2 million gain on the sale of our Eaton, IN and Aurora, IL uncoated recycled paperboard mills.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
We expect approximately half of the estimated $0.5 to $0.6 billion investment will represent incremental operating costs to be adjusted in our Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share non-GAAP measures over the course of the project, with substantially all such costs being recorded within selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
The determination of pension obligations and pension expense requires various assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts, such as the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates, projected future compensation increases and mortality rates for each of our plans.
