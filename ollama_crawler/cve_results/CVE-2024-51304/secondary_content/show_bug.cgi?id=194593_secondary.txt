Well, it works for me:
make -fMakefile.ruby install
make[4]: Entering directory `/var/tmp/portage/app-mobilephone/obexftp-0.22_rc9/work/obexftp-0.22/swig/ruby'
mkdir -p /var/tmp/portage/app-mobilephone/obexftp-0.22_rc9/image//usr/lib64/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/x86_64-linux
/usr/bin/install -c -m 0755 obexftp.so /var/tmp/portage/app-mobilephone/obexftp-0.22_rc9/image//usr/lib64/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/x86_64-linux

Other than insufficient space on /mnt/Dati partition, I don't see why it is 'impossibile creare il file normale'.

How about trying to run that install command by hand? I don't really understand what you expect from me.

Ah, I see the following error stats that directory don't exist. Something strange with your mkdir or PATH perhaps?

i did a different try: unmerged old rc7 version and merged rc9 again. seems working now.

so strange.

i close it

i think another problem can be the jobs. i had -j4.

can you filter to 1? should be much safer

According to Makefile.ruby it cannot possibly be a -j problem.

The rule that run install command is install-so and it depends on $(RUBYARCHDIR) which is the rule that runs makedir. 
Can you verify -j4 don't screw things up? I would verify it myself but I don't have a multicore system, hence it is very unlikely it will bite me.
