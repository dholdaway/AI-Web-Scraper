Official Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) Dictionary Statistics
CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages.
Based upon the generic syntax for Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI), CPE includes a formal name format, a method for checking names against a system, and a description format for binding text and tests to a name.
The below statistics capture growth and modification information relating to the official CPE Product Dictionary.
*The CPE Dictionary Team is working to address any discrepancy between the number of processed and received submissions. Some submissions may be delayed because they require a feedback cycle between the CPE Dictionary Team and CPE Dictionary Submitters to ensure consistency within the CPE dictionary.
