Ebuilds for media-video/ffmpeg-0.* and media-video/ffmpeg-1.* use same slot
But some ebuilds (like app-office/odeskteam) require old ffmpeg version for work and can't be installed in same time with ebuilds what require new ffmpeg version (like www-client/chromium with system-ffmpeg use-flag enabled).

Reproducible: Always

Not much to do for ffmpeg: it cant really be slotted. 
At best a slotted "binary" package could be provided like for libpng but it'd be better to have odeskteam use recent versions as I see it unlikely future security fixes will be backported to ffmpeg 0.10, hence such a package would be a maintainance burden.

reassigning to odeskteam maintainer

odeskteam can't use recent version of ffmpeg because it's proprietary software.

prebuilt propietary? then you can package the required old libraries to tarball, and install them from the odeskteam's ebuild to it's own directory so nothing but odeskteam sees it using a wrapper (make_wrapper in eutils.eclass)

like if odeskteam goes to /opt/odeskteam, then you put the libavutil.so.X, libavcodec.so.X, and other required shared libraries to /opt/odeskteam

ie. in other words, the propietary software is not a reason to SLOT ffmpeg, and most definately not worth it

ie. what Comment #1 said
