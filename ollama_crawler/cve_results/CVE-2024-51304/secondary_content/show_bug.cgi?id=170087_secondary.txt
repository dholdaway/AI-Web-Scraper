Trivial to let nfs-utils init.d script run on embedded.

You should drop the [[ and use just [ while putting the results inside within quotes.

that patch is insufficient ... there are plenty more bashisms in there

the nfs init.d will be rewritten anyways, so no point i think in taking this further ...
