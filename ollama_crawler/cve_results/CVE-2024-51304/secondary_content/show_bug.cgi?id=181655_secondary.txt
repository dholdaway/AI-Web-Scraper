Description


Marijn Schouten (RETIRED)

I'd like packages.g.o to include links to relevant ebuilds which can be viewed at sources.g.o.

Example:
http://packages.gentoo.org/ebuilds/?scm-5.5.3
should link to:
http://sources.gentoo.org/viewcvs.py/gentoo-x86/dev-scheme/scm/scm-5.5.3.ebuild?rev=1.3&only_with_tag=MAIN&view=log

There seems to be no interested in this beyond developers.  This would be trivial to implement, but I'm already under the impression that packages.g.o is already too "crowded".

Would you consider scratching this request?

I'd really rather not, but I could start a discussion on dev ml about it if you want. Or you could.

I've given my justifications against it.  Could you provide your justifications for this enhancement?

I'm not on the -dev mailing list.  But see no problem if you would like to start a discussion there.  If you want please refer to this bug report.

It would be extremely handy IMO to have direct access to the ebuild, since it contains a lot of information. Not just for devs, but for users too.

Anyway, considering the price of one link, I'm actually quite surprised this didn't already exist or that I have to explain the usefulness. Is there any good reason for making it cumbersome to reach the actual ebuild code from packages.g.o? Or vice versa to reach p.g.o from sources.g.o? These two sources of information should link to eachother.

I think this would be more useful than the "Similar" link.

Agreed. As a user, I would find this link very useful.

As a Power_user/Arch Tester I would find this feature immensely useful.

In fact, I hate the Similar link as I don't care about similar packages but just what I am looking at.

I would prefer a link to the category/package in sources.gentoo.org (e.g. http://sources.gentoo.org/viewcvs.py/gentoo-x86/app-portage/eix) and not the Changelog but either one works.

Reassigning to the main infra group since Marduk is retired.

The new packages2 does do this.
