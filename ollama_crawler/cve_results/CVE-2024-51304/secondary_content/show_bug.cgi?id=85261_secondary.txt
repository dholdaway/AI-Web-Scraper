when I try to emerge gnome, gcc fails with exit status 1

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.type '#emerge gnome'
2.wait
3.

Actual Results:

src/interface_util/interface_util.c:528: error: `GL_UNPACK_SWAP_BYTES'

!!! Function distutils_src_compile, Line 38, Exitcode 1
!!! compilation failed
!!! If you need support, post the topmost build error, NOT this status message.

Expected Results:  
'gnome emerged successfully' or something of the like

have had problems with gcc on an identical machine to this one

emerging gimp fails with a similar exit status

KDE has been emerged successfully on this machine, but the aforementioned 'twin
machine' has had problems emerging kde as well as gnome

Dell Dimension XPS D233
Pentium II 266 Mhz processor

Don't assign bugs directly unless you know where they go

Can you pleasse give all the error messages rather than just the last one (paste the log beginning with the last call to gcc).

Also, please run 'opengl-update xorg-x11' before the emerge.

I've had the same problem, it happens when xorg-x11 is built without opengl in USE. The pyopengl ebuild actually says something about missing GL/gl.h before it breaks.

Those are the relevant lines:

On a side note: Did Kory post additional information to the bug just when I did? Because Bugzilla said something along those lines, and I chose the option to revert my changes to double check what I had written. But now there's no new comment by Kory, but mine's still there. Either I'm confused, or it's a bug in bugzilla. Considering that name, it's probably the former;)

have you tried running 'opengl-update xorg' and trying again? seems like you might of installed X but the GL headers weren't placed in the right place? also env-update probably wouldn't hurt either.

I get the same error while trying to emerge dev-python/pyopengl-2.0.0.44;
anyway, "opengl-update xorg-x11" resolves the problem.

I had the exact same problem and gleaned enough info from this thread to fix it.
 I did: 

1) Added 'opengl' to my use flags. 
2) Re-emerged xorg-x11 
3) ran 'opengl-update xorg-x11'
4) emerged dev-python/pyopengl

I also did a 'revdep-rebuild' earlier for good measure.  Not sure if all of
these are necessary, but this is what I did.

Virtuals aren't actual packages, but rather an abstraction that says multiple packages can resolve that given dependency.

In this case, you may have either media-libs/freeglut or media-libs/glut installed.  See which one you have and re-merge it.

I have had issues with media-libs/glut before, so try freeglut if you have glut installed.  You'll have to unmerge glut first.
