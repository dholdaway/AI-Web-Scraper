 Inside Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Revenue - Product   Highlight
Coal revenues decreased $636.4 million, or 15.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period.



 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $10.8 million, or 15.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period.

 Financial - Income   Highlight
The effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to favorable permanent differences for the percentage depletion allowance and the foreign-derived intangible income deduction.

 Financial - Expense   Highlight
Cost of coal sales increased $70.2 million, or 3.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period as a result of increased costs due to inflationary pressure and increased levels of coal purchases partially offset by lower royalties, taxes, and freight and handling costs due to the lower coal pricing environment.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Moreover, this measure is not calculated identically by all companies and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
