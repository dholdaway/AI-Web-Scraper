Description

while updating today I got this error message on every g-cpan related ebuild:

"EAPI=2 is not supported by perl-module.eclass"

I found that all other perl ebuild are upgraded to EAPI >= 4, because of some internal redesigns.

At that point I'd assume that g-cpan -u would upgrade all ebuilds to fit that constraint.

But it didn't. I found no way to tell g-cpan to recreate his ebuilds to fir structural needs.

The only way for me was to remove all packages managed by g-cpan, delete all contents of /usr/local/perl-gcpan/ and reinstall everything

Would it be nice to have a switch to force recreation of that ebuild and reinstallation?


Reproducible: Always

Yes, maybe option like '--force' would be nice to have.

As workaround you will try:

$ source /etc/make.conf && find $GCPAN_OVERLAY/perl-gcpan -name '*.ebuild' -exec rm '{}' + && g-cpan -gvu
