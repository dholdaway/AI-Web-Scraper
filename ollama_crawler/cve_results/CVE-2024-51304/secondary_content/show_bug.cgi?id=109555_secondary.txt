As described <a
href="https://a248.e.akamai.net/f/674/9448/0/www2.ati.com/drivers/linux/linux_8.18.6.html#178274
>here </a> under Section minimum >requirements the fglrx driver does not need
agpgart, and in some case Chipsets are not supported by agpgart but supported by
fglrx internal agp module it should be possible to install ati-drivers without
agpgart enabled in Kernel

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.configure your Kernel without agpgart
2.emerge ati-drivers
3.look at the message portage gives you

Actual Results:  
error ati-drivers no agpgart support

Expected Results:  
pass and use fglrx internal agp support (auto-detected)

AFAIK these three lines should be removed from the ebuild:

ebegin "Checking for AGP support enabled"
    linux_chkconfig_present AGP
eend $?

It just issues warnings. I'll change the message even I warmly suggest to use
the kernel agpgart.

I am against this as pcie cards are supported and do not require agpgart.
Requiring a user to build agpgart in the kernel is not what I call sane decision
exspecially when they do not want/need it.

As of late without AGPGART enabled in the kernel symbols will not be resolved at time of loading module. The check is nessary and should be left as is.

The checks in current ebuilds look just fine (and are non-fatal anyway). Closing this.
