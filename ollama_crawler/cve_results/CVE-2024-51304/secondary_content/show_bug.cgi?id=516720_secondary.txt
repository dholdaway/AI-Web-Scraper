This is possibly gcc-4.9 related

I've tried with O2 and using bfd as well as gold

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge llvm




I'm not seeing anything obvious in the logs

Ah that patch didn't fix it at all

I did notice that the abi specific source directories didn't have a lib/CodeGen directory 

Is that possibly the issue?

This is the latest failure - seems to be an ICE in g++
