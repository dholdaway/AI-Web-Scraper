 Inside Tenable Holdings, Inc.'s 10-K Annual Report:


 Other - Other   Highlight
Our evaluation of valuation allowances could change in the future and the impact could have a material impact on our financial statements.



 Financial - Expense   Highlight
The level and timing of investment in these areas could affect our cost of revenue in the future.

 Other - Other   Highlight
Additionally, we are currently in negotiations to sublease a portion of our real estate, which could result in a non-cash impairment charge of $6 million to $7 million in 2024.

 Financial - Earnings   Highlight
Depending on the jurisdiction, distributions of earnings could be subject to withholding taxes at rates applicable to the distributing jurisdiction.

 Other - Other   Highlight
We expect to maintain this full valuation allowance for the foreseeable future as it is more likely than not that some or all of those deferred tax assets may not be realized based on our history of losses.
