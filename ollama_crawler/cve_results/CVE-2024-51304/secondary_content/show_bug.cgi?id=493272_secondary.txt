Description


Alexander Dubov

Problem observed with wine versions 1.6, 1.7.4, stock ebuilds (compiled with gcc-4.7.2 and gcc-4.8.1) and paxctl-0.7-r2 on amd64.


Upon application of paxctl flags (via pax-mark statement in the ebuild) both wine-preloader and wine64-preloader binaries become corrupt, resulting in wine crashing early on load.

Mitigation: commented out pax-mark statements in the ebuild, wine emerges and works just fine. Also, manually confirmed that paxctl corrupts the wine(64)-preloader binary.

Cannot reproduce here :/

Please attach your "emerge --info wine" output, and explain exactly what you mean by corrupted.

By "corrupted" I mean executable that crashes immediately on execve (this is what would happen to wine-preloader).

It seems I can not reproduce this problem either. I upgraded a handful of packages on that machine and paxctl now seem to work without further problems.

OK, marking as "worksforme" then. If you see this problem again, reopen the bug.
