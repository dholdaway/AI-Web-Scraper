Introduction
 The Cisco NX-OS software for the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series fulfills the routing, switching, and storage networking requirements of data centers and provides an Extensible Markup Language (XML) interface and a command-line interface (CLI) similar to Cisco IOS software.


System Requirements
 This section includes the following topics:

 Memory Requirements
 Supported Device Hardware


Memory Requirements
 Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2 software requires 8 GB of memory. If you have a Cisco Nexus 7000 Series system with a Supervisor 1 module with 4 GB of memory, you must upgrade to 8 GB of memory using the memory upgrade kit, N7K-SUP1-8GBUPG=, before you install Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2.
 Instructions for upgrading to the new memory are available in the “Upgrading Memory for Supervisor Modules” section of the  Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Hardware Installation and Reference Guide.  


Supported Device Hardware
 The Cisco NX-OS software supports the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series that includes Cisco Nexus 7000 switches and Cisco Nexus 7700 switches. You can find detailed information about supported hardware in the    Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Hardware Installation and Reference Guide . 
  Table 2  shows the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series hardware supported by Cisco NX-OS Release 6.x, Release 5.x, and Release 4.x software.
  Table 3  shows the FEX modules supported by the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series I/O modules.
  Table 4  shows the service modules supported by the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switches.
  Table 5  shows the transceiver devices supported by each release.
 For a list of minimum recommended Cisco NX-OS software releases for use with Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switches, see the document  Minimum Recommended Cisco NX-OS Releases for Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches.

ISSU Upgrade Steps
 To perform an ISSU upgrade to Release 6.2(x) from one of the ISSU supported releases listed in  Table 6 , follow these steps: 
  1. Enter the  show running-config aclmgr inactive-if-config command for all VDCs.
  2. Enter the  clear inactive-config acl command for all VDCs.
  3. If the configuration has any  mac packet-classify configurations on any interfaces, remove all of the configurations by entering the  no mac packet-classify command.
  4. If there is an VACL configuration and the ISSU to Release 6.2(2a) is from a release earlier than Release 6.1(3), perform the ISSU in two steps:
  a. Upgrade to Release 6.1(3) or Release 6.1(4).
  b. Upgrade from Release 6.1(3) or Release 6.1(4) to Release 6.2(2a).
  5. Start the ISSU procedure.


Non-ISSU Upgrade Steps
 To perform a non-ISSU upgrade to Release 6.2(x) from any release earlier than Release 6.2(x), follow these steps:
  1. Change the boot variable.
  2. Enter the copy running-config startup-config vdc-all command.
  3. Enter the  reload command to reload the switch.




Note Allow time after the reload for the configuration to be applied. 








Note For traditional upgrades to any other Release of 62x or 61x, we can simply save config and reload.




 Due to CSCui37100, to perform a non-ISSU upgrade to Release 6.2(2a) or 6.2(2) from any release earlier than the Release 6.2(2a) / 6.2(2), follow these steps:
  1. Enter the  show running-config aclmgr inactive-if-config command for all VDCs.
  2. Enter the  clear inactive-config acl command for all VDCs.
  3. Change the boot variable to boot Release 6.2(2) or 6.2(2a).
  4. Enter the copy running-config startup-config vdc-all command. 
  5. Enter the  reload command to reload the switch.




Note Allow time after the reload for the configuration to be applied. 




  6. Once all line cards come up, enter the  show running-config aclmgr command in all VDCs.
  7. Enter the  clear inactive-config acl command for all VDCs.
  8. Enter the  copy boot flash:/vdc_x/aclmgr-inactive-config.cfg running-config command for all VDCs. 
 For complete instructions on upgrading your software, see the  Cisco Nexus 7000 Series NX-OS Upgrade Downgrade Guide.  
 Non-ISSU upgrades are also referred to as a cold boot.

Non In-Service Software Downgrade (non-ISSU)/Cold Boot Downgrade Steps
 Instructions provided below list the steps for the cold boot (non-ISSU) downgrade. This is an example of a cold boot downgrade of a switch that is running Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(16) and needs to reload with Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2 (12). 

 Save the switch configuration.

 – Enter  copy running-config bootflash:<config.txt> vdc-all  command.

 Change the boot variable to boot the target release.
 Enter  copy running-config startup-config vdc-all command to save the boot variable.
 Enter  write erase command to erase running configuration on the switch.
 Enter  reload command.

 Once the switch and all the modules are up with the target image, do the following:

 Enter the copy bootflash:<config.txt> running-config command.
 Verify that the switch is configured correctly.
 Replay the configuration copy to check if fex interfaces exist.

 – Enter the  copy bootflash:<config.txt> running-config command.


Upgrade or Downgrade Caveats
 A software upgrade or downgrade can be impacted because of the following caveats:

 When you upgrade from Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(20) to Cisco NX-OS Release 7.3(2)D1(2) or downgrade from Cisco NX-OS Release 7.3(2)D1(2) to Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(20), the ACL policy on virtual teletype (VTY) may not get activated during quiet period. You need to reconfigure the appropriate 'block-for' and the 'quiet-mode' configurations so that the ACL on VTY works properly.   The following example shows how to reconfigure the 'block-for' and the 'quiet-mode' configurations in Cisco NX-OS Release 7.3(2)D1(2):


system login block-for 20 attempts 1 within 30


system login quiet-mode access-class foo

  
 The following example shows how to reconfigure the 'block-for' and the 'quiet-mode' configurations in Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(20):

login block-for 20 attempts 1 within 30


login quiet-mode access-class foo

  

 When you perform ISSU to Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(16) from earlier Cisco NX-OS 6.x releases, you need to reload the F2 module or the switch to avoid congestion in the ingress traffic on ports in a F2 module.
 ASCII Configuration Replay

 Saving VLAN Configuration Information:
 Because a VLAN configuration can be learned from the network while the VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) is in a server/client mode, the VLAN configuration is not stored in the running configuration. If you copy the running configuration to a file and apply this configuration at a later point, including after a switch reload, the VLANs will not be restored. However, the VLAN configuration will be erased if the switch is the only server in the VTP domain.
 The following steps list the workaround for this limitation:
 – Configure one of the clients as the server.
 – Complete the following steps:

 Copy the VTP data file to the bootflash: data file by entering the  copy vtp-datafile bootflash: vtp-datafile command.
 Copy the ASCII configuration to the startup configuration by entering the copy ascii-cfg-file startup-config command.
 Reload the switch with Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2) or a later release.

 This limitation does not apply to a binary configuration, which is the recommended approach, but only to an ASCII configuration. In addition, this limitation applies to all Cisco NX-OS software releases for the Cisco Nexus 7000 series.
 Rebind Interfaces command is not automatically executed when Replaying ASCII configuration in Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(x):
 The  rebind interfaces command introduced in Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2) is needed to ensure the proper functionality of interfaces in certain circumstances. The command might be required when you change the module type of a VDC. However, because of the disruptive nature of the  rebind interfaces  command, for Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(x) prior to Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(8), this limitation applies only when all of the following conditions are met:

 The ASCII configuration file is replayed in the context of the default VDC or the admin VDC, and at least one VDC has an F2e Series or an F3 Series module listed as supported module types either before or after the replay.
 The  limit-resource module-type  commands listed in the ASCII configuration file requires that  rebind interfaces command be executed.

 The following steps list the workaround for this limitation:

 Manually enter the  rebind interfaces command wherever needed to the ASCII configuration file for replay.
 Enter the  rebind interfaces command immediately after you enter the  limit-resource module-type command.
 Ensure that the ASCII replay properly applies all interface configurations for all interfaces in the relevant VDCs.





Note If you boot up the switch without any startup configuration, this limitation might apply to an ASCII replay. The reason is that without a startup configuration, the default VDC might still have certain interfaces automatically allocated. Because of this possibility, follow the approaches to work around the limitation.





 When you perform an ISSU to Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(8)/6.2(8a)/6.2(8b) from an earlier release, the service “pixm_vl” in the switch might crash. Make sure that you review all the Upgrade/Downgrade issues in the “Resolved Caveats” section of the respective releases.
 All interfaces are moved to unallocated VDC (VDC 0) after you perform a disruptive software upgrade from Cisco NX-OS Release 5.2.x to Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2.x. Workaround to this issue is; you need to manually assign the interfaces back to the default VDC (VDC 1). This limitation is applicable to Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(16).
 Reload based NXOS downgrades involve rebuilding the internal binary configuration from the text based startup configuration. This is done to ensure compatibility between the binary configuration and the downgraded software version. As a result, certain specific configuration may be missing from the config, after downgrade, due to ASCII replay process. This would include FEX HIF port configuration and VTP database configuration. Furthermore, NXOS configurations that require VDC or switch reload to take effect may require additional reload when applied during the downgrade process. Examples of this include URIB/MRIB shared memory tuning, custom reserved VLAN range and Fabricpath Transit Mode feature. In order to mitigate this during downgrade, you should copy your full configuration to bootflash/tftpserver. 
 The online diagnostics tests PortLoopbackTest, SnakeLoopbackTest, RewriteEngineText, and BootupPortLoopbackTest are not supported on the N77-F348XP-23 module.


 Feature Support

 Any features introduced in a release must be disabled before downgrading to a release that does not support those features. 

 Unsupported Modules

 When manually downgrading from Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2) to an earlier release, first power down all modules that are unsupported in the downgrade image. Then, purge the configuration of the unsupported modules using the purge module  module_number  running-config command.

 The Intelligent Traffic Director (ITD) Configuration is Lost After an Upgrade or Downgrade

 The ITD configuration is not saved during an in-service software upgrade (ISSU) from Release 6.2(8) or Release 6.2(8a) to Release 6.2(10) or an in-service software downgrade (ISSD) to Release 6.2(8a) or Release 6.2(8). Before performing an ISSU or ISSD, you must remove the ITD configuration by using the  no feature itd command. After the upgrade or downgrade, you must manually reapply the configuration.

 OTV AED Displays a Version Mismatch After an Upgrade

 If your OTV setup includes dual Authoritative Edge Devices (AEDs), the output of the  show otv command displays a Version Mismatch after you perform an upgrade to from Release 6.1.X to Release 6.2.x because one AED is upgraded to 6.2.x and second AED is still running Release 6.1.x or an earlier release. This behavior is expected. For example:

otv# show otv

 The Auto-Recovery Disable and Auto-Recovery Timeout Configurations Might not be Persistent Across an Upgrade, Downgrade, or Reload.

 Before Cisco NX-OS 6.2(2), the auto-recovery default was disabled. In Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2) and later releases, auto recovery is enabled by default. Because the default behavior of auto recovery is changed, the following caveats apply:
 – After you perform an ISSU to Release 6.2(2) or a later release, auto recovery is enabled by default after the upgrade. If you want to disable auto recovery in Release 6.2(2) or a later release, you must use the  no auto-recovery  command to explicitly disable auto recovery.
 – After you perform a downgrade from Release 6.2(6) or 6.2(4a) to Release 6.2(2), auto recovery is enabled by default after the downgrade regardless of the auto-recovery configuration before the downgrade. If you want to disable auto recovery in Release 6.2(2) or a later release, you must use the  no auto-recovery  command to explicitly disable auto recovery.
 – After you reload a device that is running Release 6.2(2), 6.2(4a) or 6.2(6), auto recovery is enabled by default after the reload. If you want to disable auto recovery in Release 6.2(2) or a later release, you must use the  no auto-recovery  command to explicitly disable auto recovery after the reload.
 – If you changed the auto-recovery reload-delay value from the default value in Release 6.2(2), 6.2(4a), or 6.2(6), the value reverts to the default (240sec) after you perform a downgrade to any of the three specified releases and after you reload a device that is running any of the three specified releases. If you want a value other than the default for the auto-recovery reload-delay, you must reconfigure the auto-recovery reload-delay value after the downgrade or the reload.

 Auto Recovery Does not Restore the vPC.

 After a disruptive upgrade or sequential reloads, the Auto Recovery feature does not restore the vPC when the keep-alive and peer-link are down. By design, a disruptive upgrade causes the start-up configuration to run through a different process when it is installed. This issue is seen on sequential reloads until the binary configuration is rebuilt.
 To ensure that auto recovery is successful and the vPC is restored after a disruptive upgrade, use the  save running-config startup-config vdc-all  command after the disruptive upgrade and then reload the device.

 Supervisor CoS2q and DSCP2Q Mappings are Restored to Default Mappings

 After you perform an ISSU to Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(6a) or a later release, one of the following warning messages is displayed:
 –  Supervisor cos2q, dscp2q mappings are restored to default mappings. Please apply cos2q, dscp2q mappings again. For dscp2q mappings, turn off and on dscp global knob. 
 – Supervisor cos2q mappings are restored to default mappings. Please apply cos2q mappings again.
 – Supervisor dscp2q mappings are restored to default mappings. Please turn off and on dscp global knob.
 If you are using the 8e4q4q template in Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(6) or an earlier release and you perform an ISSU to Release 6.2(6a) or a later release, the Class of Service (Cos2q) and differentiated services code point (DSCP2q) maps are restored to the defaults in the supervisor engine. However, because the ISSU is non-disruptive, the mappings are not programmed in the hardware. The next time you save a new configuration, the default mappings are pushed to the module, which is disruptive.
 To avoid this issue, you must explicitly push the COS2q and DSCP2q mappings to the module after the ISSU. 
 If you are not using the 8e4q4q template and you perform an ISSU from Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(6) or an earlier release to Release 6.2(6a) or a later release, you can ignore the warning message; no action is required.

 VDC Ports Can Become Unallocated After a Downgrade

 If your Cisco Nexus 7000 Series device that is running Release 6.2(x) has  f2e in its configuration as a part of the  limit-resource module-type command, some interfaces might become unallocated after a downgrade from Release 6.2(x) to Release 6.1(x) or an earlier release. 
 Because there is no  f2e keyword for the  limit-resource module-type f2 f2e command in releases before Release 6.2(x), the command fails and the VDC is converted to a limit-resource module-type m1 f1 m1xl m2xl VDC. This issue can occur even if you do not have any F2e Series modules in the chassis.
 To avoid this issue, do one of the following procedures:




Note Before any upgrade, save the startup configuration to bootflash.




 – If you have a saved backup of the switch configuration from the release to which you want to downgrade, do the following:
  1. Before downgrading to Release 6.1(x) or an earlier release, change the boot variable to 6.1(x).
  2. Enter the  copy running-config startup-config command to save the boot variable to 6.1(x). 
  3. Enter the  write erase  command on the switch.
  4. Reload the switch with the downgrade image. 
  5. After all I/O modules and supervisor modules come up, enter the  copy  saved-config  running-config command. For example, if your saved configuration is in the file bootflash:saved_config, enter the  copy bootflash:saved_config running-config command. 
 – If you do not have a backup switch configuration from the release to which you want to downgrade, follow these steps to change instances of  f2e to  f2 in the  limit-resource module-type command of the Release 6.2(x) configuration, before reloading the switch:
  1. Copy your release 6.2(x) configuration to a file on a remote server by entering the  copy running-config scp://  command.
  2. In the copied file, find all instances of  f2e in the  limit-resource module-type  f2 f2e command and replace it with  f2. Remove any redundant instances of  f2. For example, if you replace  f2e in the  limit-resource module-type  f2 f2e command, make sure that you change it to  limit-resource module-type  f2.  Save the file.
  3. Enter the  copy running-config startup-config command to save the boot variable to 6.2(x). 
  4. Enter the  write erase  command on the switch.
  5. Reload the switch with the downgrade image. 
  6. After all I/O modules and supervisor modules come up, copy the edited file to your running configuration by entering the  copy  saved-config  running-config command.

 F2e Interfaces Might Become Unallocated After an Upgrade

 All F2e interfaces might become unallocated immediately after an upgrade from Cisco NX-OS Release 6.1(x) to Release 6.2(x). Generally, this situation should not occur if you follow recommended upgrade procedures. However, if you find that all F2e interfaces are unallocated after the upgrade, before doing any further configuration, complete the following steps to fix the problem: 
  1. Retrieve an ASCII version of the complete switch configuration and edit it as follows:
 – Replace every instance of  f2 with  f2 f2e  in any  limit-resource module-type command and  any system module-type command.
  2. When all the modules are online and all the VDCs are created and in active status, in the context of the Default VDC or the Admin VDC, enter the  copy modified-ascii-config running-config echo command to apply the modified ASCII configuration file.
  3. After verifying the sanity of the current configuration in the context of the Default VDC or the Admin VDC, enter the  copy running-config startup-config vdc-all command to save the configuration.

 Storage VDC

 Starting with Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(x), shared interfaces must come from the module types that the storage VDC supports, and having F1 and F2 interfaces shared in the same VDC is not supported. In Release 6.2(x), the vdc command will fail if you attempt to share F2 interfaces with a VDC that supports only F1 (or vice versa).
 In Cisco NX-OS Release 6.1(x), you are allowed to share F2 interfaces with a storage VDC that supports only F1, and you can share F1 interfaces with a storage VDC that supports only F2. But having F1 and F2 shared interfaces in the same storage VDC is somewhat problematic and can potentially cause issues. 
 If you have a Cisco NX-OS Release 6.1(x) configuration that has shared F1 and F2 interfaces in the same storage VDC, this configuration will be allowed temporarily in Release 6.2(x) if you are performing an upgrade through a binary configuration, which is the typical upgrade path, rather than through an ASCII configuration. This temporary situation provides a transition period to update the configuration; however, the functionality of the interfaces is not guaranteed during this time. The configuration might be lost after a switch reboot. In addition, the configuration will fail in Release 6.2(x), if you remove the interface and attempt to add it back to a shared storage VDC. Because of these constraints, we recommend that you remove the combination of shared interfaces before the upgrade to Release 6.2(x), or after it. 
 Before or after an upgrade from Cisco NX-OS Release 6.1(x) to Release 6.2(x), apply either the  limit-resource module-type f1 command or the  limit-resource module-type f2 command to the storage VDC, and check that the following storage VDC configurations are removed:
 – Shared F2 interfaces with a storage VDC that support only F1, or shared F1 interfaces with a storage VDC that supports only F2
 – F1 and F2 interfaces in the same storage VDC

 Upgrade With an M2 Series Module Installed

 In rare instances, if you perform an ISSU from Cisco NX-OS Release 6.1(2) or an earlier release to Release 6.2(x) and you have an M2 or F2 Series module installed in your Cisco Nexus 7000 Series system, the upgrade might fail with the following error:

Return code 0x40710027 (BIOS flash-type verify failed)


 

 To work around this issue, ISSU to Release 6.1(3) before you upgrade to Release 6.2(x) or a later release, or upgrade via a traditional reload. For additional details, see CSCud63092.

 FEX Host Interface

 When you upgrade Cisco NX-OS software by changing boot variables and reloading the device, make sure to save the FEX HIF configuration to the startup configuration, as well as another location (such as bootflash or an external server). Once the upgrade to a new release is complete, and the FEX is fully online and associated, reapply the FEX HIF configuration.




Note During the process of Cisco Fabric Extender (FEX) modules getting connected to a Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switch, if the switch is manually upgraded or downgraded, FEX host interfaces (HIFs) lose the configuration. To avoid it, if you are manually upgrading the vPC system, you must save the FEX HIF (FEX host interfaces connected to hosts) configurations to both the startup configuration file and to an external device before starting the reload, and reapply the configuration once the FEX module is fully online.





 FEX Queuing

 The FEX queuing feature is enabled by default if you perform an ISSU to a release that supports this feature from an earlier release that supports this feature. The feature is not enabled if you perform an ISSU to a release that supports this feature from an earlier release that does not support this feature.
 For an ISSU to Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2a) from Release 6.1(x), you must reload the FEX to enable FEX queuing after the ISSU. Enter the  show queuing interface  fex-hif-port command to verify if FEX queuing is enabled on a given FEX. 

 VACL Configuration Should Be Removed Before ISSU

 If an active or inactive VACL configuration is present in the running configuration, an ISSU from any release earlier than Cisco NX-OS Release 6.1(3) to Release 6.2(2a) will not succeed.
 Enter the  show running-config aclmgr inactive-if-config command to check for inactive policies. You can remove these policies by entering the  clear inactive config acl/qos command.
 To work around this issue, remove all VACLs from the system before the ISSU, or perform a two-step upgrade to Release 6.1(3) and then to Release 6.2(2a).

 The MAC Packet Classify Configuration Should Be Removed Before ISSU

 If the  mac packet-classify command is configured for any interface, the ACLMGR process might fail during an ISSU to Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2a).
 To work around this issue, remove all  mac packet-classify commands from the configuration for all interfaces before the ISSU.

 OTV

 Any upgrade from an image that is earlier than Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2) to an image that is Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2) or later in an OTV network is disruptive. When you upgrade from any previous release, the OTV overlay needs to be shut down for ISSU to operate.
 For more details, see the  “Preparing OTV for ISSU to Cisco NX-OS 5.2(1) or Later Releases in a Dual-Homed Site” section in the  Cisco Nexus 7000 Series NX-OS OTV Configuration Guide.

 LISP

 If you have LISP configured on a Cisco Nexus 7000 Series device, you must remove the configuration before an ISSU. 

 OSPF

 Cisco NX-OS Release 6.1 supports an increased number of Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) process instances per VDC. See the  Cisco Nexus 7000 Series NX-OS Verified Scalability Guide for the latest verified number. 
 If you have more than four OSPF v2 or more than four OSPF v3 process instances configured and you manually downgrade to an earlier release, you must remove instances 5 and higher. Use the following command to match an OSPF v2 process tag with an OSPF process instance:

switch# show system internal sysmgr service name ospf


Service "__inst_005__ospf" ("ospf", 13): <= OSPF process instance


 UUID = 0x41000119, PID = 3402, SAP = 320


 State: SRV_STATE_HANDSHAKED (entered at time Mon Jul 23 05:11:33 2012).


 Restart count: 1


 Time of last restart: Mon Jul 23 05:11:33 2012.


 The service never crashed since the last reboot.


  Tag = 1 <= configured process tag


 Plugin ID: 1


 

 Use the  show system internal sysmgr service name ospfv3 command to match an OSPF v3 process tag with an OSPF v3 process instance.
 This enhancement was added for EIGRP and ISIS with Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2.

 ACL

 During an ISSU from Cisco NX-OS Release 5.2(x) or Release 6.1(x) to Release 6.2(2a), the system prompts you to clear inactive access control list (ACL) configurations. Enter the  clear inactive-config acl command to clear any inactive ACL configurations.

 CoPP

 The default Control Plane Policing (CoPP) policy does not change when you upgrade the Cisco NX-OS software.
 If you manually downgrade without using ISSD to a release earlier than NX-OS Release 5.2(1), the CoPP configuration is lost, and a CoPP policy is no longer attached to the control plane.

 Aggressive Failure Detection Timers

 ISSU, stateful switchover (SSO), and graceful restart are not supported when aggressive failure detection timers are used for any Layer 3 protocols. Starting in Cisco NX-OS Release 5.2(3a), the First Hop Redundancy Protocol (FHRP) with aggressive timers has been validated for SSO or ISSU using the extended hold timer feature. Other protocols such as OSPF have been validated with aggressive timers without SSO or ISSU support. For additional information on aggressive timer support and extended hold timers for FHRP, see the  Cisco Nexus 7000 Series NX-OS Unicast Routing Configuration Guide.

 IPFIB Errors

 During an upgrade to Cisco NX-OS Release 5.2(7) or a later release, the following error messages might appear:

%IPFIB-SLOT2-2-FIB_TCAM_HA_ERROR: FIB recovery errors, please capture 'show 


tech forwarding l3 unicast' and 'show tech forwarding l3 multicast'


 

 In addition, the ipfib process might fail.
 This issue can be triggered when the following sequence of events occur:
 – You perform an ISSU to Cisco NX-OS Release 5.2(1), Release 5.2(3a), Release 5.2(4), or Release 5.2(5) release from an earlier 5.0(x) or 5.1(x) release and you have not reloaded the switch.
 – You make configuration changes in the 5.2(x) release running on the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series system.
 – You perform an ISSU to NX-OS Release 5.2(7) or a later release. 
 To work around this issue, follow these steps:
  1. Prior to the upgrade, enter the following commands to avoid the issue:
  a. Enter the  feature lisp command.
  b. Enter the  ip lisp etr command for all virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) instances, followed by the  no ip lisp etr  command.
  c. Enter the  no feature lisp command.
  2. If you experience this issue, reload the affected modules on your Cisco Nexus 7000 Series system.




Note The Transport Services Package license is required to enable the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP). If you do not have this license, you can enable the grace period for it. If you cannot enable the grace period, perform an ISSU and reload the affected modules.




 Perform these steps even if you are not using LISP because the issue can occur even if LISP is not running.

 BGP 

 If both  send-community and  send-community extended are in the configuration for Cisco NX-OS 6.1 or an earlier release and an ISSU is performed, only  send-community extended will be present in the configuration for a Cisco NX-OS 6.2 or later release after the ISSU. You will have to manually reconfigure  send-community. The running configuration will show  send-community both  instead of both commands.



CMP Images
 Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2a) does not include a new connectivity management processor (CMP) image.
 Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2) includes a new CMP image for the Cisco Nexus 7000 Supervisor 1 module. The CMP is upgraded to Release 6.2(2) on a successful ISSU to Cisco NX-OS to Release 6.2(2). When the ISSU completes, reload the CMP image on the active and standby Supervisor 1 modules.
 Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2) does not include a CMP image for the Cisco Nexus 7000 Supervisor 2 or Supervisor 2 Enhanced module because neither module has a CMP.
 Cisco Nexus 7700 Series switches do not have a CMP.
 For additional information about the CMP, see the  Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Connectivity Management Processor Configuration Guide.  


EPLD Images
 Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(8) includes new EPLD images for the M1 Series I/O modules with XL and M2 forwarding engines, the Network Analysis Module (NAM) Azuma FPGA, and the N77-F248XP-23E I/O module power manager and IO devices. For more information about upgrading to a new EPLD image, see the  Cisco Nexus 7000 Series FPGA/EPLD Upgrade Release Notes, Release 6.2. 
 Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2a) does not include new EPLD images.
 Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2) includes a new EPLD image for the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Supervisor 1 and the Supervisor 2 module. 
 Cisco Nexus 7700 Series switches have an EPLD image that is programmed on the switches. This EPLD image is different than the EPLD image for the Cisco Nexus 7000 switches. 
 The Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Network Analysis Module (Cisco NAM-NX1) also includes an EPLD image that is programmed on the device.

Changed Software Features
 This section describes software features that are changed in Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2. 
 This section includes the following topics:

 VDC Changes in Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2
 Features Available on F2, F2e, and F3 Series Modules


VDC Changes in Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2
 Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2) provides several changes to VDCs that apply to Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switches and Cisco Nexus 7700 Series switches.

 For a chassis with only F2e Series modules, the default VDC will be created using an F2e Series module as a supported module, unless you apply your own configuration. 
 In Release 6.2(2), F2 Series modules can only be a part of an F2 VDC or an F2-F2E VDC. 
 The F2e and F2 Series modules cannot exist with the F1 Series module in a VDC.
 A new VDC type, F2E, supports only F2e Series modules, but can be added to other VDC types to allow F2E to be part of the same VDC with F2 modules, or M1 or M2 Series modules. An F2e Series module and any M Series module can be configured in the same VDC.
 During an upgrade to Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2), if you have F2 and F2e Series modules, the VDC type automatically changes to the F2-F2E VDC.
 In an F2-F2E VDC, only the features supported on the F2 Series module are supported.

 Review the “Upgrade or Downgrade Caveats” section for information related to VDCs that you should be aware of before upgrading to Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2).
 For additional information, see the  Cisco Nexus 7000 Series NX-OS VDC Configuration Guide.

 MPLS
 FabricPath
 VDC
 vPC and vPC+
 OTV
 Routing Capabilities
 Security Features
 SPAN
 LISP
 IPSLA
 FEX
 ISIS MT
 Confirm Commit Device Alias



MPLS 
 New MPLS features in Release 6.2(2) include the following:

 Any Transport over MPLS (AToM), which accommodates different types of Layer 2 packets, including Ethernet and VLAN, to enable the service provider to transport different types of traffic over the backbone.
 Pseudowire provisioning for AToM, which enables you to configure static pseudowires in cases where you cannot use directed control protocols, such as the Label Distribution Protocol or Resource Reservation Protocol over traffic-engineered tunnels (RSVP-TE). 
 Ethernet over Multiprotocol Label Switching (EoMPLS), which is a Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) that is used to carry Layer 2 Ethernet frames over an MPLS network. EoMPLS enables service providers to offer emulated Ethernet services over existing MPLS networks. 
 EoMPLS Graceful Restart, which adds support for a switch that is configured with the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) Graceful Restart (GR) to assist its neighboring switches to recover gracefully from an interruption in service.
 Layer 2 and Layer 3 load balancing coexistence, which supports Layer 3 VPN and Layer 2 VPN forwarding that is performed independently on the switch using two different types of adjacencies. The forwarding is not impacted by having a different method of load balancing for the Layer 2 VPN.
 Virtual Private LAN Service, which supports a point-to-multipoint service between multiple customer sites using a mesh of point-to-point pseudowires over the provider core to emulate a LAN between the sites.
 Inter-AS Option B lite is supported.



FabricPath
 FabricPath has been enhanced to include the following:

 Anycast Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP)
 An overload bit
 Support for multiple topologies (ISIS-MT)
 Layer 2 proxy learning
 Scale improvements



VDC
 New VDC features in Release 6.2(2) are as follows:

 A new VDC type, F2e
 An Administrator VDC on the Supervisor 1 module
 Support for an F2e Series module and an M Series module in the same VDC



vPC and vPC+
 Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2) includes the following new vPC and vPC+ features:

 A best practice macro for vPCs can be enabled in vPC domain configuration mode with the  mode auto command. This feature enables the following vPC best practice features:

 – peer gateway
 – auto recovery
 – ip arp synchronize
 – ipv6 nd synchronize

 Release 6.2(2) supports Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) in a vPC+ domain.



OTV
 The following Overlay Transport Virtualization (OTV) features are available in Release 6.2(2):

 The VLAN translation feature allows you to connect applications that reside in separate Layer 2 domains between data centers. 
 Selective unknown Unicast flooding is a per MAC address configuration that allows OTV to flood across the DCI for the specified MAC address. This feature is particularly helpful for applications that go silent and timeout from the ARP tables.
 Dedicated broadcast group allows you to configure a separate multicast address for broadcast traffic. This feature is useful for organizations that need separate QoS policies for broadcast traffic.
 OTV has built-in BFD support that does not require any additional configuration on the OTV side, which helps with any reconvergence that OTV might have to handle.
 The scale of OTV and how fast it converges are improved in this release.
 F1 Series and F2e Series modules can be used as internal interfaces with the OTV VDC.



Routing Capabilities
 Release 6.2(2) provides improved routing capabilities through these features:

 The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) relay now supports IPv6.
 Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) has been enhanced to include a client for ISISv6, PIMv6, BGPv6, and OSPFv3.
 IPv6 logo phase 2 certification is available in this release.
 The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) has been enhanced to include flexible distance manipulation and an injection map.
 Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) v3 is supported.
 VRF scale enhancements are in this release.
 Private VLAN (PVLAN) support is provided for vPCs and port channels.
 Layer 2 scale improvements are a part of this release.



Security Features
 Release 6.2(2) includes enhancements for numerous security features, including these:

 ACL ternary content address memory (TCAM) bank mapping allows TCAM banks to accommodate more feature combinations in a more predictable manner. By using this feature, you can optimize space and maximize the utilization of TCAM banks.
 Added support for the DHCPv6 relay agent. You can configure a device to run a DHCPv6 relay agent, which forwards DHCPv6 packets between clients and servers. This feature is useful when clients and servers are not on the same physical subnet. 
 For Control Plane Policing (CoPP)

 – Changed the behavior of multicast traffic from being policed at different rates in different classes to being grouped into three classes (multicast-host, multicast-router, and normal) and policed at consistent rates.
 – Added the ability to monitor CoPP with SNMP using the CISCO-CLASS-BASED-QOS-MIB.


SPAN
 SPAN enhancements include the following:

 (2+6) bidirectional or 2 bidirectional and 12 unidirectional SPAN sessions for F1, F2, F2e, and M2 Series I/O modules.
 A rule-based SPAN filter.
 An F2 Series module or an F2e Series module provides Encapsulated Remote Switched Port Analyzer (ERSPAN) termination.



LISP
 LISP includes these new features:

 The LISP Instance ID supports virtualization and provides a means of maintaining unique address spaces (or address space segmentation) in the control and data plane. 
 The LISP Delegated Database Tree (DDT) defines a large-scale distributed database of LISP Endpoint Identifier (EID) space using a DDT node.
 Support for multicast.



IPSLA
 IP service level agreement (IPSLA) features enhancements include PBR object tracking, ICMP, ECHO, and DNS.

ISIS MT
 This release introduces support RFC 5120 - M-ISIS, Multi-Topology (MT) Routing in NXOS IS-IS. Multitopology (MT) ISIS allows you to define a set of independent topologies for different protocols within a single IS-IS domain. Cisco NX-OS supports one topology for IPv4 and one topology for IPv6.


Confirm Commit Device Alias
 The confirm commit feature is enabled by default. In the previous version of code prior to 6.2(10), the dialogue information is not shown, but in the later versions, it’s shown by default. 


Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2a) Software Features
 Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2a) includes the new features described in the following sections:

 RISE
 BFD for IPv6 Static Routes
 Static Route to a VLAN
 USGv6 and IPv6 Phase 2 Ready Logo
 FIPS
 Dynamic Fabric Automation (DFA)



RISE
 The Remote Integration Service Engine (RISE) architecture logically integrates the Citrix NetScaler appliance and the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switch so that the Citrix NetScaler service appliance appears as a service module within the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switch. RISE provides streamlined deployment, simplified configuration, and reduced operational costs for service appliances. RISE enables service integration with the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switch virtual device context (VDC) architecture.


BFD for IPv6 Static Routes
 In Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2a), you can configure BFD for all IPv6 static routes on an interface.


Static Route to a VLAN
 A switch virtual interface (SVI) includes a static route to a VLAN in Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2a).


USGv6 and IPv6 Phase 2 Ready Logo
 Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2a) includes features for USGv6 and IPv6 Phase 2 Ready Logo.


FIPS
 Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2a) includes features that qualify this release for Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2 Level 1 certification for the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series. The release is planned to be submitted for certification in December 2013.


Dynamic Fabric Automation (DFA)
 Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(6a) is the first release to support the Cisco data center fabric solution called Dynamic Fabric Automation (DFA). DFA is evolutionary and is based on the industry leading Unified Fabric solution.
 DFA focuses on simplifying, optimizing and automating data center fabric environments by offering an architecture based on four major pillars namely fabric management, workload automation, optimized networking and virtual fabrics. Each of these pillars provide a set of modular functions which can be used together or independently for easiness of adoption of new technologies in the data center environment.
 For the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series devices, the F2, F2e, and F3 Series modules support this functionality. On the Cisco Nexus 7700 Series devices, the F2e and F3 Series modules are support this functionality.
 Complete details on the DFA architecture can be found at  http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/data-center-virtualization/unified-fabric/dynamic_fabric_automation.html. 


Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(6) Software Features
 Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(6) includes the new features described in the following sections:

 MVRP
 MAC Security
 VLAN Translation
 OTV Support
 OTV Traffic Depolarization
 Interoperability Between Modules
 FCoE Over Physical Port vPC
 Physical Port vPC
 Ingress NetFlow Sampling and DHCP Relay Together
 F3 Series and F2 Series Modules with Dynamic Fabric Automation
 Automatic Bandwidth Adjustment for MPLS TE Tunnels
 ACL Logged as a Permit or Deny Entry
 Large SGT,DGT Pairs
 ELAM Enhancement



MVRP
 The Multiple VLAN Registration Protocol (MVRP) is a VLAN membership protocol, in which end stations and bridges can issue or withdraw declarations related to the membership of VLANs. The attribute type is the 12-bit VLAN ID. MVRP is a pruning protocol that forbids the propagation of unknown broadcast and unknown multicast frames in the regions of the network that do not need to receive those frames. 
 Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(6) provides support for this feature.


MAC Security
 The MAC Security (MACSec) feature is used for encryption and decryption, 
 MACSec support is available on F2e Series modules in Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(6), with the following caveats:

 F2 Series modules with copper interfaces—All ports support MACSec (N7K-F248XT-25E and N77-F248XT-25E).
 F2 Series modules with fiber interfaces—The last eight ports (41 to 48) support MACSec (N7K-F248XP-25E and N77-F248XP-25E).



VLAN Translation
 VLAN translation provides flexibility in managing VLANs and data center-related services by allowing you to merge the two Layer 2 domains without actually changing the original VLAN number. For example, when two data centers are connected using some form of DCI such as OTV and reconfiguration is not worth the collateral damage it can cause. 
 Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(6) provides support for VLAN translation. Per-port VLAN translation is supported on all hardware and software protocols.


OTV Support
 Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(6) provides support for Overlay Transport Virtualization (OTV) on the F3 Series modules. This feature is supported only in VDCs without OTV extended switched virtual interfaces (SVIs). VLAN translation and traffic depolarization are not supported.


OTV Traffic Depolarization
 OTV traffic depolarization is enabled by default with Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(6). Also, the OTV display shows the secondary addresses used by the overlay and adjacencies. You can disable route depolarization using the command-line interface (CLI). This is enabled for all modules except the F3 Series modules.


Interoperability Between Modules
 With Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(6), you can interoperate the F3 Series modules with other types of modules in the same VDC, in a lowest common denominator mode. The following combinations of modules are allowed:

 F3 Series modules with F2 Series and/or F2e Series modules
 F3 Series modules with M2 Series modules

 In both cases, all modules perform full Layer 2 and Layer 3 forwarding based on their native capabilities (there is no proxy routing with F3 modules as on earlier M Series and F Series mixed VDCs). Therefore, only features that are common to all of the modules in the VDC are supported, and available hardware forwarding table sizes are generally equivalent to the smallest forwarding table sizes of any of the modules.
 With Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(6), you cannot interoperate the F3 Series plus the F2 and/or F2e Series plus the M2 Series modules in the same VDC.


FCoE Over Physical Port vPC
 The Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(6) supports Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) with the physical port virtual port channel (vPC) for the F2 Series and F2e Series modules. This feature is not supported on the F3 Series modules.


Physical Port vPC
 The Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(6) supports the physical port virtual port channel (vPC) for the F2 Series and F2e Series modules. This feature is not supported on the F3 Series modules.


Ingress NetFlow Sampling and DHCP Relay Together
 With the Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(6), you can configure ingress NetFlow sampling and DHCP relay on the same interface.


F3 Series and F2 Series Modules with Dynamic Fabric Automation
 Both the F3 Series and the F2 Series modules can function with Dynamic Fabric Automation (DFA).


Automatic Bandwidth Adjustment for MPLS TE Tunnels
 The automatic bandwidth adjustment for TE tunnels feature allows you to configure Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) to automatically monitor and adjust the bandwidth allocation for TE tunnels based on their measured traffic load. The automatic bandwidth behavior changes the configured bandwidth in the running configuration. If automatic bandwidth is configured for a tunnel, TE automatically adjusts the tunnel’s bandwidth. This feature is supported with Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(6).


ACL Logged as a Permit or Deny Entry
 The switch indicates if the logged ACL was a permit or deny entry with Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(6).


Large SGT,DGT Pairs
 The switch now supports downloading large SGT,DGT tables, with improved caching functionality.


ELAM Enhancement
 With Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(6), you do not have to specify the module to run Embedded Logic Analyzer Module (ELAM).


Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(8) Software Features
 Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(8) includes the new features described in the following sections:

 Display of I/O Rates
 IPv4 Prefix over IPv6 in BGP
 BGP Next Hop
 BGP PIC Edge Active-Backup
 BGP Prefix-Peer Wait Timer
 Intelligent Traffic Director
 LISP
 OSPF Distribute List Enhancement
 RISE Phase 2
 RISE with NAM
 RISE with FEX
 Python Enhancements
 GOLD Corrective Action
 OTV Tunnel Depolarization
 Support for Increased Number of Policers
 NAM Data Center Protocol Performance Improvements in FPGA 6.2
 FabricPath Anycast



Display of I/O Rates
 A new show command has been added to display only input/output rates for the interfaces:
  show interface  ex/y  counter brief load-interval  load 


IPv4 Prefix over IPv6 in BGP
 Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(8), BGP supports RFC 5549 which allows an IPv4 prefix to be carried over an IPv6 next hop. Because BGP is running on every hop and all routers are capable of forwarding IPv4 and IPv6 traffic, there is no need to support IPv6 tunnels between any routers. BGP installs IPv4 over an IPv6 route to the Unicast Route Information Base (URIB).


BGP Next Hop 
 By default, BGP puts itself as the next hop when announcing to an eBGP peer. When you enter the  set ip next-hop unchanged command for an outbound route map that is configured for an eBGP peer, it propagates the received next hop to the eBGP peer.


BGP PIC Edge Active-Backup
 Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(8) introduces the  additional paths install backup command which enables BGP to install the backup path to the routing table when you are using the BGP Prefix Independent Convergence (PIC) Edge feature.


BGP Prefix-Peer Wait Timer
 Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(8) introduces the  timers prefix-peer-wait command that enables you to disable the peer prefix wait time so that there is no delay before BGP prefixes are inserted into the RIB.


Intelligent Traffic Director
 Intelligent Traffic Director (ITD) is an intelligent, scalable clustering, and load-balancing engine that addresses the performance gap between a multiterabit switch and gigabit servers and appliances. The ITD architecture integrates Layer 2 and Layer 3 switching with Layer 4 to Layer 7 applications for scale and capacity expansion to serve high-bandwidth applications. ITD provides adaptive load balancing to distribute traffic to an application cluster. With this feature on the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switch, you can deploy servers and appliances from any vendor without a network or topology upgrade.


LISP
 Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(8) introduces the LISP multi-hop mobility functionality. 
 LISP multi-hop mobility provides a mechanism to separate LISP host detection from Tunnel Router function, previously implemented in the same device: the Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR) and Egress Tunnel Router (ETR), also known as xTR. A LISP First-Hop Router (FHR) detects the presence of a dynamic host Endpoint Identifier (EID) and notifies the Site Gateway xTR, which registers the dynamic EID with a Map Server. The Site Gateway xTR performs Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) encapsulation/decapsulation of the traffic from or to the dynamic EID to or from remote sites.
 LISP supports redistributing host routes for servers discovered by LISP into Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) via Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol, Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol, Routing Information Protocol (RIP), Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), and Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP). LISP supports server detection based on receiving host routes updates on a Site Gateway xTR, using the same routing protocols listed above.
 Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(8), the ITR supports load balancing based on map-cache weights for encapsulated packets, as specified in RFC6830. For example, if there are four locators in a map-cache entry, with the weights assigned as 30, 20, 20, and 10, the first locator destination gets 37.5 percent of the traffic, the second and third locators get 25 percent of the traffic, and the fourth locator gets 12.5 percent of the traffic. 


OSPF Distribute List Enhancement
 This enhancement allows you to filter next-hop paths for a given OSPF route from being programmed into the RIB using the  route-map   map-tag [ deny |  permit ] command. 


RISE Phase 2
 The Remote Integrated Service Engine (RISE) makes a service appliance appear as a service module to the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switches so that an appliance user can enjoy the same benefit of a service module’s simple configuration and operation. The RISE phase 2 feature set adds support for auto policy-based routing (APBR), including appliance high availability (HA) and vPC support. 


RISE with NAM
 This feature enables a direct connection between a NAM appliance and the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switches, including the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switches and Cisco Nexus 7700 Series switches, through the Remote Integrated Service Engine (RISE) mechanism.


RISE with FEX
 Cisco NX-OS 6.2(8) has tested the Cisco Remote Integrated Services Engine (RISE) on the following Fabric Extenders, and the remaining FEX models are expected to work:

 Cisco Nexus 2248PQ-10GE Fabric Extender
 Cisco Nexus2248TP-1GE Fabric Extender



Python Enhancements
 Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(8), you can change the Python socket operation to another VRF instance. It does not have to stay in the management VRF.
 Additional enhancements to Python are as follows:

 You can use the import  hashlib statement,
 You can import the logging module.
 Cisco now supports the Java Script Object Notation (JSON) module.



GOLD Corrective Action
 You can configure the system to take disruptive action if the system detects a failure on specified health-monitoring online diagnostic tests.


OTV Tunnel Depolarization
 Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(8), support is added for the OTV traffic depolarization feature on F3 Series modules. OTV traffic depolarization is enabled by default. The OTV display shows the secondary addresses used by the overlay and adjacencies. You can disable traffic depolarization using the  otv depolarization disable command. See the  Cisco Nexus 7000 Series NX-OS OTV Configuration Guide for more information.


Support for Increased Number of Policers
 Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(8), you can have up to 4.096 class-maps per policy.


NAM Data Center Protocol Performance Improvements in FPGA 6.2
 To take advantage of the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series NX-OS Release 6.2(8) performance improvements for Data Center protocols (VxLAN, FabricPath, OTV, LISP, Segment ID, VNTag, and FCoE), you can upgrade the FPGA image in your Cisco Nexus 7000 Series NAM-NX1. For details on how to upgrade your FPGA image, see the  FPGA/EPLD Upgrade Note for Cisco Prime NAM-NX1, 6.0.


FabricPath Anycast
 Prior to The Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(8), The FabricPath Layer 2 IS-IS was advertising the anycast switch ID even with the overload bit set, which would incur longer convergence times for selected nodes. Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(8), the system does not advertise the configured anycast switch ID while the overload bit is set, which effectively improves the convergence times.


Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(10) Software Features
 Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(10) includes the new features described in the following sections:

 LISP
 Enhancement for ACL TCAM Bank Mapping
 QoS Shared Buffering Queuing on F3 Series Modules
 GRE Tunnels on F3 Series Modules
 BPDU Guard for Pruned VLANs
 Enhancement to Online Diagnostics
 Control Plane Policing
 Native VLAN Tagging on Trunk Ports
 Remove FabricPath Headers from SPAN Packets
 SGT Support for F3 Series Modules
 Common Criteria
 Intelligent Traffic Director
 License Requirement MP-BGP RR for FabricPath (aka DFA)



LISP
 The ITR now supports dynamic Path MTU discovery for data packets received from local servers. It sets the Don’t Fragment (DF) bit value in LISP outer header and can adjust the MTU value used for encapsulation based on the particular Routing Locator (RLOC) destination capability.


Enhancement for ACL TCAM Bank Mapping
 The  show hardware acces-list feature-combo command is added to display the mix of classification features that customers plan to use and if they will work together. See the  Cisco Nexus 7000 Series NX-OS Security Command Reference  for more information.


QoS Shared Buffering Queuing on F3 Series Modules
 You can split QoS buffers into dedicated and shared buffers. With only dedicated buffers based on the CoS value, one queue may have very high traffic even though memory associated with some of the other queues may be lying idle. The shared buffer pools address this problem. 
 The default is disabled for shared buffer queuing and it runs per port.


GRE Tunnels on F3 Series Modules
 Support is added for GRE tunnels on F3 Series Modules.


BPDU Guard for Pruned VLANs
 BPDUs are dropped if they are not in the allowed VLAN list and if BPDU Guard is enabled on the port. In Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(10) and later releases, the port will be error disabled when an a BPDU is received on any VLAN and BPDU Guard is enabled on the port.


Enhancement to Online Diagnostics
 A new nondisruptive health monitoring test per module, the Internal PortLoopback test, is added. This test verifies the integrity of packet paths from the supervisor to all front ports and runs while the ports are UP.


Control Plane Policing
 You can classify and rate-limit IP unicast RPF failure packets by using the  match exception ip unicast rpf-failure command. See the  Cisco Nexus 7000 Series NX-OS Security Command Reference  for more information.


Native VLAN Tagging on Trunk Ports
 Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(10), you can specify whether control and data packets are tagged or untagged by using the  vlan dot1q tag native command at the global configuration level, or the  switch port trunk native vlan tag command at the port level. See the  Cisco Nexus 7000 Series NX-OS Interfaces Command Reference  for more information.


Remove FabricPath Headers from SPAN Packets
 This release added new commands to remove the FabricPath header on traffic going to SPAN destinations. 


SGT Support for F3 Series Modules
 Support is added for security group tags (SGT) on F3 Series modules.


Common Criteria
 Support is added for Common Criteria in this release.


Intelligent Traffic Director
 Intelligent Traffic Director (ITD) has the following enhancements in Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(10):

 Weighted load-balancing.
 Node-level standby. 
 Layer 4 port load-balancing.
 Sandwich mode node-state synchronization across two VDCs on the same Cisco Nexus 7000 Series device.
 DNS probe.
 Start/stop/clear ITD statistics collection.
 The  show itd statistics command output shows percentage of traffic. 
 VRF support for the ITD service and probes.
 Scalability changes:

 – 32 ITD services per VDC.
 – 16 virtual IPs per ITD service.


License Requirement MP-BGP RR for FabricPath (aka DFA)
 The MPLS license and MPLS feature set requirement for the Spine node with MP-BGP Route Reflector has been removed with Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(10). You can configure  feature fabricpath-vpn instead of feature-set MPLS and  feature mpls l3vpn to enable the VPNv4/VPNv6 address families on the MP-BGP Route Reflector.


Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(12) Software Features
 Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(12) includes the new features described in the following sections:

 Cisco Nexus 7706 FCoE Support

Usage of System POAP Commands in Supervisor Modules
 In Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(22) when you use either  system no poap or  system poap command in an active supervisor module, make sure the respective command is applied on the standby supervisor console also.


Native VLAN Change Causes Link Flap
 Changing the native VLAN on an access port or trunk port will flap the interface. This behavior is expected.


VLAN Translation on Fabric Extender Is Not Supported
 VLAN translation on fabric extender is not supported. If you need to map a VLAN, you must move the interface to the parent switch and then configure the VLAN translation on the switches directly. The VLAN translation configuration is applicable for trunk ports connecting two data centers.


MPLS over GRE
 MPLS over GRE is not supported on F3 and M3 modules.


MAC Address Is Not Learned Over Peer Link
 When port security is configured on an orphan port that belongs to a VPC VLAN, the MAC address does not sync up with the peer and this leads to flooding on the peer link.This behavior is expected. To overcome this issue do not use VPC VLAN port for port security configuration.


The no hardware ejector enable Command Is Not Recommended for Long-Term Use
 The  no hardware ejector enable  command cannot be a configured command in both the startup configuration and the runtime configuration. This command is a debugging command and should not be configured for long-term use. 
 In Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(6), if you have dual Sup2e supervisors and your configuration includes the  no hardware ejector enable  command, physically removing the active supervisor will cause the modules to reload.
 To work around this limitation, do not physically remove an active supervisor. Instead, use the  system switchover  command to switch to the standby supervisor.
 This applies only to the Cisco Nexus 7700 Series devices.


Saving VLAN Configuration Information
 Because a VLAN configuration can be learned from the network while the VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) is in a server/client mode, the VLAN configuration is not stored in the running configuration. If you copy the running configuration to a file and apply this configuration at a later point, including after a switch reload, the VLANs will not be restored. However, the VLAN configuration will be erased if the switch is the only server in the VTP domain.
 To work around this limitation, do one of the following:

 Configure one of the clients as the server.
 Complete these steps:

 – Copy the VTP data file to the bootflash: data file by entering the  copy  vtp-datafile  bootflash:  vtp-datafile  command. 
 – Copy the ASCII configuration to the startup configuration by entering the  copy  ascii-cfg-file  startup-config command.
 – Reload the switch with Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2) or a later release.
 This limitation does not apply to a binary configuration, which is the recommended approach, but only to an ASCII configuration. In addition, this limitation applies to all Cisco NX-OS software releases for the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series.


Rebind Interfaces Command Is Not Automatically Executed When Replaying ASCII Configuration in Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(x) 
 The  rebind interfaces command introduced in Release 6.2(2), is needed to ensure the proper functionality of interfaces in certain circumstances. The command might be required when you change the module type of a VDC. However, because of the disruptive nature of the  rebind interfaces command, for Releases 6.2(x) prior to Release 6.2(8), it is not automatically executed when replaying an ASCII configuration file. Beginning with Release 6.2(8), the  rebind interfaces  command is always automatically performed whenever necessary during the replay of an ASCII configuration file.
 For those Releases 6.2(x) prior to Release 6.2(8), this limitation applies when only when all of the following conditions are met:

 The ASCII configuration file is replayed in the context of the default VDC or the admin VDC, and at least one VDC has an F2e Series or an F3 Series module listed as supported module types either before or after the replay.
 The  limit-resource module-type commands listed in the ASCII configuration file requires that  rebind interfaces command be performed.

 To work around this limitation, take the following steps:

 Manually enter the  rebind interfaces command wherever needed to the ASCII configuration file for replay.
 Enter the  rebind interfaces command immediately after the you enter the l imit-resource module-type command.
 Ensure that the ASCII replay properly applies all interface configurations for all interfaces in the relevant VDCs.





Note If you boot up a switch without any startup configuration, this limitation might apply to an ASCII replay. The reason is that without a startup configuration, the default VDC might still have certain interfaces automatically allocated. Because of this possibility, follow the preceding approaches to work around the limitation.






Fabric Module Removal on the Cisco Nexus 7700 Series
 When a fabric module is power cycled or removed momentarily during an online insertion and removal (OIR) from slot 5 or 6 on a Cisco Nexus 7700 Series switch, packet drops can occur. 


Fabric Utilization on the Cisco Nexus 7700 Series 
 When traffic ingresses from a module on the Cisco Nexus 7700 Series switch at a rate much below the line rate, uniform fabric utilization does not occur across the fabric modules. This behavior is expected and reflects normal operation based on the fabric autospreading technology used in the Cisco Nexus 7700 Series switch.


MTU Changes Do Not Take Effect on FEX Queues
 Starting with Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2), when you change the interface MTU on a FEX fabric port, the configured MTU on the FEX HIF ports are not configured to the same value (similar to the earlier release versions).
 Starting with Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2), the configured MTU for the FEX ports is controlled by the network QoS policy. To change the MTU that is configured on the FEX ports, modify the network QoS policy to change when the fabric port MTU is also changed. 
 If you change the FEX fabric port MTU on a version prior to Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(x), and then upgrade via ISSU to Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(x) or a later version, you will not get any issues until either a FEX or switch is reloaded. It is recommended that post-upgrade, the FEX HIF MTU be changed via the network QoS policy as described above.


Clearing FEX Queuing Statistics Is Not Supported
 Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2) does not support clearing queuing statistics for FEX host interfaces. 


Multicast Traffic Is Forwarded to FEX Ports
 Multicast traffic that is sent to Optimized Multicast Flooding (OMF) Local Targeting Logic (LTL) is forwarded to FEX ports that are not part of the bridge domain (BD). This issue occurs when multicast traffic is sent to OMF LTL, which happens if an unknown unicast and flood occur when OMF is enabled.
 FEX interfaces can support multicast routers, but OMF on those VLANs must be disabled. If there is a multicast MAC address mismatch on the VLAN, traffic will be flooded in the VLAN and will eventually reach the router behind the FEX port.


F2 Connectivity Restrictions on Connecting Ports to a FEX
 If an ASCII configuration has incompatible ports, such as when the configuration is created with ports that are added to the FEX from different line cards or VDC type, the ports might be added without warnings.
 When connecting F2 Series ports to the same FEX, make sure the VDC type is the same as in the source configuration that is being replayed. 


ACL Capture on the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Network Analysis Module
 The Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Network Analysis Module (Cisco NAM-NX1) does not support ACL capture on a NAM interface in Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2).


Behavior of Control Plane Packets on an F2e Series Module
 To support the coexistence of an F2e Series module with an M Series module in the same VDC, the F2e Series module operates in a proxy mode so that all Layer 3 traffic is sent to an M Series module in the same VDC. For F2e proxy mode, having routing adjacencies connected through F2e interfaces with an M1 Series module is not supported. However, routing adjacencies connected through F2e interfaces with an M2 Series module is supported.


Error Appears When Copying a File to the Running Configuration
 Copying a file to the running configuration can trigger the following error:

"WARNING! there is unsaved configuration" message.


 

 This issue can occur if the configuration contains SNMP related configurations to send traps or notifications, and if the file to be copied to the running configuration contains only EXEC  show commands.
 Enter  Yes to the prompt “This command will reboot the system. (y/n)? [n] y.” There is no operational impact and no configuration loss when the switch reloads.


CISCO-TRUSTSEC-SXP-MIB Does Not Provide an Instance Number
 The object ctsxSxpConnInstance does not provide the instance number of the CTS SXP connection. Currently this number is not maintained and therefore cannot be displayed. 


Reload with CTS Configuration on the Nondefault VDC Causes a syslog Message
 When Cisco Trusted Security (CTS) enforcement is enabled on VLANs and a VDC reload occurs, CTS tries twice to disable the enforcement on the VLANs. The second time, the following syslog message appears:

CTS-2-RBACL_ENFORCEMENT_FAILED:Failed to disable RBACL enf on vdc reload


 

 This syslog message can be ignored for the VDC reload because the VLANs are deleted on reload and CTS also deletes the enforcement configurations for those VLANs.


CTS Configuration Command Not Available 
 The  no cts dev-id pswd dev-pswd command is currently not supported in NX-OS software.
 Once the  cts dev-id pass command is configured, it can be replaced using the same command, but it cannot be deleted.


ECMP Support in Hardware
 32-way ECMP is supported with F2 and F2e Series modules since Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2). It is supported for F3 Series modules since Release 6.2(6).


CLI Command for Breakout Capabilities
 Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2) supports the  show interface breakout command, and this command is visible on all modules even if the specific module does not support breakout capabilities. The following lists the software support requirements for the specific line cards that support breakout capabilities:

 N7K-M206FQ-23L module—Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2) is the minimum software requirement.
 N7K-F312FQ-25 module—Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(6) is the minimum software requirement.
 N77-F324FQ-25 module—Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(8) is the minimum software requirement.

 Please refer to Table 5 for the list of supported optics.


WCCP Support in a Mixed Mode VDC
 Web Cache Control Protocol (WCCP) redirect-in and redirect-out is fully supported in the Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2 in unmixed module VDCs. WCCP is also supported in mixed module VDC scenarios for most module combinations. For complete support details, see the    Cisco Nexus 7000 Series NX-OS Unicast Routing Configuration Guide, Release 6.x   for complete information.


DSCP Queuing with FEX and M1 Series Modules
 Differentiated services code point (DSCP) based queuing does not work for FEX uplinks to the 32-port 10-Gigabit Ethernet SFP+ I/O module (N7K-M132XP-12) or the 32-port 10-Gigabit Ethernet SFP+ I/O module XL (N7K-M132XP-12L). All FEX data traffic will be in the default queue. 
 This limitation applies only when a FEX is attached to ports on a N7K-M132XP-12 or N7K-M132XP-12L module. It does not affect COS based queuing. 


DHCP Snooping with vPC+ FEX
 DHCP snooping is not supported when the vPC+ FEX feature is enabled. 


Fabric Module Migration Errors
 When you remove a Fabric 1 module and replace it with a Fabric 2 module, errors might occur. On rare occasions, 1 to 10 packets can drop during the fabric module migration process. 
 To avoid this situation, enter the  out-of-service xbar command before you remove each Fabric 1 module. 
 Once the Fabric 1 module is out of service, remove it and insert the Fabric 2 module. 


Proxy Limitation for the N7K-F132XP-15 Module
 When the 6-port 40-Gigabit Ethernet I/O module XL (M2 Series) (N7K-M206FQ-23L) acts as a proxy for more than 90 G traffic from the 32-port 10-Gigabit Ethernet I/O module XL (N7K-F132XP-15), packet drops can occur. You might experience this issue if ports are oversubscribed on the N7K-F132XP-15 F1 Series module. 


PONG in a vPC Environment
 There are two situations where PONG is not supported in a vPC environment:
 – In a vPC environment, a PONG to an access switch or from an access switch might fail. To work around this issue, use the interface option while executing a PONG from an access switch to a vPC peer. The interface can be one that does not need to go over the peer link, such as an interface that is directly connected to the primary switch.
 – When FabricPath is enabled and there are two parallel links on an F2 Series module, PONG might fail. To work around this issue, form a port channel with the two links as members.


SVI Statistics on an F2 Series Module
 F2 Series I/O modules do not support per-VLAN statistics. Therefore, the  show interface command will not display per-VLAN Rx/Tx counters or statistics for switch virtual interfaces (SVIs).
 Inserting a new F2e module in a chassis running only M1 line cards will flap the SVIs on a chassis running 6.2(8a), 6.2(10), and 6.2(12). This is only seen the first time that an F2e module is inserted into M1 chassis. Issue does not reoccur if F2e module is removed and reinserted. SVI flap is by design and will occur when we insert the F2e module.


LISP Traffic
 A Layer 3 link is required between aggregation switches when deploying LISP host mobility on redundant LISP Tunnel Routers (xTRs) that are part of a vPC. In rare (but possible) scenarios, failure to deploy this Layer 3 link might result in traffic being moved to the CPU and potentially dropped by the CoPP rate limiters.


Role-Based Access Control

 Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 5.2, you can configure role-based access control (RBAC) in the Cisco Nexus 7000 storage VDC using Cisco NX-OS CLI commands. You cannot configure RBAC in the Cisco Nexus 7000 storage VDC using Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM). Note that RBAC in the storage VDC is RBAC for the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switches, which is different from that for the Cisco MDS 9500 Series switches.
 RBAC CLI scripts used in Cisco MDS 9500 Series switches cannot be applied to the storage VDC configured for a Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switch.
 You cannot distribute the RBAC configuration between a Cisco MDS 9500 Series switch and the storage VDC configured for a Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switch. To prevent this distribution, make sure to assign RBAC in Cisco MDS and the Cisco Nexus 7000 storage VDC to different Cisco Fabric Services (CFS) regions.



Standby Supervisor Can Reset with Feature-Set Operation
 The standby supervisor might reload when a feature-set operation (install, uninstall, enable, or disable) is performed if the HA state of the standby supervisor is not “HA standby” at the time of the feature-set operation. To prevent the reload, ensure that the state of the standby supervisor is “HA standby.” To check the HA state for the specific VDC where the feature-set operation is performed, enter the  show system redundancy ha status command on the active supervisor. 
 A reload of the standby supervisor has no operational impact because the active supervisor is not affected. 
 In addition, if you perform a feature-set operation while modules are in the process of coming up, then those modules are power cycled. Modules that are up and in the “OK” state are not power cycled when you perform a feature set operation.


Unfair Traffic Distribution for Flood Traffic
 Uneven load balancing of flood traffic occurs when you have a seven-member port channel. This behavior is expected and it occurs on all M Series and F Series modules. In addition, M Series modules do not support Result Bundle Hash (RBH) distribution for multicast traffic.


BFD Not Supported on the MTI Interface
 If bidirectional forwarding detection (BFD) on protocol independent multicast (PIM) is configured together with MPLS multicast VPN (MVPN), the following error might appear:
  2012 Jan 3 15:16:35 dc3_sw2-dc3_sw2-2 %PIM-3-BFD_REMOVE_FAIL: pim [22512] Session remove request for neighbor 11.0.3.1 on interface Ethernet2/17 failed (not enough memory) 
 This error is benign. To avoid the error, disable BFD on the multicast tunnel interface (MTI) interface.


DOM Support
 Diagnostic Optical Monitoring (DOM) is supported on the F3 Series modules in Cisco Nexus Release 6.2(8).


N77-F348XP-23: 1 Gigabit Ethernet Support
 On the Cisco Nexus 7700 48-port 1/10-Gigabit Ethernet SFP+ I/O module (N77-F348XP-23), 1 Gigabit Ethernet port speed is not supported on the F3 Series modules in Cisco Nexus Release 6.2(6). This is supported beginning in Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(8).


Level 4 Protocol Entries on the M Series Modules
 There is a limitation of using 7 entries for Level 4 protocols on the M Series modules.


F3 Series Module

 Two banks can be chained within the same TCAM. However, you cannot chain banks across multiple TCAMs.
 The bank chaining and bank mapping features cannot co-exist.
 You cannot configure port ACL features such as PACL, L2 QOS, and L2 NetFlow when you enable the VLAN-VLAN mode for configuring the flexible ACL TCAM bank chaining feature.
 The flexible ACL TCAM bank chaining feature is supported only on the F3 Series modules.
 Enabling the flexible ACL TCAM bank chaining feature on all the modules is not supported.



Storm-control Suppresses Unicast Traffic
 When you use the  storm-control unicast level percentage command in a module, both the unknown and known unicast traffic gets discarded after reaching the threshold value.


DFA Conversational Learning Route Aging in Bidirectional Traffic Scenario
 Conversational learning is used to scale more routes by deleting aged-out routes from hardware thereby providing space for new routes that are active in conversation.
 In the case of bidirectional traffic from a source to a destination route, the route will not age out unless both of the traffic streams are stopped. In the case where only one stream in a bidirectional stream is stopped, the route never ages out because ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) entries are used for both route lookup on the destination and the Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) check on the source. If you delete the entry based on one direction, RPF functionality configured on the reverse flow does not work. This is the reason our current ASICs marks a TCAM hit if a TCAM lookup happens in both directions (when an IP address lookup is done for the destination address and for the source address).

%RADIUS-3-RADIUS_ERROR_MESSAGE: Dropping response (packet ID 143) from server x.x.x.x


%RADIUS-3-RADIUS_ERROR_MESSAGE: RADIUS server x.x.x.x failed to respond


%RADIUS-3-RADIUS_ERROR_MESSAGE: RADIUS server x.x.x.x failed to respond evenafter all retries

  
  Conditions : This issue might be seen if AAA authentication and accounting are configured for Radius and your Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switch is running Release 6.0(2).
  Workaround : Removing the  aaa accounting default group command from the configuration to stop the traffic from being sent to the radius server.
 Also, adding the svc-isan user to the ACS server might resolve the issue.

 CSCue53247

  Symptom : There are invalid entries for the number of routers and the number of cache engines in the output of the  show ip wccp  command.
  Conditions : This issue might be seen in scale configurations, but it is not consistent. After a reload or loss of service, the issue might occur. 
  Workaround : Disable the feature and enable it again.

 CSCuf95718

  Symptom : High CPU utilization can occur on the active supervisor.
  Conditions : This symptom might be seen when Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) or EFP Ethernet virtual circuits are configured. The pktmgr process on the active supervisor registers high CPU utilization because it is busy dropping STP BPDUs that are entering the virtual circuit from the customer edge-side device.
  Workaround : Prevent STP BPDUs that originate from the customer-edge device from entering the provider-edge device where Ethernet virtual circuits/VPLS are configured.

 CSCuh94778

 Symptom: In a scale setup with a high number of logical ports, many processes compete for the CPU immediately after a system switchover. As a result, the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) has less CPU to be able to rebuild its own database and to send its time-critical BPDUs every 2 seconds. This situation causes a CBL port state change and traffic drop.
 Conditions: This symptom might be seen when a large number of logical ports are in either Rapid Spanning or Multiple Spanning tree configurations.
 Workaround: Make the scale lower on a single switch.

 CSCui07745

  Symptom : The following error message is displayed after an ISSU:

%NETSTACK-3-IPV6_MTS_DROP: netstack [9694] Error returned from mts_drop(), errno: Invalid argument


 

  Conditions : This symptom might be seen on a Cisco Nexus 7700 Series switch. 
  Workaround : None. There is no functional impact.

 CSCui25889

  Symptom : When the  peer-gateway exclude  vlans command is used to add or remove VLANs, the MAC address table G bit does not get updated.
  Conditions : This symptom might be seen if the number of configured SVIs is greater than 3660. 
  Workaround : To work around this issue, do one of the following:
 – Flap the peer link after the configuration changes. 
 – Before entering the command, shut down some SVIs to make the total number of SVIs less than 3660.

 CSCui28437

  Symptom : In a scale setup when debug logs are enabled, a few flush requests occur on particular port channels.
  Conditions : This symptom might be seen in a scale setup where the access layer contains a set of Catalyst 4000 switches.
  Workaround : Avoid any kind of debug logging during a stateful switchover.

 CSCui30896

  Symptom : In a scale setup with a high number of logical ports and with multiple VDCs, the number of processes competing for the CPU immediately after a switchover increases with a factor of the number of VDCs. This situation does not allow the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) enough of the CPU to send out its time-critical and sensitive bridge protocol data units (BPDUs).
  Conditions : This symptom might be seen when there are a large number of logical ports and multiple VDCs in either Rapid Spanning or Multiple Spanning Tree configurations.
  Workaround : Use multiple physical switches instead of VDCs for a large scale setup.

 CSCui33310

  Symptom : In a vPC setup, a peer-link flap will bring down the secondary vPCs. They come back up when the peer link is up. During the time the secondary vPCs are going down, if a switchover occurs and then the peer link comes up (in this corner case scenario), the secondary vPCs come up without active VLANs on them. A few vPCs might come up with active VLANs on them, or many or all vPCs might come up with no active VLANs on them.
  Conditions : This symptom might be seen on a Cisco Nexus 7000 Series device with a vPC setup and 4000 VLANs in use in the vPCs. The peer link goes down and before all the secondary vPCs go down, a switchover occurs.
  Workaround : When the secondary vPCs are up with no active VLANs on them, enter the  shut command followed by the  no shut command on those vPCs to recover all the active VLANs.

 CSCui49735

  Symptom : In a multi-VDC setup with a large number of VLANs, immediately after a stateful switchover there are many processes competing for the CPU. As a result, Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) has very little of the CPU to be able to rebuild its own database and send its time-critical BPDUs every 2 seconds and process the incoming BPDUs. This issue causes BPDU to time out and causes STP disputes for a short time.
  Conditions : This symptom might be seen when there are a large number of logical ports, particularly in Rapid Spanning Tree configurations.
  Workaround : Try to use Multiple Spanning Tree and if that does not work, lower the scale on a single switch.

 CSCui53933 

  Symptom : In a large scale vPC setup when a peer link port channel (with many member links) is shut on one peer or one of the peers is reloaded, the other peer experiences an Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) bridge protocol data unit (BPDU) timeout.
  Conditions : This issue might be seen when the  shut command is entered on the peer link (or it is brought down due to a peer reload) in a large scale vPC setup. In this situation, there were 4000 VLANs in the setup.
  Workaround : None.

 CSCui52204

  Symptom : The port numbers displayed from the show hardware internal statistics pktflow command output for the XBAR ASIC (SAC) are not correct because of different port mappings across the two SAC ASICs.
  Conditions : This symptom might be seen when you are working with an F3 Series module.
  Workaround : None.

 CSCui75788

  Symptom : When you are working with vPC+ on the F2 series modules, you might see stale MAC addresses in the MAC address table after you reload the module. The hardware MAC address tables will show that the RD value is 1.
  Conditions : This symptom might be seen when the VLAN is in FabricPath mode with traditional learning, and the aging time is low (typically lower than 10 minutes).
  Workaround : Clear the MAC address table for the problem addresses.

 CSCuj21989

  Symptom : The VLAN mapping configuration is not failing on a vPC peer link.
  Conditions : This symptom might be seen when you have configured a vPC.
  Workaround : You should not have VLAN translation configured before the link is configured as a peer link. After the link is configured as a peer link, do not configure VLAN translation on this link.

 CSCul56620

  Symptom : CDP does not work on the Layer 3 side when an F2 Series or M1 Series module is configured in the Layer 3 >> Layer 2 fashion.
  Conditions : This symptom might be seen when an F2 Series or M1 Series module is configured in the Layer 3 >> Layer 2 fashion.
  Workaround : Configure the Layer 2 side as access ports.

  Symptom : You might see a kernel-related syslog message while you are reloading the switch or performing ISSU to Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(6a).
  Conditions : You might see this symptom after  you perform a reload of the ISSU 
  Workaround : None.

 CSCuj20185

  Symptom : When you issue the clear ip ospf   id  neighbor command, you may see the ospf neighbor flap. 
  Conditions : In rare instances, you might see this when you have BFD enabled with OSPF.
  Workaround : None; but the system recovers.

 CSCum61174

 Symptom: When a sub-mode which is in use is deleted, it might lead to a VSH process crash.
  Conditions : This issue might be seen in the very rare occasion when one user configures a given sub mode and second user deletes that submode at the same time. This behavor is expected.
  Workaround : None.

 CSCun93531

  Symptom : The show policy-map interface brief command does not show the inherited policies from port-channel logical interface to the physical ports. 
  Conditions : You might see this symptom when custom queuing policies are applied on port channels.
  Workaround : Use the  show policy-map interface  x/y command instead.

 CSCuo10896

  Symptom : A secure port might fail to learn the MAC address as a secure MAC address. 
  Conditions : You might see this symptom when a MAC address moves from an unsecure to a secure port. 
  Workaround : Clear the dynamic MAC address for the address in question.

 CSCum76673

  Symptom : When you downgrade from Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(6) to Release 6.2(2a) and have a large-scale configuration, the older version may not be able to handle the same scale which might cause the VDC and/or ports to move to failure state. 
  Conditions : You might see this symptom when you are working with a large-scale configuration and  you downgrade from Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(6) to Release 6.2(2a). 
  Workaround : Reduce the scale of the configuration and reload the affected VDC or port.

 CSCun66506

  Symptom : NetScaler shows channel LA/1 bundle ports in down state, after their link is down. 
  Conditions : You might see this symptom when  you remove  ports in quick succession among Nexus and NetScaler.
  Workaround : Bring up the affected links. Remove the links, waiting for 30 seconds before removing the next one each time.

 CSCun99702

  Symptom : If you are working with a running configuration with has one or more IPv6 Object-groups with wild card masking, ISSD is being allowed from Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(8) to any release that does not support IPv6 wild card masking; that is, any previous release. 
  Conditions : Object-group configurations with IPv6 wild card masking must be present. With this configuration, an ISSD from the Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(8) with support for IPv6 wild card to a lower Release without support for IPv6 wild card matching did not throw an incompatibility error.
  Workaround : Delete all the Object-group rules with wild card masks and then perform the ISSD.

 CSCuo02632

  Symptom : When you are working with IPv6 and you add a large number of interfaces, you might see both supervisors reload. 
  Conditions : This symptom might be seen when  you add a  large number of ingress interfaces using the interface range. This symptom is rarely seen when >400 interfaces are added with range command.
  Workaround : Add the ingress interfaces one by one.

  Workaround : None.

 CSCun06330

  Symptom : When you are working with F2 and M1 Series modules in the same mixed-mode VDC with an interface configured under RISE and you add a SPAN-related configuration, you might not see the SPAN configuration removed when you remove the RISE configuration. 
  Conditions : This symptom might be seen when  you are working with F2 and M1 Series modules in the same mixed-mode VDC with an interface configured under RISE and you add a SPAN-related configuration.
  Workaround : Save the original configuration and reapply after you shut down the RISE service.

 CSCup70873

  Symptom : The DSCP2Q mapping is broken after you upgrade by reload.
  Conditions : This issue might be seen if you upgrade from Release 6.2(6) to Release 6.2(6a) by reload. This symptom persists even if you then upgrade from 6.2(6a) to Release 6.2(8).
  Workaround : First configure the  hardware qos dscp-to-queue ingress command and then configure the  copy running-config startup-config command.

  Conditions : This issue has been seen on M1 Series modules. 
  Workaround : Clear the MAC address-table.

 CSCup53102

  Symptom : Netflow doesn't account for 1:100 multiplier in Sampler Options.
  Conditions : This issue might be seen for Netflow in your Nexus 7000 switch with an F2, F2e, or F3-only VDC. This issue is not seen in M series modules where there is not additional/system default sampler. This issue is not seen in M series modules or an F3 module with a mixed VDC of F2/F2e modules.
  Workaround : None.

 CSCup59971

  Symptom : End hosts that are sending packets through the Cisco ASR 9000 Series routers and the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switches experience packet loss in the range of 6-8 seconds because the switchover time from Secondary to Primary is a slow.
  Conditions : The MC-LAG is configured on the router-to-switch setup with a VPC.
  Workaround : Remove VPC on the switch and remove the  mlacp switchover maximize links configuration on router.

 CSCup66561

  Symptom : NTP daemon starts crashing and the following messages are displayed:
  2014 Jun 12 19:18:42 switch %$ VDC-1 %$ %SYSMGR-2-LAST_CORE_BASIC_TRACE: : PID 686 with message non-sysmgr(non-sysmgr) crashed, core will be saved.  
  2014 Jun 12 19:18:42 switch %$ VDC-1 %$ %SYSMGR-2-LAST_CORE_BASIC_TRACE: : PID 688 with message non-sysmgr(non-sysmgr) crashed, core will be saved. 
  Conditions : This issue might b seen after you configure one or more NTPv6 server.
  Workaround : Remove the NTPv6 configuration and roll back to NTPv4.

 CSCup85222

  Symptom : A host may not be able to resolve ARP for its HSRP GW if it is single-homed to a VPC secondary device with a dual-active exclude interface-VLAN configuration is on the SVI that hosts the HSRP VIP.
  Conditions : This issue might be seen if the following conditions apply:

 The Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switches are in a vPC.
 The peer-keepalive is up and the peer-link is down.
 The  dual-active exclude interface-vlan command is configured for the SVI.
 There are no other Layer 2 route between the VPC peers for the Vlan.
 The VPC secondary is HSRP active.

  Workaround : None.

 CSCup97564

  Symptom : There is a difference in time between parent switch and FEX switch. After you clear the counter on FEX host interface port, the show-interface counter does not reset to 0 sec. Instead the counter resets to a value that is equal to the time difference between the parent switch and the FEX.
 Conditions: This issue might be seen if your FEX is a 2248PQ.
 Workaround: None.

 CSCuq05308

  Symptom : After you reload your switch or after you reload your nondefault VDCs, the breakout configuration and breakout ports for the nondefault VDC are out of sync.
  Conditions : This issue might be seen during any of the following scenarios:
  1. An interface breakout is done in the nondefault VDC and one of the following occurs before the switch is reloaded:
 – Either the  copy running-config startup-config command is not issued in the nondefault VDC or the  write erase command is not issued in the nondefault VDC 
 – The  copy running-config startup-config command is issued in the default VDC.
  2. An interface breakout is done in the nondefault VDC and the switch is running Release 6.2(8a) or an earlier release and one of the following occurs before the switch is reloaded:
 – The  copy running-config startup-config command is not issued in the nondefault VDC. 
 – The  copy running-config startup-config command is issued in the default VDC.




Note In Release 6.2.10, you must issue the copy running-config startup-config command in the default VDC before your can issue the command in the nondefault VDC. 




  3. An interface breakout is done in the nondefault VDC and one of the following occurs before the switch is reloaded: Either the  copy running-config startup-config command is not issued in the nondefault VDC or the command is issued in the default VDC and the  no interface breakout  command is issued on the interface that is broken.
  Workaround : Perform the one of the following workarounds:
 – To avoid the issue any time that a breakout/no breakout is done in a nondefault VDC: Either issue the c opy running-config startup-config command in both the default and nondefault VDCs or issue the  copy running-config startup-config vdc-all command in the default VDC
 – For scenario 2 (An interface breakout is done in the nondefault VDC and the switch is running Release 6.2(8a) or an earlier release): Issue the  no interface breakout command on the port in the nondefault VDC for which breakout configuration and breakout ports are out of sync and issue the  interface breakout command on the port in the default VDC for which breakout configuration and breakout ports are out of sync.
 – Perform the following steps:
  1. Power off the module on which the breakout configuration and breakout ports are out of synch.
  2. Purge the running configuration on the module by using the  purge module  module #  running-config  command.
  3. Power on the module and allocate the interfaces.
  4. Issue either the  copy running-config startup-config command in both the default and nondefault VDCs or issue the  copy running-config startup-config vdc-all  in the default VDC.

 CSCup70887

  Symptom : Flowcontrol statistics incrementing when TxPPP/RxPPP priority-flow-control signals being sent/received.
  Conditions : Occurs when per-priority pause is configured.
 Workaround: Use the 'show interface flowcontrol' command to verify TxPPP/RxPPP signals.

 CSCuq20660

  Symptom : ‘show interface’ command displays incorrect MTU on subinterface
  Conditions : Occurs when the network QoS based MTU is configured to changed the port MTU. (This is only a display issue. The hardware is programmed correctly.)
 Workaround: Apply the port MTU on the port-channel parent and then on the subinterfaces.

 CSCuq50149

  Symptom : No latency buffer to accommodate "no drop" behavior from FCoE with default FCoE qos policy.
  Conditions : Occurs when the F2/F2e linecards support the long-haul (>=2km) FCoE multihop.
 Workaround: Modify the default service policy support lossless FCoE over long distance.

 CSCuq50479

  Symptom : ORIB generates core file when killed. 
 Also seen while simultaneously restarting the otv-isis process and polling the otv mibs.
  Conditions : Occurs intermittently.
 Workaround: N/A

 CSCuq69858

  Symptom : Layer 2 instabilities occur in 2 VDCs connected by VPC. Some BPDUs are lost.
  Conditions : Occurs in a large scale STP setup (800 VLANs with rapid-PVST).
 Workaround: Use MST instead of rapid-PVST (reduces number of BPDUs).

 CSCuq92989

  Symptom : Input discards are observed on interfaces carrying FCoE traffic.
  Conditions : Occurs while performing ISSU (Cisco Nexus release 6.2(2) to Cisco Nexus release 6.2(8a)) with F2E linecards in an FCoE multihop environment with long-distance (2 km or greater) links.
 Workaround: N/A

  Symptom : Enabling hardware resource pooling results in error %ACLMGR-3-ACLMGR_PPF_ERROR: PPF error: DDB Error: 0x41170040 (ddb_srv_rtrmtln_remove/460)
  Conditions : Occurs when hardware resource pooling is enabled after changing ACL currently applied to a WCCP policy.
 Workaround: Do change ACLs applied to WCCP policies and do not enable resource pooling.

 CSCur11844

  Symptom : Links flap repeatedly until they reach link flap error-disabled status.
  Conditions : Occurs on Cisco Nexus release 6.2.8(a) when bringing up a 10G DWDM link between Cisco Nexus 7000 devices connected over a Siemens WAN.
 Workaround: Increase the link debounce timer starting at 500 ms and increasing it in 500 ms increments until the link stabilizes. Flap the link (on both ends) with the shut/no shut commands after each increase. (On the DWDM/UVN/WAN circuit make sure to disable the automatic link suspension (ALS).)

 CSCuj04442

  Symptom : Switchport trunk allowed VLAN configuration is not propagated to inherited interfaces.
  Conditions : Problem happens in large scale configuration (80+ interfaces in profile) when there are multiple add statements and the system is also processing interface up/down or peer link up/down.
  Workaround : Add VLANs on port manually. 

 CSCuq01463

  Symptom : After flapping core link which is a port channel interface, EIGRP is not registering with BFD but remaining protocols such as PIM, OSPF, and ISIS are fine.
  Conditions : After flapping core link. 
  Workaround : Restart EIGRP Neighborships (clear ip eigrp adj). 

 CSCur17682

  Symptom : When Qos network template, Cos2q,DSCP2q mapping is changed with heavy congested traffic that can cause heartbeat failure on stats client and stat's client crashes. Also the configuration change might not be applied on all ports because traffic needs to be stopped to apply the configuration and due to congestion traffic was not stopped. 
  Conditions : Heavy congestion on multiple ports and very corner case. 
 Effected Image : 6.2.10 
 Product : Nexus 7k and Nexus 7700
 module : applicable for all modules
  Workaround : Stop the traffic/prevent congestion when changing network qos Template,cos2q,dscp2q. 

 CSCur18408

  Symptom : WCCP egress policy programming happened only on first instance and not programmed on the remaining instances. 
  Conditions : Resource pooling and bank mapping CLI are toggled multiple times. WCCP policy is applied/removed/modified several times.
  Workaround : Remove the egress RACL, Egress WCCP policy. Apply it back.

 CSCur18519

  Symptom : On FEX setups or setups with ports in port fast mode, quick range VLAN delete/adds can cause missing GWMACs in Linecard.
  Conditions : The Linecard could be under stress due to previous command like VDC reload, PL flap. Under these conditions, issue is more likely.
  Workaround : When a range of VLANs are deleted and added, user must have a reasonable delay of a few minutes between the delete and add. Test command < test l2fm dump smac > can be used in case if error happens. Please contact l2fm before you run the test command.

 CSCur23572

  Symptom : ETPM sequence timeout and interface err-disabled. 
  Conditions : This happens during stress test after hundreds of interface changes, VLAN add removal.
  Workaround : None

 CSCur23775

  Symptom : ACL QoS process might crash on LC during PBR/QOS changes. 
  Conditions : During high stress - ACL/QOS/PBR policies changes ACLQOS in LC might crash
 the steps required to hit this issue.
 Remove or add each of the below:
 - VLAN
 - QoS
 - ACL from PBR
 - delete add VLAN
 - delete/add SVI
 - delete/add inherit with QoS configuration
  Workaround : None

 CSCur25911

  Symptom : Stale FTAG entries in PIXM leading to wrong hardware programming with triggers.
 Due to stale entry in the PC, FTAG 0 entry will be cleaned up from the FTAG-ERBID table.
 This affects the traffic driving FTAG 0. Which results in packet drop on VPC leg. 
  Conditions : VPC+ to VPC conversion in F2 based setup. 
  Workaround : VDC reload or deconfigure and configure back vPCs.

 CSCuq91958

  Symptom : On F2/F3 cards, at the tunnel termination point, the frames are replicated further towards the trunk interfaces. As the bug describes, the default CoS value will not be retained (what was set in tunnel head end) and instead would be observed to be 0.
  Conditions : The frames as observed on a downstream trunk port at the point of tunnel termination.
  Workaround : None

 CSCur32662

  Symptom : During an ISSU from 6.2.8a to 6.2.10, if there are ACLs applied on port channel members, the aclmgr will keep crashing on the supervisor card.
  Conditions : This issue happened during ISSU from 6.2.8a to 6.2.10, if there are ACLs applied on port channel members, the aclmgr will keep crashing. This can happen when we applied ACLs on some interfaces and later on we change these interfaces to port channel members. In this situation, due to an existing issue in 6.2.8a (which has been fixed in 6.2.10), the ACLs on the member interface will not be removed, which will cause the aclmgr crash during ISSU.
  Workaround : In old release (6.2.8a or earlier), if there are ACLs applied on port channel members, we should remove these ACLs before attempting the upgrade.

 CSCul05775

  Symptom : On F3 module only
 The F3 module does not support SGT tagged packets (CMD Headers) without a 802.1Q tag.
 When SGT is configured without trunking, the F3 module drops the SGT tagged packets.
  Conditions : This symptom is seen on the F3 Series module when the following are configured:
 – L3 links
 – L2 links (access/trunk) that don't carry VLAN
 – Sup originated traffic
  Workaround : There are two possible workarounds for this issue:
 1. Use an L3 sub-interface to impose a 801.1Q header on the packets.
 Example:

interface Ethernet1/41


 cts manual


 policy static sgt 2 trusted


 no shutdown


 


interface Ethernet1/41.1


 encapsulation dot1q 1121


 ip address 10.10.1.2/30


 no shutdown


 

 2. Use SVIs instead of L3 links and apply trunking on L2 interfaces to carry the SVI traffic.
 Example:

interface Vlan311


 no shutdown


 ip address 10.21.1.1/30


  


interface Ethernet1/43


 cts manual


 policy static sgt 2 trusted


 switchport


 switchport mode trunk


 switchport trunk allowed vlan 311


 no shutdown

  

 CSCul42680

  Symptom : When you are working with vPC and the ports on a FEX module go up and down, some MAC addresses will be missing on the primary vPC. The MAC address is deleted from the Peer 1 as a part of the shutdown even though Peer 1 did not receive an age notification from Peer 2.
  Conditions : This symptom might be seen when the MAC address is on Peer 2 synchronized to Peer 1. As there is traffic on Peer 2, the MAC address does not age out on Peer 2. However, the MAC address ages out on Peer 1, which sends an age notification to Peer 2. Then, the fabric port channel on Peer 1 goes up and down.
  Workaround : Configuring clear mac address-table dynamic on both peers causes the MAC addresses to be relearned on Peer 2 and synced to Peer 1.

 CSCul66816

  Symptom : You might see the ingress dropped bytes counter value at zero or less than dropped packets. 
  Conditions : This symptom might be seen when you are working in any configuration.

  Conditions : This symptom might be seen if you are working with POAP.
  Workaround : None.

 CSCul90173

  Symptom : When using the vPC track feature, the vPC is brought down at the moment when the tracking object goes down. After some time (30 sec—configured UP interval) the vPC is restored although the tracking object is down. 
  Conditions : This symptom might be seen when you configure the vPC track feature and bring down the remote side of the link.
  Workaround : None.

 CSCul96740

  Symptom : Cannot configure all the VLANs; limited by resource template.
  Conditions : This symptom might be seen when the VLAN mgr creates 3 VLANs—1, 4040, and 4042—on system boot up. There are now from 622 onwards. If the resource manager counts these 3 Boot Up reserved VLAN as resources, then you can create only 1021 VLANs and will receive an error.
  Workaround : None.

 CSCum06933

  Symptom : When a module receives CRC errors marked FATAL, then the module is reloaded.
  Conditions : This symptom might be seen when a fabric is removed. It is not seen when a fabric is reloaded, powered-down, or powered-up.
  Workaround : Put the fabric out of service by entering the out-of-service xbar x command before removing the fabric.

 CSCum07092

  Symptom : When you enter the show interface ex/y capabilities breakout command, the switch displays the available breakout maps for CB40 interfaces, even though the breakout is not supported on it.
  Conditions : This symptom might be seen if you are working on an interface of CB40 on an F3 Series module.
  Workaround : None.

 CSCum09180

  Symptom : The ACL log is not getting rate limited when RACL merges with the NetFlow sampler.

 CSCus24678

  Symptom : For a specific port-channel number, an interface can error-disable when trying to add a normal (non-fex) interface to a normal (non-fex) port-channel for reason type "error". The fail will happen when the Cisco Nexus 7000 thinks that a "regular port is
 being added to a fex port-channel" as seen from the logs in 'show system internal spm event-history errors" even though the port-channel is configured as a normal one.
  Conditions : -This issue has been seen on Cisco Nexus 7000 SUP2 on 6.1(3) and on 6.1(4a), but exact conditions are unknown.
  Workaround : Two workarounds:
 1. Add a FEX HIF interface to the port-channel. Then remove the FEX HIF interface and remove the port-channel. Reconfigured the port-channel from a normal (non-FEX) interface.
 Steps:
  1. Create affected port-channel number
  2. Add FEX HIF interface to the port-channel (ethx/x/x)
  3. Remove the FEX HIF interface
  4. Remove port-channel (no interface port-channel [x])
  5. Under non-FEX interface (Ethx/x) create the port-channel (channel-group mode x [active])
 Should work at this point.

 2. VLAN type change fails
 SYS-N7K2-AGG-LEAF(config-vlan)# vlan 1520
 SYS-N7K2-AGG-LEAF(config-vlan)# private-vlan isolated
 ERROR: VLAN 1520 : type change failed
  Conditions : When Private-vlan VPCs are already up and a "no vlan [vlan-range]" and then vlans are created again and changed to pvlan type
  Workaround : 1. Do a shut no-shut on the error disabled port to bring it up
 SYS-N7K2-AGG-LEAF(config)# interface ethernet 2/39
 SYS-N7K2-AGG-LEAF(config-if)#shut
 SYS-N7K2-AGG-LEAF(config-if)#no shut
   
 2. If VLAN type change to PVLAN type did not succeed for a particular vlan or range of vlans, configure the type change through for those vlans yet again:
 SYS-N7K2-AGG-LEAF(config-vlan)# vlan 1520
 SYS-N7K2-AGG-LEAF(config-vlan)# private-vlan isolated
 SYS-N7K2-AGG-LEAF(config-vlan)# exit

 CSCus31599

  Symptom : On a M108 module, ports 1 and 2 were reporting as "rate-mode dedicated" while ports 3-8 reported as "rate-mode shared".
  Conditions : All conditions unknown at this time.

  Workaround : Create dummy VDC.
 Allocate interfaces to new/dummy VDC. (interfaces report correct rate-mode at this time).
 Allocate interfaces back to originating VDC. (interfaces should still report correct rate-mode now).

Resolved Caveats—Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(12)

 CSCuq96822

  Symptom : Heartbeat looping and crashes due to timeout.
  Conditions : Occurs when 4000 VLANs are assigned to an interface.
 Workaround: Assign smaller number of VLANs.

 CSCur22182

  Symptom : snmpwalk aborts when performing a snmpwalk on CISCO-BGP4-MIB, when any bgp peer is configured with both VPNv4 Unicast AF(afi=1, safi=128), IPv6 Unicast AF (afi=2, safi=1) and/or IPv6 Multicast AF(afi=2, safi=2). Snmpwalk on the following tables are affected and will not be queried completely and aborts when querying VPNv4 unicast AF of any peer with above mentioned configuration:
 - cbgpPeerAddrFamilyTable
 - cbgpPeerAddrFamilyPrefixTable
 - cbgpPeer2AddrFamilyTable
 - cbgpPeer2AddrFamilyPrefixTable
 This issue will abort snmpwalk on cbgpPeer (1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.187.1.2) or any oid tree that includes these tables.
 Example:
 .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.187.1.2.7.1.3.1.4.19.0.101.6.2.1 = IPv6 Unicast
 .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.187.1.2.7.1.3.1.4.19.0.101.6.1.128 = VPNv4 Unicast
 <snmpwalk aborts here>
  Conditions : Occurs when any bgp peer is configured with both VPNv4 Unicast AF(afi=1, safi=128), IPv6 Unicast AF (afi=2, safi=1) and/or IPv6 Multicast AF(afi=2, safi=2)
  Workaround : Since this issue breaks the snmpwalk to cbgpPeer and the other oid trees which queries the tables in CISCO-BGP4-MIB, snmpwalks can work only with oid trees which do not include CISCO-BGP4-MIB, under this configuration/scenario without aborting. The CISCO-BGP4-MIB tables can be queried separately to get the information from the unaffected tables. Further, snmpget is not affected by this issue and will provide the correct outputs but can only be used to query specific oids.

 CSCur24427

  Symptom : VLAN MGR sequence timed out syslog seen on doing a delete for a range of PVLANS. This is seen only when the number of PVLANS is around 40 in the system.
  Conditions : This happens when there are 40 or more PVLANS configured and a range delete operation on VLANS is attempted. 
  Workaround : Even though the event seq for PVLAN times out, the delete is successful. The VLANs are deleted from the system. 

 CSCur29530

  Symptom : Static route is floated again after deleting static bfd configuration even we already did shutdown interface.
  Conditions : Device Info:
 SUP2
 F248XP
 Version: 6.2(6b)
 To remove static bfd configuration after shut down interface.
  Workaround : To remove "static bfd" first before shutdown interface, the problem symptom doesn't happen.

 CSCur30373

  Symptom : On F3 module only:
 We are seeing that SGT with only lower 8 bits of the configured SGT is derived from the IPFIB.
 Example of SGT not being reflected.
 n77k1-dc2-core1(config)# cts role-based sgt-map 10.21.10.56 21456

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 208 10.21.10.56 192.168.2.220 0 0 Ethernet1/35 (1)ICMP 4
  Conditions : On F3 module only:
 The issue occurs if using SGT value Source tag > 255
  Workaround : None

 CSCur32745

  Symptom : L3 route does not forwarded on Port-channel interfaces. 
  Conditions : With two PC member from different Linecards
 Having another L3 port in the same ASIC.
 Removing one of the member from the PC causes LIF not published to SDB.
 Route added later to the L3 Port-channel will fail.
  Workaround : Flap the L3 port-channel after PC member removal. 

 CSCur25124

  Symptom : Route updates from a Layer 2 VPN are not processed and there might be traffic loss. No further updates will be processed.
  Conditions : This problem might occur on an ISSU to a 6.2.10 version.
  Workaround : A SUP switchover will correct the problem.

 CSCur09585

  Symptom : There is false High voltage alarms on DWDM Sumitomo SFP 10G
  Conditions : Normal condition
  Workaround : None

 CSCuo31207

  Symptom : In an F1 only VDC in a Cisco Nexus 7000, the  default interface ethernet  x/y command does not remove all configuration from interfaces which are port-channel members.
  Conditions : This issue only occurs in F1 only VDCs configured with "limit-resource module-type f1".
 Workaround: Entering the  default interface command removes any of the remaining configuration.

 CSCus21952

  Symptom : Layer 3 traffic does not egress out of trunk secondary port/PC/VPC. 
  Conditions : Routed traffic gets dropped and does not egress out of PVLAN trunk secondary port.
  Workaround : None

 CSCus25882

  Symptom : No traffic rate on interface.
 As soon as interface comes up, log occurs.
  Conditions : N/A
  Workaround : Hard reset of module would resolve the issue for few days but issue re-occurs.

 CSCus29110

  Symptom : When we are polling for the oid ipNetToPhysicalPhysAddress for certain IPv6 neighbors, the MAC addresses are not returned. This issue is seen only for neighbors that are more than five weeks old.
  Conditions : Some neighbors (age around five weeks) are missing in the SNMP data base and the same is present in icmpv6 and ND databases. 
  Workaround : Clear the IPv6 neighbor. 

 CSCus35514

  Symptom : Telnet hostname not working. Other protocols are working (ping/ssh). 
  Conditions : N/A
  Workaround : Use host IP address instead of host name. 

 CSCus57051 

  Symptom : Failure recovery action:
 “Standby will be rebooted to force net boot and image download”.
 Install has failed. Return code 0x4093005E (system switchover failed).
 Please identify the cause of the failure, and try 'install all' again.
  Conditions : ISSU from 6.2(8a) to 6.2.10. 
  Workaround : Upgrade without ISSU. 

 CSCur31394

  Symptom : aclmgr crash is seen when applying/removing large ACL configuration to SVI, for example:
 interface vlan 1-800
 no ip access-list X
 will see something like:
 SYSMGR-2-SERVICE_CRASHED: Service "aclmgr" (PID 6058) hasn't caught signal 6 (core will be saved)
  Conditions : This is not traffic impacting.
  Workaround : Apply ACL configuration in smaller chunks. For example:

interface vlan 1-100 


no ip access-list X 

  

 CSCur00775

  Symptom : For an SNMP clear, some SNMP related counters are not cleared. 
  Conditions : Occurs for an M1 linecard.
 Workaround: N/A

 CSCur66762

  Symptom : URIB might use (backup) routes with BGP PIC EDGE. 
  Conditions : When BGP PIC EDGE is enabled and backup route has a better AD or metric. 
  Workaround : None

 CSCus52559

  Symptom : Whenever multicast traffic is flooded with MD flood LTL as the DI and if the chassis has any M modules that are powered up, the MD flood received in the M module is flooded back to the fabric.
 This packet on reaching the F2e/F3 cards triggers egress MAC learn which sometimes could overwrite an existing MAC entry with a wrong destination port.
  Conditions : Conditions in which this issue could happen are:
 1. Any M-series module should be up in the chassis
 AND
 2. MD flood LTL will be used always if Private VLAN SVI part of OIF list for the mutlicast group 
 OR
 3. Until an optimised multicast MD LTL is obtained for a mutlicast group, MD flood LTL will be used for a very brief period.
  Workaround : None

 CSCur28449

  Symptom : Core generated by vPC component
  Conditions : This core can be generated under scenarios when the vPC ports are coming up and failure happens in other parts of the system such as a linecard reload.
 It is triggered by a failure to respond in time by the sdb component. 
  Workaround : No functional impact. The vPC process restarts and continues the processing it was doing.

 CSCuo82450

  Symptom : An egress FCoE interface log output discards during congestion even though pause frames are sent upstream on the ingress interface. Pause frames received on the egress interface do not prevent the output discards.
 Affected ingress interfaces can be identified when the 'ENABLED' field is 1 in the output of the following module-level command:

<b>show hardware internal qengine inst <i>inst-num</i> table vq_voq_td</b> 

  
 where <i>inst-num</i> = quotient of (the port number - 1) / 4. For example, to verify Ethernet1/1 is affected using 'slot 1' and 'inst 0' as arguments to the above command:

<pre>


 switch# slot 1 show hardware internal qengine inst 0 table vq_voq_td | include "port|ENABLE|^0"


 | Inst 0; port(s) 1-4


 INDEX QUEUE PKT TYPE VL THRESHOLD ENABLE


 0 8q CRD DE 0 14400 1


</pre>

  
  Conditions : This issue only applies to interfaces with a ‘no drop’ CoS, that is, FCoE interfaces. An interface will be affected by this issue only after a supervisor switchover (this includes ISSU/ISSD switchovers) and then the interface flaps for any reason (this includes moving the interface into a port channel). 
 For Nexus 7000/7700 switches, the first affected release is NX-OS release 6.2(2).
 For MDS 9500/9700 switches, the first affected release is NX-OS release 6.2(7).
  Workaround : To nondisruptively restore the ‘no drop’ functionality, set the priority flow control to ‘on’ and back to ‘auto’ for each affected ingress interface. If the interface is a member of a port channel then the change should be done at the port channel interface level. For example:

 switch(config-if)# <b>interface port-channel 1</b>


 switch(config-if)# <b>priority-flow-control mode on</b>


 switch(config-if)# <b>priority-flow-control mode auto</b>


 

 The above workaround can only be applied to interfaces which are up. This will restore the potency of pause frames on the Ethernet interfaces. However, further port flaps will cause the issue to recur on the interface.

 CSCuu47597

  Symptom : BGP restarts automatically (without manual or automatic configuration) when FabricPath is enabled.
  Conditions : When the FabricPath feature is enabled, BGP automatically restarts. Enabling of the Layer 2 Multi-Path (L2MP) feature-set causes this action. The following message is generated:

 %BGP-5-SELF_RESTART: BGP self-restarting due to feature-set l2mp enabled

  
  Workaround : The FabricPath feature should not be enabled during production hours since the automatic restart of BGP can result in traffic loss.

 CSCus68892 

  Symptom : On January 27, 2015, a buffer overflow vulnerability in the GNU C library (glibc) was publicly announced.

 CSCur26436

  Symptom : Nexus 7000 and MDS 9000 switches include a version of SSL that is affected by the vulnerability identified by the Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) IDs:
 CVE-2014-3566
  Conditions : A POODLE exploit requires a man in the middle attack between the switch (the LDAP client utilizing the SSL client) and the LDAP server. Nexus 7000 and MDS 9000 both contain an SSL client with SSLv3 support. The client supports fall back to SSLv3 if negotiation with TLS 1.0 fails. 
 The LDAP feature may be configured to utilize this client. This feature is disabled by default. Hence, this vulnerability only exists if the LDAP feature is enabled.
  Workaround : This issue is resolved. 

 CSCur30049 

  Symptom : BGP sets next-hop-self for self-originated routes. not RFC4271 compliant, we need RPM to add bgp-redist-unchanged for setting ip next-hop.

 CSCui36126

  Symptom : Same subnet primary & secondary on interface.
 Advertising the same in EIGRP. We see the connected route in EIGRP topology. However, if I remove the secondary IP address from the interface, it breaks EIGRP for primary IP too.
 EIGRP topology will not show the connected prefix even though it is configured on that interface.
  Conditions : Same subnet primary & secondary on interface.
  Workaround : Shut/no shut on the interface fixes the issue.

 CSCui51673

  Symptom : After removing EIGRP from an interface the network is no longer injected into the EIGRP topology table.
  Conditions : EIGRP must have been configured on the interface.

 CSCuq96869

  Symptom : Some routes may either be missing or mis-programmed.
  Conditions : At VDC reload some early new route updates might be processed and dropped before processing the vdc-create. this causes ipfib to ignore the messages since they will be treated as invalid. Issue is seen during line card reload and during issu as well.This is a corner case timing issue and very rare
  Workaround : This issue is resolved.

 CSCur03040

  Symptom : Nexus 7000 may experience a process crash with OTV configuration.

 CSCur07262

  Symptom : Port-channels using LACP fast-rate will not pass traffic.
  Conditions : Occurs when completing a supervisor switchover, the “show lacp interface ethernet x/x” command displays that the port is invalid for LACP and that the channel-group is invalid with a value of 0. The port counters for LACP PDUs do not move in the TX or RX direction, hence the device connected to the switch shows its member ports in a suspend state.
 Workaround: This issue is resolved.

  Conditions : Ingress LC missing HW entry for forwarding engine.
  Workaround : This issue is resolved.

 CSCur24099

  Symptom : This is a feature enhancement to improve the handling of ejector open/close events. Open events of both top and bottom ejectors (On Fabric or Interface modules) will trigger the card to power down in preparation to be removed from the system.
 The following error message will be seen in the log:
 %PLATFORM-3-EJECTOR_STAT_CHANGED: Ejectors' status in slot <slot #> has changed, Top Ejector is CLOSE, Bottom Ejector is OPEN
 %PLATFORM-3-EJECTOR_STAT_CHANGED: Ejectors' status in slot <slot #> has changed, Top Ejector is OPEN, Bottom Ejector is OPEN
  Conditions : It is possible under certain conditions (excessive noise and/or interference) that ejector signals can be falsely interpreted. This can lead to ejectors being declared as open when in fact they are closed. It's also possible to see ejector open/close messages for slots without cards. 
 If all Fabric modules see such a problem at the same time and power down, this will in turn trigger all Interface Module to also power down. 
 The system will recover by itself and once the ejectors close again the module(s) will be powered back on.
  Workaround : This issue is resolved.

 CSCur24212

  Symptom : dhcp_snoop process crashing due to a memory leak. 
  Conditions : If there are drops in relay packet due to interface error then memory leak happens for the process.
 Interface error counter can be seen in show ip dhcp relay statistics(drop reasons). 
  Workaround : This issue is resolved.

 CSCur26119

  Symptom : EIGRP interface/adjacency flap may cause some EIGRP prefixes not to be sent.
  Conditions : This has been seen with when using route tagging with distribute list, however this is not an absolute cause and effect.
 Occurrence of the issue is unpredictable given it also requires rare internal EIGRP condition when forming route-update packets.
  Workaround : This issue is resolved.

 CSCur29527

  Symptom : Cisco Nexus 7000 forwards IPv6 packets with link-local as source IPv6 address.
  Conditions : Cisco Nexus 7000 learns the default route from its BGP peer over MPLS link. The packet with link-local as source-address is seen to be forwarding.
  Workaround : This issue is resolved.

 CSCur33701

  Symptom : On a Cisco Nexus 7000 with LISP configured, after a line card reload, OIR, or insertion, not all of the LISP /32 routes may be downloaded to the card once it is powered up and is brought online. This results in traffic being forwarding to the supervisor and being limited by the COPP policy on the switch. Traffic flows may be forwarded at a reduced rate or not at all. This can be verified with a "show forwarding route <prefix>" command, which will show the /32 route installed on other line cards with a valid next-hop address, but on the problem linecard, it may show a /25 route with "receive" as it's next-hop.
  Conditions : This can occur with a Cisco Nexus 7000 running LISP Discovery, where /32 hosts are learned on the Cisco Nexus 7000 via LISP. The problem can appear when a line card is reloaded, OIRd, or a new card is installed, and the card is powered up and brought online. This affects traffic coming inbound to the ports off the affected card.
  Workaround : This issue is resolved.

 CSCur35982

  Symptom : LISP xTR doesn't register eid prefix, even though more specific prefixes exist in the routing table. We should be registering the prefixes. which have more specific prefixes reachable as well.
  Conditions : See example:
 R2# show ip lisp database
 LISP ETR IP Mapping Database for VRF "default" (iid 0), global LSBs:
 0x00000001
 EID-prefix: 10.2.0.0/16, instance-id: 0, LSBs: 0x00000001, no-route
  Locator: 20.0.2.2, priority: 10, weight: 100
  Uptime: 00:04:32, state: up, local
 R2# show ip route 10.2.0.0
 IP Route Table for VRF "default"
 '*' denotes best ucast next-hop
 '**' denotes best mcast next-hop
 '[x/y]' denotes [preference/metric]
 10.2.0.0/24, ubest/mbest: 2/0
  *via 20.1.2.1, Eth2/1, [110/20], 00:10:01, ospf-1, type-2
  *via 20.1.2.3, Eth2/1, [110/20], 00:10:01, ospf-1, type-2
 R2#
 In this case 10.2.0.0/16 should still be registered to the mapping-system, even though no 10.2.0.0/16 route exists in the rib.
  Workaround : This issue is resolved.

 CSCur38749

  Symptom : A vulnerability in Cisco Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) feature of Cisco NX-OS could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to use SSH connection to a non-existent host covered by lisp mobile prefix 
 from outside of the DC and get presented with the xTR login prompt.
 An attacker still needs to have login credentials for NX-OS device in order to be able to log in.
  Conditions : LISP mobility and lisp enabled interface need to be configured.
  Workaround : This issue is resolved.

 CSCur40130

  Symptom : A user enters the command "show ip bgp regex". After 15 seconds of the command being entered, the exec command prompt appears, and there is no show output displayed.
  Conditions : This occurs to software release of 6.2.10 with over 400k entries in the BGP routing table.
  Workaround : This issue is resolved.

 CSCur50305

  Symptom : Vtp dropped into transparent mode due to some unexpected error condition during VLAN creation/modification, 
 but the reserved VLAN 1002-1005 were not removed. 
 This is preventing vtp mode changes till the reserved VLANs are removed. In vtp transparent mode is possible to remove these VLANs but a second symptom is observed. Vlan manager is logging that vtp is client/server mode so the changes can not be done. 
 As a summary there are two symptoms due to failing to create/update VLAN :
 1) Reserved VLAN 1002-1005 are not removed. Show VLAN will still displaying them.
 2) When vtp drops into transparent mode, VLAN mgr is not able to update VLAN. 
 Ex: 
 swith(config)# no vlan 20-41
 ERROR: VTP VLAN configuration not allowed when device is in CLIENT mode
  Conditions : Feature vtp has to be enabled and an error condition has to happen during VLAN creation/modification.
  Workaround : This issue is resolved.

 CSCur52940

  Symptom : Continuous snmpd process crashes leading to Supervisor HAP reset.
  Conditions : - poll CiscoEntitySensorMIB.
 - have 40G/100G ports and transceivers.

  Symptom : On a Cisco Nexus device, ipqosmgr might crash during bootup. This specific bug would not cause a system running fine to initially reboot. This is only seen while booting.
  Conditions : The Cisco Nexus device is running QoS. 
  Workaround : This issue is resolved.

 CSCur54182

  Symptom : Cisco Nexus 7000 configured for TACACS may face crash due to &quot;Tacacs
 Daemon hap reset&quot;
  Reason: Reset triggered due to HA policy of Reset
  Service: Tacacs Daemon hap reset
  Conditions : On a switch running NX-OS 6.2(10), if a very long command is
 given with remote authorization using TACACS enabled, a crash is seen in TACACS. Because
 TACACS expects the strings to be of size 255, it is unable to handle strings greater than 255.
  Workaround : This issue is resolved.

 CSCur54213

  Symptom : There is an inconsistency on behavior for vPC consistency-check on "Vlan xlt mapping".
 + Case 1 :
 n7kb(config-if)# sh vpc consistency-parameters vpc 30 | i xlt
 Vlan xlt mapping 1 Enabled 10->30 -
 n7kb(config-if)#
 n7kb(config-if)# sh vpc | i role|Po30
 vPC role : secondary, operational primary
 30 Po30 up success success 30
 + Case 2 :
 n7kb(config-if)# sh vpc consistency-parameters vpc 30 | i xlt
 Vlan xlt mapping 1 Enabled 10->30 Enabled
 n7kb(config-if)#
 n7kb(config-if)# sh vpc | i role|Po30
 vPC role : secondary, operational primary
 30 Po30 up failed Vlan mgr VPC compat check 30
 Above two cases should behave in a same manner.
 Both "-" and "Enabled" means VLAN translation is enabled but no parameters are configured.
  Conditions : When using VLAN translation on a vPC.
  Workaround : This issue is resolved.

 CSCur83912 

  Symptom : After switch reload PVLAN was crashing. This crash will only be seen in gdb images, and will not affect final images. This happens when PVLAN is already in an errored state and no PVLAN configuration is going through due PVLAN being in locked state.
  Conditions : The setup was already in an errored state where some of the port-channels in PVLAN db were in an errored state, whereas the member ports of the same port-channels were in a good state with the PVLAN mapping saved in PSS. When box reload was done, the PC and member port configuration did not match, hence when HW programming request for PC was sent after reload, it did not find any PVLAN mappings on PC from PSS and asserted.
  Workaround : This issue is resolved.

Resolved Caveats—Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(10)

 CSCui75194

  Symptom : Observed VRRP negotiation does not takes place in the Cisco NX-OS Release 7.1(0)N1(1). All the VRRP neighbors on the respective switches thinks Master. Changing the priority/shut-no shut would not change the behavior. VRRP not converging on all SVIs, hosts not resolving ARP, cannot run traffic. Saving the ingress packet information on receiving using ip_savecontrol.
  Conditions : VRRP not converging on all SVIs, hosts not resolving ARP, cannot run traffic.
  Workaround : Saving the ingress packet information on receiving using ip_savecontrol

 CSCur03111

  Symptom : MACSEC link goes down in SAP AUTHEN INCOMPLETE state.
  Conditions : Occurs when:
 - C is enabled.
 - Egress traffic rate exceeds the effective line rate for encrypted traffic. (At 6.5G of traffic, CRC errors appear on the peer port and link goes down.)
 Workaround: This issue is resolved.

 CSCur22840

  Symptom : When macsec is configured, we see dropped packets on some interfaces with Bad CRC signature. This is seen after switchover and when linerate exceeds stipulated limit for macsec.
  Conditions : 1. MACSEC is enabled.
 2. egress traffic rate exceeds the effective line rate for encrypted traffic.
 3. Switchover is performed
  Workaround : Limit the traffic egressing out of Macsec ports to less than effective 10G linerate (including Macsec header overhead). This may be roughly 6.5G for 64B packets.
 Enable global pause on the ports in questions.

 CSCuq05747

  Symptom : The ISIS IPv6 metric cannot be correctly parsed on a point-to-point (p2p) interface after a reload.
  Conditions : This issue might be seen if the ISIS interface is set to p2p mode.
  Workaround : After reloading the interface, configure the  isis ipv6 metric command again.

 CSCuo98502

  Symptom : A port-channel interface might not set the MTU correctly even though the  show run interface command output shows the MTU configured under the port-channel interface. For example, jumbo frames may be hardware rate-limited even though the MTU is configured to allow jumbo frames.
  Conditions : This issue may be seen if the MTU is configured on the port-channel member interface before creating the port-channel interface. The MTU may not be set correctly on the port-channel interface itself.
  Workaround : Configure the MTU on the actual port-channel interface instead of the member interface.

 CSCuo90941

  Symptom : The following error is returned when executing the  switchport trunk allowed vlan add command:

N7KA(config-port-prof)# switchport trunk allowed vlan add 6


ERROR: This form of the command has no effect on the current system


N7KA(config-port-prof)#


 

  Conditions : This issue was seen under the following conditions:
 – Port-profile being modified must have been created prior to the ISSU.
 – Cisco Nexus Series device must have been upgraded via ISSU from Cisco NX-OS 6.0(1) to NX-OS Release 6.2(2a), This condition is not present in switches upgraded via disruptive upgrade.
  Workaround : To avoid this symptom, delete and re-create the port profile from scratch after the ISSU. Rebooting the device is not an effective workaround as the condition remains after reloading the switch.

 CSCup81717

  Symptom : The secondary VLAN shut does not take effect on the private-VLAN host and promiscuous ports. On a PVLAN host port and promiscuous port, traffic goes through to the egress ports
  Conditions : This issue might be seen when a secondary VLAN is shut but traffic is seen egressing out from the host or promiscuous ports. The trunk promiscuous and trunk secondary ports are fine.
  Workaround : None

 CSCup43137

  Symptom : Timeout occurs, when VLAN mode changes for all VLANs from Fabricpath to non-Fabricpath.

 CSCur22754

  Symptom : VLAN manager times out on PVLAN during deletion of 2000 primary VLANs. 
  Conditions : To re-create, configure 
 RJ-N7K-1-new-vdc(config)# vlan 1000-3000
 RJ-N7K-1-new-vdc(config-vlan)# mode fabricpath 
 RJ-N7K-1-new-vdc(config-vlan)# private-vlan primary
 RJ-N7K-1-new-vdc(config)# no vlan 1000-3000
  Workaround : When there are 2000 primary VLANs, and if all of them need to be deleted, the workaround is to delete 1000 VLANs at once, instead of all the 2000 VLANs at once. For example in the above sequence, the following configuration will go through fine:
 RJ-N7K-1-new-vdc(config)# vlan 1000-3000
 RJ-N7K-1-new-vdc(config-vlan)# mode fabricpath 
 RJ-N7K-1-new-vdc(config-vlan)# private-vlan primary
 RJ-N7K-1-new-vdc(config)# no vlan 1000-2000
 RJ-N7K-1-new-vdc(config)# no vlan 2001-3000

 CSCuo91958

  Symptom : On F2/F3 cards, at the tunnel termination point, the frames are replicated further towards the trunk interfaces. As the bug describes, the default CoS value is not retained (what was set in tunnel head end) and instead would be observed to be 0.
  Conditions : The frames as observed on a downstream trunk port at the point of tunnel termination.
  Workaround : This issue is resolved. 

 CSCur30073

  Symptom : On a VPC+ setup where Fabricpath multi-topology feature is being used and "no port-channel limit" is not being used, unicast traffic arriving at certain ports in the default topology, directed towards the VPC hosts might fail under certain race conditions.
 The failure might be encountered if in the system described above, if the first few VPCs are de-configured followed by moving ports of the VDC to another VDC and then moving them back in. Based on certain race conditions, this sequence might sometimes cause incorrect forwarding of unicast traffic arriving at those ports (that were moved) if the destination is behind the VPCs on the VLANS belonging to the default topologies.
  Conditions : All of the below conditions are required at a minimum before there is a possibility to hit this issue. 
 1. VPC+ with multiple Fabricpath topologies in use.
 2. No port-channel limit configuration is not being used under VPC domain. If this configuration is being used the issue will not be encountered.
 3. The first few VPC legs that were brought up are de-configured.
 4. Certain ports of the VPC+ VDC are moved out to another VDC and moved back in.
 5. Unicast Traffic is arriving in the switch at any of those ports is directed towards the hosts behind the VPCs on the default Fabricpath topology may experience failure. Traffic on non-default topologies should not be affected.
 This issue can be encountered if the ports that are moved between VDCS are F2, F2E or F3.
  Workaround : This issue is resolved. 

 CSCur01307

  Symptom : Delayed receiver (3 minutes) traffic for newly joined receiver for multicast traffic that is already flowing.

 Workaround: This issue is resolved. 

 CSCul53494

  Symptom : The IP multicast ping over GRE tunnel does not work. The ping packets are dropped at the tunnel destination.
  Conditions : The first or few packets reach the supervisor with the proper SHIM header at the remote side until the (S,G) route is installed in the hardware. All further packets hit this (S,G) and punt to supervisor without the SHIM header, which causes these packets to be dropped by the packet manager. This is a special case where we have (S,G) with punt flag and no OIFs associated with the route. The problem is only seen for tunnel interfaces that need a decap at the tunnel end. A multicast ping over a nontunnel interface does not have this problem.
  Workaround : This issue is resolved. 

 CSCun25245

  Symptom : Packets with unicast IP addresses and multicast MAC addresses are duplicated on the destination interface, which can cause performance issues to the application.

 CSCuq65354

  Symptom : In Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2.2a, a VDC with an F2e line card sends option templates with a sampling rate of configured rate * 100. Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2.6, a VDC with an F2e line card is considered part of a mixed VDC, and the sampling rate is sent as configured to maintain consistent behavior for all the line cards in the VDC. As a result, an issue occurs while plotting the graph for Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2.8.
  Conditions : The graph is being plotted for the byte count for Cisco NX-OS Releases 6.2.6 and 6.2.8.

Workaround: This issue is resolved.

  Workaround : This issue is resolved.

 


 CSCuq13845

  Symptom : SNMP returns a “tooBig(1)” error instead of truncating an encapsulated message to equal or less than maximum message size.
  Conditions : Any of these methods or a combination of these methods can cause the SNMP “tooBig” error:
 – Changing the default setting for the snmp-server packetize command, especially when choosing smaller values
 – Using SNMP tool commands like the -Cr option that request large amounts of data to be returned
 – Using large ifmib ifalias descriptions and having many ports with extremely long descriptions
  Workaround : This issue is resolved.

 CSCuq05409

  Symptom : A high number of messages cause a low memory situation in MTS for the internal SPM process (SAP 487). This results in a crash of SPM and a switchover.
  Conditions : While collecting tac-pac when PPF statistics are taken, the PPF goes into an infinite loop that causes SPM to stop processing messages. This leads to an overload of MTS buffers and the consequent restart of SPM. 
  Workaround : This issue is resolved

 CSCuq05465

  Symptom : When you run the show system internal sdwrap buffers sap 885 command, one MTS message gets stuck in the MTS buffer on the line card and is not cleared.
  Conditions : You run the show system internal sdwrap buffers sap 885 command on a device with the M2 line card.
  Workaround : This issue is resolved.

  Workaround : This issue is resolved.

 CSCuo67870

  Symptom : The vPC VLANs on a trunk interface are incorrectly pruned by VTP on the vPC Operational Secondary Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switch. The interface can be configured as a vPC leg or as a vPC Orphan port.
  Conditions : This issue might be seen on a Cisco Nexus Series 7000 switch vPC setup running Release 6.2(6) or a later release and the switch is also configured to use VTP for VLAN pruning.
 The trigger for the issue is a flap of a vPC leg on the vPC Operational Primary switch. After the link flap, VTP does not successfully process join messages for the VLANs causing a timeout and the VLANs to be pruned from the link.
  Workaround : This issue is resolved.

 CSCuq03603

  Symptom : The output of the  show system internal aclmgr log command in the standby supervisor displays an aclmgr leak in the command library. The size of leak is 196 bytes. per show command

  Workaround : This issue is resolved.

 CSCup96876

  Symptom : Traffic to a subset of hosts is punted to the CPU and either forwarded in software or dropped.
  Conditions : This issue might be seen if you perform an ISSU from Release 6.2(8) to Release 6.2(8a) or from an earlier release to Release 6.2(8) or Release 6.2(8a) and you have M1-XL or M2 modules installed. This issue does not apply to F2 or F3 modules.
 This issue occurs because the FIB entry is programmed in the wrong SPL bank. Consequently, the longest prefix match is not hit and traffic is punted for an ARP glean.
 For example, a host exists in a /24 subnet. In the following output from the  show ip route command to the host shows that a /32 installed is in the RIB. However, checking the longest prefix match in hardware will show the /24 route.

N7K-1# show system internal forwarding ipv4 route 172.22.31.173 module 7

  
  Routes for table default/base 
  ----+---------------------+----------+----------+------+----------- 
  Dev | Prefix | PfxIndex | AdjIndex | LIFB | LIF 
  ----+---------------------+----------+----------+------+----------- 
  1 172.22.31.0/24 0x423e 0xa2cb 0 0x1ff8b <------hardware only finds the /24 entry 
    




Note The /32 entry is present in hardware but since it is programmed in the wrong bank it will always hit the /24 entry.




  Workaround : This issue is resolved.

 CSCuo99830

  Symptom : The port-client core, ISSU failure, ports are suspended.
  Conditions : This issue might be seen during an ISSU from Release 6.1() to Release 6.2(8a). During the ISSU, the line card is upgraded once the SUP switchover is completed and the EthPm sends port commands to the F2module. Just before this occurs, if there are any process crashes, such as a vPC crash or an ungraceful VDC reload, the process crashes when the port commands from EthPm are processed by the port client. The crash might occur because an invalid pay-load size is sent to the port client.
  Workaround : This issue is resolved.

 CSCuo85450

  Symptom : The switch reloads and the following log is displayed in the output of the s how system reset-reason command:

----- reset reason for Supervisor-module 1 (from Supervisor in slot 1) ---

 CSCun26418

  Symptom : The replication ASIC that is responsible for SPAN, OTV encapsulation, and multicast replication stops replicating all traffic and each of these features also fail. This is particular to the SPAN/multicast replication pipeline so customer in an OTV environment will see that multicast traffic (including link-local multicast 224.0.0.0/24), along with broadcast traffic are not forwarded across the overlay.
  Conditions : This issue is might be seen in an OTV environment with a high rate of traffic egressing the OTV join-interface, with ERSPAN configured to span the join-interface. This is not typical.
  Workaround : This issue is resolved.

 CSCuo50598

  Symptom : A Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switch with an F3 module experiences link flaps on port-channels when a VDC is reloaded.
  Conditions : This issue might be seen if there is a port-channel configuration on an F3 module with active traffic.

  Conditions : This issue might be seen if the subinterfaces configured on an F2 module.
  Workaround : This issue is resolved.

 CSCun78718

  Symptom : An incorrect rollback of a failed Port-Profile modification might be seen in some very specific cases on Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switches. As a result of this incorrect PPM rollback, a significant part of the running configuration might be negated on the device. Reloading the device recovers from the issue because the device is re-initialized from its startup configuration.
  Conditions : This is a scalability-related issue. The problem might be seen on heavily over-configured Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switches with many attached Fabric Extenders (FEXs) (~1,500 interfaces on the system, ~10K lines in the output from the  show run all command, ~200 interfaces managed by a single Port-Profile). Under these specific conditions some port-profile operations can take several minutes to be completed or might be rejected.
 This problem might be triggered if two different port-profiles are being modified simultaneously from two different management sessions to the switch (VDC), and both of the two PPM modifications are failed. In this very specific case, two PPM rollback operations might be initiated simultaneously, breaking the normal PPM rollback operation and causing an incorrect completion of the PPM rollback operation.
  Workaround : This issue is resolved.

 CSCuo76751

  Symptom : Port-channel member interfaces stop sending LACP PDUs and go into a LACP suspended state. The ports stop learning MAC addresses and do not pass traffic.
 Ports do not learn MAC addresses. However, still flood traffic.
  Conditions : Port channel member interfaces stop sending LACP PDUs and stop learning when a SPAN destination is configured in a M1 series 32 port in shared mode.
 All the other ports will set the Do not Learn and Do not Forward bit to on.

switch# slot 1 sho hard int mac port 26 state | egrep -i "dont"


 dont_forward: ***On***, dont_learn: ***On***


 

 Ports do not learn MAC addresses when the peer-link is configured in a M1 series 32 port in shared mode. However, when you configure a peer-link member interface in a M1 series 32 port in shared mode disables MAC learning on the other three ports in the port-group.

switch# slot 1 sho hard int mac port 26 state | egrep -i "dont"


 dont_forward: Off, dont_learn: ***On***


 

  Workaround : To restore service when port channel interfaces are in suspended state and stop learning MAC address, you must remove the SPAN and then execute the shut/no shut command for the ports in the port-group.
 To configure a SPAN destination on a port in shared-mode, you must enable ingress learning using the command:

 switchport monitor ingress learning

   
  You must ensure that you do not configure the peer-link member interfaces on an M1 series 32 port in shared mode. For more details on best-practice configuration, see the  Cisco Nexus 7000 Series NX-OS Interfaces Configuration Guide.

 CSCuq39832

 Symptom: A Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switch running a Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2.x prior to 6.2(10) may crash and produce core files in the Resource Manager Daemon.

 –  show resource 
 –  show resource vlan (or another resource name)
 –  show vdc resource detail 
 –  show vdc resource vlan (or another resource name)  detail 
 –  show vdc vdc-name resource 
 –  show vdc vdc-name resource vlan (or another resource name)
 When you frequently allocate or delete VLANs across multiple VDCs, the switch is more susceptible to this issue.
  Workaround : This issue is resolved.

 CSCuq03563

  Symptom : Multicast traffic is not getting forwarding over the non vPC vlan, source VLAN, and destination VLAN that are connected from the switch.
  Conditions : The issue might be seen if the source and destination VLANs are not vPC VLANs.

 CSCui02179

  Symptom : In a large scale setup running rapid Per VLAN Spanning Tree (PVST) on a root bridge change, STP disputes can occur. 
  Conditions : This symptom might be seen on a root bridge change. Multiple sequences of events are triggered starting from Layer 2 to the Layer 3. The number of these sequences is proportional to the number of VLANs in the system. This situation creates contention for the CPU that does not allow enough CPU for STP to send and receive BPDUs to be able to perform the root bridge for all VLANs.
  Workaround : This issue is resolved. 

 CSCui07565

  Symptom : Probe packets sent by the Gold StandbyFabric Loopback test and RewriteEngine test are dropped and the current run of the tests are treated as failed. The HIGH_NULL_POE_DROP_CNT and RO4 TDS timeout interrupt counters also start incrementing for the fabric module.
  Conditions : This symptom might be seen on a Cisco Nexus 7700 switch when the fabric module is power cycled or the fabric ejectors are quickly opened and closed. 
  Workaround : This issue is resolved. 

 CSCui07806

  Symptom : IPv6 Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (URPF)/Redirects is configured on an interface and the  switchport command is configured on the interface. In this case, IPv6 URPF/Redirects get disabled, and the Layer 3 configuration associated with the interface is removed from that interface.
 The interface is again moved to a Layer 3 interface when the  no switchport command is entered on it and an IPv6 address is configured on the interface. In this case, even though the IPv6 URPF/Redirects configuration is not available on the interface, IPv6 URPF/Redirects continues to be enabled on that particular interface because of stale information.
  Conditions : This symptom might be seen when an interface that has IPv6 URPF/Redirects enabled is moved to a switchport, the  no switchport command is entered on that interface, and an IPv6 address is configured. There is no issue (URPF/Redirects is disabled) if the interface is moved to a switchport and the interface continues to be in a switchport state. The issue occurs only after the  no switchport command is entered and an IPv6 address is configured on the interface.
  Workaround : This issue is resolved. 

 CSCui20080

  Symptom : When multiple overlays are defined with VLAN mapping configurations, attempts to roll back fail.
  Conditions : This symptom might be seen when you define multiple OTV overlays, and the rolled back configuration requires a redefinition of VLAN mappings for both overlays, or you add or remove VLAN mappings for both overlays.
  Workaround : This issue is resolved. 

 CSCui25984

  Symptom : MPLS LDP is missing local labels, which can result in LDP not installing labeled routes and not advertising labels to peer LSRs. To confirm this issue, enter the  show mpls ldp internal event err | inc wbool_set command to check for the presence of LDP event traces:

2013 Jul 18 10:06:01.365948 ldp [9075]:ldpx_sched_wbool_set: invalid arg

 CSCuj25197

  Symptom : A Cisco Nexus 7000 Series device sometimes forwards packets across virtual device contexts (VDCs) when it is configured as an emulated switch in a VDC with F2 modules, and with another VDC using M1 modules. The leaking packet is received over a virtual port channel. On the peer, it is received over the peer link on an F2 module and picked up by the M1 modules in another VDC.
  Conditions : This symptom might be seen when the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series device is equipped with a supervisor 2 or 2E.
 These are the triggers for this issue:
 – After the emulated switch is configured, some ports are allocated or deallocated from the VDC.
 – The problem can occur after a FabricPath topology change (clearing adjacencies, peer-link flap).
  Workaround : This issue is resolved.


Resolved Caveats—Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2)

 CSCub54436

  Symptom : Prior to Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2), the spanning tree TCN is transmitted from Nexus 7000 Series device when a new otv extend-vlan command is configured on an overlay interface and the edge device gets selected as an AED. From Cisco NX-OS Release 6.2(2) onwards the TCN transmission does not happen.
  Conditions : When a new otv extend-vlan command is configured and the edge device is selected as an AED.
  Workaround : None

 CSCui20722

  Symptom : The Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Network Analysis Module (Cisco NAM-NX1) and supervisor inband packet counters increment at a higher rate than expected.
  Conditions : This symptom might be seen only if all of the following conditions are met.
 – The monitor session source is supervisor inband.
 – The monitor session destination is Cisco NAM-NX1.
 – GOLD is enabled within the chassis.
 If the monitor session source includes supervisor inband RX, it is possible for internal diagnostic packets to continuously loop from the supervisor to the Cisco NAM-NX1 to the supervisor.
  Workaround : Configure a VLAN filter on the monitor session so that only the desired VLAN or VLANs are spanned. If you wish to monitor all traffic, use 1 to 3967,4048 to 4093 as the filter.

 CSCui08461

  Symptom : Ports can remain in a suspended state. The output of the  show cdp neighbors command for these ports appear as neighbors to themselves.
  Conditions : In Cisco NX-OS Release 6.1(3), an issue exists where a port can go into a suspended state when the online diagnostics feature fails to reset the port programming meant for the port loopback tests. This situation can occur in a rare scenario when online diagnostics is running port loopback tests and the same ports are being allocated to a different VDC. 
 When the device in this state is upgraded to a newer release using an ISSU, the same issue also occurs in the newer release.
  Workaround : Manually run the GOLD tests again on the particular line card or port to reset the state of the port and bring it back to a functional state.

 CSCui08526

  Symptom : The traffic rate on the NAM module data port 1 momentarily drops to almost zero. 
  Conditions : This symptom might be seen immediately after an ISSU or SSO completes.
  Workaround : None.

 – The monitor session source is supervisor inband.
 – The monitor session destination is Cisco NAM-NX1.
 – GOLD is enabled within the chassis.
 If the monitor session source includes supervisor inband RX, it is possible for internal diagnostic packets to continuously loop from the supervisor to the Cisco NAM-NX1 to the supervisor.
  Workaround : Configure a VLAN filter on the monitor session so that only the desired VLAN or VLANs are spanned. If you wish to monitor all traffic, use 1 to 3967,4048 to 4093 as the filter.

 CSCui45691

  Symptom : In a scale setup with debug logs enabled, a few flush requests occur on particular port channels.
  Conditions : This issue is seen in a scale setup where the access layer contains a set of Catalyst 4000 switches.
  Workaround : Avoid any kind of debug logging during a stateful switchover.

 CSCui27887

  Symptom : GISCM logs multiple SC_ONLINE messages like the following to the console for the same module after a switchover.

2013 Jul 24 09:51:11 SITE1-Agg-6 %$ VDC-1 %$ %GISCM-2-AGNIBOOTSTRAP: MOD 4: SC ONLINE


2013 Jul 24 09:51:11 SITE1-Agg-6 %$ VDC-1 %$ %GISCM-2-AGNIBOOTSTRAP: MOD 8: SC ONLINE


2013 Jul 24 09:51:11 SITE1-Agg-6 %$ VDC-1 %$ %GISCM-2-AGNIBOOTSTRAP: MOD 4: SC ONLINE
