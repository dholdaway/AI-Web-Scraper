Special upgrade instructions for HMC V7 R3.1.0

Note: HMC machine type 7315 cannot be upgraded to Version 7 Release 3.1.0. Only HMC machine type 7310 can be upgraded to HMC V7 R3.1.0. The minimum HMC level is V6 R1.2.
Customers with existing HMC machine type 7310 with V6 R1.2 or higher may upgrade to HMC V7 R3.1.0 by ordering the MES (Miscellaneous Equipment Specification) 0962 through their IBM Sales Representative or Business Partner. The HMC code V7 R3.1.0 may also be downloaded, but MES 0962 must still be ordered to complete the conversion from V6 to V7. The MES updates the HMC machine records to ensure continued product support. Machine records are not automatically updated when the code is downloaded so this requirement of ordering MES 0962 is displayed on the download website for the MES. The MCRSA (Machine Control Program Remote Support Agreement) is common for HMC V4, V5, V6, and V7.
For information on converting HMCs from Version 6 to Version 7, please refer to the following document:

HMC Conversion from V6 R1.2 to V7 R3.1.0.

PTF MH01130

HMC V7R330 Service Pack 2 CEC DCA Deactivation fix
This fix is installed on HMC V7R3.3.0 Service Pack 2 (MH01119). You can also reference this package by APAR MB02481.

Fixes

This package includes the following fixes:

This issue applies to IBM Power 595 systems managed by HMCs running V7.3.3.0 Service Pack 2: Repair and Verify will not work if you use the SRC to replace a defective PU Book DCA. SRCs 14012x51 or 14012x52 (where x is 2-9) will identify a defective PU Book DCA. If you are following Repair and Verify via the SRC, then the HMC will not deactivate the PU BOOK DCA. As a result, the PU Book DCA LED remains on. If the repair steps continue, then the PU Book DCA would be pulled hot and cause the system to crash.

This PTF also includes the fix for PTF MH01126 which has been removed from the web. PTF MH01126 addressed the following:

Fixed a problem that allows the Fill and Drain Tool to be activated when you are repairing the P4 Modular Water Unit on IBM Power 575 systems.
Added a graphic that was missing on panel EclipzIHVerifyFDTPumpStart in the Fill and Drain Tool Top Off function on IBM 575 systems.
Fixed an error that occurs during Initial System Fill and System Top Off. The error did not allow the service action to be delayed properly.

Enhancements and fixes

Server and Partition Management

Corrected a problem in the partition create wizard for systems with multiple processor pools defined. The option to select one of those pools is not enabled. This prevents the user from setting up the profile as desired via the create partition/profile wizard.
Corrected a problem with IO tables in Partition Profile dialog. The physical IO table in the Profile Properties dialog no longer was enabling the slot column entries as hyperlinks. This prevented the user from being able to see detailed IO adapter properties or assign the adapters to IO Pools via the UI.
Fixes a problem where modification to Kerberos and LDAP configuration on the HMC incorrectly updates PAM configuration files. This situation can lead to improper authentication.
Corrected the LPAR activation HSCL05E9 error that occurred when a profile has one or more logical ports from HEA and HEA DRCIndex has a letter in it.
Corrected a problem when setting the promiscuous LPAR for a HEA physical port, then afterward change the speed and duplex values which resulted in an HSCL1585 error.

Platform Management

Corrected a WCL rendering issue where a TreeStyleUI Error is logged causing the UI to refresh and call home SRC E355104C.
Corrected a problem where Managed System connectivity is lost when the DHCP range for the private network is changed on the HMC.

Problem Analysis

Corrected a problem where multiple SRCs were being reported by a frame (BPA) to the HMC. The correct owning CEC MTMS is now associated with the error instead of using the reporting HMC's MTMS.
Eliminated E332FFFF reference code from being generated when pedbg or hmcdebuginfo is run. In these cases, the core and/or dump are requested by the command and are now being collected by that command and not called home.
Eliminated E355049F reference code from being generated due to an error in the HMC Exchange Enclosure function.
Extended the surveillance timeout for LocalSurveillanceAnalysis Domain from 5 to 15 minutes. The B3030001 serviceable event was previously logged when FSPs are restarted and do not come back within 5 minutes.

Repair and Verify

Added Repair & Verify Fill and Drain Tool support for the IBM Power 595 and 575 systems.
Corrected the BPC UEPO procedure navigation buttons for the IBM Power 595 and 575 systems.
Updated the graphics in the IBM Power 570 Node Concurrent Maintenance procedure.
Updated the graphics in the NAM procedure for the IBM Power 595 system.
Corrected support for the isolate procedures associated with cross communication, cross power, IBF, and UPIC cables for IH and HE systems.
Added support for the IBM Power 595 and 570 systems IO drawer isolate and symbolic routines.

System Plan

Corrected a system plan creation problem resulting in a java.lang.NumberFormatException with POWER5 system and at least one VLAN adapter that specifies "IEEE 802.1q compatible adapter" setting.
Corrected a system plan creation problem resulting in an exception with an unknown error when the install of the VIOS OS was done through an HEA.

Enhancements and fixes


POWER6 isolates support was added for a BPA reported failure in Service Focal Point.
Updates were made to steps that must be taken for an HMC to communicate with the managed system if an additional HMC was connected to an IBM Power 570 and 595 system.
Text and graphic updates were made to Concurrent Maintenance Node Add and Repair procedures for IBM Power 570 systems.
Text and location code graphic updates were made to the GX card procedures for the IBM Power 575 and 595 systems.
Graphic modifications were made to various PU Book panels for the IBM Power 575 and 595 systems.
9409-M50 is now supported in HMC R&V interfaces. Also, serviceable events containing IBM Power 550 FRUs can now be serviced.
Text updates were made to include the correct number of tools needed to service the IBM Power 575 and 595 PU Book.
Various text and graphic updates were made in the IBM Power 575 and 595 PU Book procedure.
Updates were made to Problem Analysis error logging information.
Corrected a problem where the CEC state on the HMC doesn't update to show a "No Connection" state after the HMC loses network connection to the CEC.
Enhanced installios to use the netmask when installing the partition.
Corrected a problem where IO Adapters are not displayed in Partition Properties dialog in non-English locales.
Partition Details table on Virtual Network Management Panel was always showing empty.
Bridge adapters were not displayed on Virtual Network Management Panel.
Fixed an issue where the user was unable to delete a virtual switch even though the GUI appeared to not show it associated to any Ethernet adapters in any profiles because the Virtual Adapter - Ethernet GUI panel always displayed the default VSwitch instead of the actual vswitch associated.
When an HEA card is changed, all the LHEA (references) related to that also get changed. Currently while activating or modifying a profile, user gets a warning message saying Hardware has been changed. After the current warning, user should also get a message giving a choice "Remove earlier references" or "keep old references" which was not happening. Now the user has the choice to clean up all references to the HEA logical ports and re-configure the logical ports in the profile.
Fixed a problem where an internal error occurred with error message ACT01503 due to a null pointer exception thrown on the DLPAR Add of the Virtual Ethernet Adapter panel from GUI.
Fixed a problem where deleting a vswitch which is not related to any profile or lpar causes the Virtual Ethernet Adapters associated with other vswitches to be deleted from their lpar profiles. They would re-appear on the next reboot of the HMC..
The system's shared processor pool configuration was not getting cleared when the user selects the "Initialize" task under "Manage Partition Data". With this fix all the pools max capacity and reserve proc units are set to zero.

Notes

For HMCs managing POWER5 servers: If your HMC is at HMC V6 R1.2 or V6 R1.3, upgrading your HMC to HMC V7 R3.3.0 is a two-step process. You must first upgrade the HMC to HMC V7 R3.1.0, and then upgrade to HMC V7 R3.3.0.
The HMC 7.3.3.0 service pack updates are not upgrade packages. That is, they do not upgrade a lower level of HMC V7 to HMC V7 R3.3.0. They are service packs for HMC 7.3.3.0 only. Upgrading from HMC 7.3.2.0 or HMC 7.3.1.0 requires the use of the HMC 7.3.3.0 recovery media.
After you install V7R3.3.0, you must install PTF MH01105. You must perform an additional reboot of the HMC after the mandatory reboot required by installing MH01105

Enhancements and Fixes

This package provides the following enhancements and fixes:
Server and Partition Management

On the Integrated Virtual Ethernet (Host Ethernet Adapter) panels, you can no longer toggle between HEAs. Instead, all physical ports across all HEAs are displayed together. In addition, the profile panels no longer allow LHEA (Logical Host Ethernet Adapter) capabilities to be changed. This is now a command-line only option.
A new user authentication type "ldap" is supported along with existing type "local", and "kerberos". If HMC is configured to use an LDAP server, when a user with ldap authentication type logs in, the authentication will be done via LDAP server.
The max number of lpars that HCA (Host Channel Adapter) adapter(s) can support ranges from 1-16. By default, the max lpars supported is 1 and it can be changed manually using chsyscfg command. The max lpar support setting is applicable for all HCA adapters installed on the system. New HCA 2 adapters can be installed along with HCA 1 adapter(s) on the same system and the max lpar support described above applies to both HCA adapter types.
POWER5 systems now display their SRC codes as clickable links to the full description of the code.
The HMC now supports Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) on the "internet" connections. IPv6 is not supported on network connections to servers.
New user login control mechanism. When adding, modifying, and copying user in the "Manage User Profiles and Access" window, the "User Properties" button will open another window to set the following timeout and remote access properties for the user:
	
Session timeout minutes
Specifies how many minutes a session should last for this user.
		
For GUI login, when the session runs long enough to reach the timeout minutes (no matter if the user actively executes tasks or the session is idle), the GUI will prompt an authentication window to ask the user to re-authenticate. If the re-authentication passed, the next session timeout counting is started. If the authentication failed three times or the authentication password is not re-entered within the Verification Timeout minutes, the session will be forcedly disconnected.
For ssh login, when the session time reaches the limitation, the ssh session will be closed.


Idle timeout minutes
Indicates how long a user session can be idle. When the idle time reaches the set value, the login session will be forcedly disconnected.
Allow remote access via the web
Select/unselecting this item will enable/disable this user from logging on to this HMC via the GUI login remotely.

	Note: A value of zero for Session timeout minutes, Verification timeout minutes, or Idle timeout minutes means no timeout limit.

Platform Management

Creation of a new "View VLAN Network Data" GUI task to display additional detailed data returned from the Collect Network Data command (SPCN).
Add support for the 5767 dual port ethernet adapter for HMC model 7042-CR4. Also added support for an internal modem if there is no additional ethernet card or there is one additional card of type 5767.
Support for the new HMC deskside model 7042-C07.
Ability to initiate a Node Controller Dump from the GUI.
Provide ability to launch the full set of HMC UI tasks from a higher level management console including IBM Director.
Support for the new IBM Power 595 model 9119-FHA and IBM Power 570 model 9117-MMA servers.
A toolbar has been added to the navigation pane which provides back and forward navigation, go to and set a home page, as well as the ability to expand and collapse all navigation nodes.
A new "Tree" view of resources is available in the Systems Management, Servers, and Custom Groups work panes.
Breadcrumbs are now displayed in the work pane to further enhance navigation between views.
The tasks pad is enhanced to include expanding and collapsing of the task groups.
The tasks pad now displays a settings button which allows users to update the number of columns used to display available tasks for selected objects.
Users may now create their own customized column views with the "Manage Views" task in the work pane table toolbar Views menu.
Miscellaneous updates to the Guided Setup Wizard.
Improvements were made to the "Add Enclosure" and "Add FRU" Pending Actions list to enable the Launch Procedure button only when the location code is selected.
Fixed a dialog resizing issue when closing corrective service task.
Fixed a problem to ensure resource locking on DVD-RAM media.
Additional user entry field checking is now done when entering NTP server information.
Support for additional virtual network switches added. A new "Virtual Network Management" task under the Managed System's Configuration tasks allows for the creation and management of virtual network switches.

Command Line

A new command, lsfru, has been added to list selected service processor field-replaceable unit (FRU) information for a managed system (POWER6 servers only).
The following commands have been added to support LDAP configuration on the HMC:
	
chhmcldap
Changes the HMC LDAP configuration
lshmcldap
Lists LDAP user information and HMC LDAP configuration data


The following commands have been enhanced to support HMC LDAP configuration and remote LDAP authentication: chhmcusr, lshmcusr, mkhmcusr, getfile, and rmfile.
The following commands have been enhanced to support virtual switches (POWER6 servers only): chsyscfg, lssyscfg, mksyscfg, chhwres, and lshwres.
The chhmc command has been enhanced to configure the HMC for IPv6 support, and the lshmc command has been enhanced to display the HMC IPv6 configuration settings.
The chhmc and lshmc commands have been enhanced to support changing and displaying the network settings for the sl0 interface.
The lshmc command has been enhanced to display the SSH protocol version(s) the HMC can use.
The chsyscfg and lssyscfg commands have been enhanced to support setting and displaying the address broadcast performance policy for a managed system (POWER6 servers only).
The chsyscfg and lssyscfg commands have been enhanced to support setting and displaying the maximum number of partitions that can use a Host Channel Adapter (HCA) (POWER6 servers only). You must set this value if you want more than one partition to use an HCA.
The chlparutil and lslparutil commands have been enhanced to support new utilization data sampling rates of 30 seconds, 60 seconds, 5 minutes, and 30 minutes.
A new option has been added to the lpar_netboot command to enable or disable firmware spanning tree discovery.
A new option has been added to the lssysconn command to list IP addresses that cannot be automatically discovered by the HMC when using DHCP, and a new option has been added to the rmsysconn command to remove an IP address from that list.
A new option has been added to the lshwinfo command to allow the user to specify the side of the managed frame's bulk power assembly for which to list environmental information. For POWER6 frames with 2 line cords per side, the lshwinfo command will have two output values per attribute; the first value will be for line cord 1, and the second for line cord 2.
The startdump command has been enhanced to support initiation of node service processor dumps (POWER6 servers only).
The -l option on the updlic command now accepts a comma-separated list of firmware levels in the format <stream>_<level>, to allow specific levels to be specified for a mixed POWER5 and POWER6 environment.
Expanded updlic command so that bulk power levels for environments with both POWER5 and POWER6 frames can be specified.

Licensed Internal Code (LIC) update

For POWER6 servers, the HMC will validate the current version of HMC code is compatible with the managed server firmware image:
	
At each connection of the HMC to the FSP
At the beginning of each managed server/power update
And verify that the Power code is also compatible with the managed system firmware.

Help

Enhancements and updates were made to the help documentation.

Repair and Verify

From the R&V panels, inform the user how to find the procedures translated into a language other than English.
Support for I/O Drawer Feature Code 5720. Since this drawer is connected via SAS cables from the I/O adapters in the server, the HMC will not be able to detect its presence in a configuration. The Repair and Verify procedures will be written to instruct the user to manually interact with the drawer. The procedures for each FRU will be displayed within a browser in HTML format.

National Language Support in HMC V7R3.3.0

The NLS support remains the same but there are these known issues:

Mnemonics is no longer supported in the new UI. However, mnemonics are still being shown in certain language environments.
Number format issues with decimal point in certain locales. For example, sometimes period (.) is used instead of comma (,) for decimal point.
To allow all UI displayed in English only in remote management, users can only have English or none in the language list of their browser setting.
Due to the limitation of groff, some characters in the output of "man" command might be corrupted in traditional Chinese, simplified Chinese and Korean when the window is too narrow. Widen the window and retry the command again.
User ID, User information, HMC User password, Partition name, managed system name, profile name and system profile name are in English only.
The gifs displayed are in English in Help for the Main User Interface.
The first page (top-level entries) in each chapter of three Help books ("Base Tasks and Console", "System" and "User Interface") are blank.
The order of the address fields is for US but this address will not be used as mailing address.
The text and flyovers on the Help window will be displayed in English.

Known Issues in HMC V7R3.3.0


The DHCP range choices of 9.6.24.x and 9.6.25.x are no longer available as DHCP server range selections in the HMC GUI for V7. The Power 595/FHA system internal network utilizes this range. If a V6 HMC is upgraded to V7 and a Power 595/FHA system addition is planned, change the range to an alternate available selection before introducing the system to the HMC. For all other system environments the range can still be used but is not visible in the GUI.
Virtual media capabilities that are available with some KVM/Console switches are not supported for use with the HMC and could prevent full functionality of the DVD drive. Please reference the 7316-TF3 sales manual for more information.
Network interfaces may reconfigure to a different interface name (for example: eth0, eth1) after upgrade or install of 7.3.3 from what the interfaces were previously. Verify mapping after installation by issuing "tail -f /var/log/messages" from a restricted shell terminal, then unplug the cable at the interface port to map the "NIC Link is Down" messages to the corresponding ethX value. Note: After a network configuration has been reconfigured to a new interface name, some network configuration options such as private/open may be disabled. If you need to clear or alter an interface but the expected options are disabled please contact IBM support for assistance.
When using the chhmc command to configure Kerberos, the "a" option only accepts IPv4 addresses.
Updating Licensed Internal Code on multiple Managed Systems in a 9125-F2A within the same power frame can be updated simultaneously by using the following procedure:
	
Step 1
Select one Managed System in each frame from the "Servers" or "Updates" panel and perform the Licensed Internal Code update. This will update Licensed Internal Code on the Power Subsystem and the selected Managed System.
Step 2
Select the remaining Managed Systems in all frames from the "Servers" or "Updates" panel. This will update Licensed Internal Code on the remaining Managed Systems. The Power Subsystem was already updated in Step 1 and will not be updated again.

	Note: after Licensed Internal Code has been updated in Step 1, the image is saved on the HMC. The "disk" repository can then be used for subsequent updates in Step 2.
After login through ssh an error may be output to the screen "bash: /dev/pts/3: restricted: cannot redirect output". The error is harmless and can be ignored. This error will ONLY happen if the DISPLAY environment is set, that is, when the user performs ssh onto the HMC with the -X or -Y (for X11 Forwarding) option.
System Plans will not deploy if using an HEA adapter for the Ethernet connection to do the network install of the partition. This will be fixed in the first Service Pack.

Fixes
The following fixes are addressed in this PTF:
This package updates your HMC from HMC V7R3.1.0 to HMC V7R3.2.0. You can also reference this package by APAR MB02134. All enhancements and fixes included in this package is the same as for PTF MH01059.

Server and Partition Management

I/O Reporting Partition (Hardware Discovery). Available only for POWER6 hardware.
	
Provides summary of I/O attached to the system pre-OS for configuration.
Provides HMC users more detailed view of slot contents including child devices.
Allows administrators to view Ethernet MAC addresses and FibreChannel WWNs from the HMC before partitions are configured.
Provides detailed inventory to System Plan Tool to verify system configuration and validate customer orders


Ability to create multiple virtual processor pools, providing easier license management by capping the number of processor cycles that can be consumed by a group of uncapped logical partitions.
Partition mobility - a new HMC function, on systems that are capable to use this function, that enables moving a partition from one managed system to another. The active partition mobility function provides the HMC administrator the ability to non-disruptively move a running partition, with its operating system and applications, profiles, and virtualized resources, across two capable and compatible servers that are under the control of the same HMC. The inactive partition mobility function provides the ability to move an inactive, powered-off partition, with its profiles and virtualized resources, across two servers that are under the control of the same HMC.
Support for redundant POWER6 FSP failover.

Platform Management

Added support to allow the use of Kerberos to authenticate users on HMC. Users are created on the local HMC, but uses a remote Kerberos server for authentication.
Added support to set up Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) server configuration.
Corrected Manage Dumps task handling of dump parameters for a POWER5 server.
Redundant FSP enhancements and corrections.
Added a Deactivate Attention LED task that allows a user to deactivate the attention LED's on multiple servers and/or partitions. This new task simplifies the previous methods for deactivating LED's, View System Attention tasks for systems and Manage Attention LED for partitions, which were single target tasks.
Corrected a problem where an FSP dump could not be initiated from HMC when system is in poweron state giving unrecoverable error message.
Added console log events for adding and deleting NTP servers to create audit trail.
Corrected a problem in the HMC backup critical console data task where it does not detect specific permission problem on a remote directory on the ftp server. This problem prevented backup from completing although a message was displayed that indicated the task completed successfully.
Corrected errors that caused mail to be sent to the HMC console resulting in performance degradation on the HMC.
Corrected an issue with backup of the HMC where their HMC archive data may be directed to an unknown location. If the user did NOT specify an optional directory to offload their HMC archive to, there will be an internal 'cd /' issued from within the ftp session. Where that directs their data depends on how their ftp server is set up. It may be re-directed to user's home directory or to their ftp server's physical "/" directory.
Corrected an issue with the HMC interface with multiple column tables where a sort option was not performing correctly.
Corrected user interface code to handle the change in formatting of the V7 HMC model type and display the information correctly.
Corrected a problem in Systems Management where a user could not toggle between Capacity on Demand and default views using MS Internet Explorer V6.0.
Corrected a problem where the HMC User Interface Task Bar was flashing continuously.
Updated the Network Settings task's reboot/restart requirements. A reboot is no longer required for most modifications to network settings.
Enhanced Partition Availability Priority user interface.
Miscellaneous improvements to the Guided Setup Install Wizard.
Corrected the deployment of the main HMC user interface window to adjust the screen height on the local console.
Corrected a problem when using a context menu or drop-down menu in the HMC Work Pane, the opened menu will freeze.
Corrected an error found when using the provided icon or drop down options to filter a table to reduce the number of visible rows. Instead of only rows that are NOT filtered out being selected, all rows of the table are selected.
Corrected problems seen on an HMC console with more than one console active (local and remote), where tasks were not visible and panels were not fully rendered.
Corrected a problem with Network Settings when attempting to return the network interface from an open, non-DHCP Server configuration (on the private subnet shared with the FSPs and DHCP Server) to a previous private, DHCP Server configuration.
Corrected a problem in Manage Task and Resource Roles with copying the customized resource roles.
Clarified and handled the field 'No IPv4 address' on the Change Network Settings/Adapter Details panel.
Enhanced HMC User Roles so that users assigned Super User roles (hmcsuperadmin) will be able to customize their individual user settings independently of other HMC Super Users. Previously all user assigned Super User roles shared user settings.
Added help to Customizable Data Replication for "Customer Information" data.
Enhanced Change User Password task user interface.

Power Management

With power saver mode capable system, customers can enable this feature through HMC to save power by dropping the voltage and frequency to a fixed percentage.
Customers can now schedule the power saver mode feature through the schedule operations task by selecting a managed system.
IBM Systems Director Active Energy Manager can collect trending information and perform other advanced EnergyScale features by utilizing HMC's network connections to managed systems.
For more information on EnergyScale feature, refer to the white paper for IBM EnergyScale for POWER6 Processor-Based Systems.

Service Management

Enhanced the HMC Serviceable Event feature to not only provide Serviceable Events for the managed system, but to now also include Serviceable Events for the HMC.
SNMP traps were extended to generate HMC related notices.
New HMC monitored resources including:


CCFW JVM activity.
Total HMC system usage.
Individual process usage.
Disk partition utilization.


A new command, chhmcfs, was created to manage log files.
Enhanced ServiceRM to handle increased number of partitions in a single PHYP based system.
The design ServiceRM was enhanced to control the flow of data between itself, the RMC daemon and the client on the HMC to better handle memory and alleviate contention for resources.
ServiceRM was also modified from handling RMC requests one at a time to handling multiple requests. Previously, if one request did not complete the subsequent requests would be queued and resulting in possible deadlock. Now requests are honored with multiple threads.

Command Line

The following commands have been added to manage HMC file system disk space usage:
	
chhmcfs - frees up space in HMC file systems
lshmcfs - lists HMC file system disk space usage information


A new command, rnvi, has been added to enable HMC users to edit text files in a restricted mode.
The following commands have been added to configure and list power management settings for a managed system (POWER6 servers only):
	
chpwrmgmt - changes power management settings
lspwrmgmt - lists power management settings


The following commands have been added to support partition mobility (POWER6 servers only):
	
lslparmigr - lists partition migration information
migrlpar - performs a partition migration operation


The following commands have been enhanced to support partition mobility (POWER6 servers only): chsyscfg, lssyscfg, and mksyscfg.
The following commands have been added to support Kerberos configuration on the HMC:
	
getfile - gets and deploys the Kerberos service key (keytab) file on the HMC
rmfile - removes the Kerberos service key (keytab) file from the HMC


The following commands have been enhanced to support Kerberos configuration on the HMC and remote Kerberos authentication: chhmc, lshmc, chhmcusr, lshmcusr, and mkhmcusr.
The following commands have been enhanced to support multiple shared processor pools (POWER6 servers only): chsyscfg, lssyscfg, mksyscfg, chhwres, lshwres, and lslparutil.
The following commands have been enhanced to support hardware discovery (POWER6 servers only): chsysstate and lshwres.
A new option has been added to the chhmc command to set the SSH protocol version for the HMC to use.
The chhmc and lshmc commands have been enhanced to support enabling and disabling remote web browser access to the HMC.
A new -s option has been added to the getupgfiles command to allow secure FTP to be used to transfer the upgrade files.
The lssyscfg -r sys command has been changed. The sp_failover_enabled and sp_failover_state attributes are no longer output unless the -F option is specified on the command. Now those attribute values will only be displayed if either the -F option is specified with no attribute names, or if the sp_failover_enabled and sp_failover_state attribute names are specified with the -F option.
The -o noprobe option for the mksysplan command has been deprecated. It has been replaced by the --noprobe option. In addition, two new options for inventory collection have been added to the mksysplan command: --nohwdisc and --noinvscout.
A new option has been added to the sendfile command to allow the user to specify the name of the file on the remote system.
A new option has been added to the updlic command to synchronize Licensed Internal Code on redundant service processors, and also on redundant Bulk Power Controllers.
Hardware Discovery command line enhancements:
	
chsysstate -r sys will include the new option onhwdisc
lssyscfg -r sys will display the new cec capability for Hardware Discovery, hardware_discovery_capable
lssyscfg -r lpar will display the new lpar definition state for Hardware Discovery in the lpar_env and lpar_type attribute.
lssyscfg -r lpar will display the new VSP definition state for Hardware Discovery in the state attribute.
lssyscfg -r prof will display the new lpar definition state for Hardware Discovery in the lpar_env attribute.
lshwres -r io -rsubtype will include a new type slotchildren to list Hardware Discovery slot information




Licensed Internal Code (LIC) update

Enhanced Code Update logic to disallow accept/reject if all components are running on the "wrong" flash side:
	
If all components are on the T side, the reject option is grayed out in the GUI, and the "updlic -o j" command will give the following error message:

		
The reject operation cannot be performed because all components are running on the temporary flash side.


Likewise, if all components are on the P side, the accept option is grayed out in the GUI, and the "updlic -o c" command will give the following error message:
		
The accept operation cannot be performed because all components are running on the permanent flash side.


If there is a mixture of components on the T and P sides, the accept/reject operations can be performed to the subset of components that are on the correct side for the operation (for example: those running on T side for accept and those running on P side for reject). In this situation, a message will be displayed to the user asking if they want to continue.


Enhanced estimated time values.
Amended Code Update to make E302F8A5 an informational log instead of an error log when exceptions are received from lslic command in an effort to determine HMC code update ownership.
Corrected a code update issue where if multiple updates were started at approximately the same time but to different repositories the data from one repository survey could be overwritten by the second.
Corrected code update to support updating of systems that have only one BPC.

Scheduled Operations

Added support to Scheduled Operations for Utility Capacity on Demand (CoD). There are two different scheduled operations for Utility CoD:
	
Moving Utility CoD processors in/out of the shared processor pool. This will be accomplished via the chcod command.
Setting the maximum Utility CoD minute usage limit. The idea is that the customer could schedule the setting of this limit on a monthly basis, therefore implementing a monthly Utility CoD minute usage limit. This will be accomplished via the chcod command.


Corrected Scheduled Operations Backup Profile Data to include a --force parameter to always overwrite any pre-existing backup file.
Corrected a problem seen in Dynamic configuration Scheduled Operation View Details. This was an issue that only affects Dynamic Reconfiguration Scheduled Operation that were migrated from the 6.1.2 HMC.

Problem Analysis

Corrected handling of contention for dumps from 2 HMC's to prevent the incorrect HMC from retrieving the dump and multiple call homes for the same error. A serviceable event will be created on one of the HMC's indicating a dump could not be retrieved.
Enhanced Dump Manager to track call home status and problem association.
Enhanced SFP Serviceable Event Overview sorting.
Modify serviceable event text for PEL-based events to not include PEL severity information.
Enhanced call home data to include a reference code summary file to provide a more concise, complete, and readable version of the serviceable event data that includes all serviceable events on the HMC.
Amended refcode lookup code to handle the refcode format passed in via the partition view's refcode column that includes the partition as part of the input. (for example:  B2004158 LP=002)
Added a busy/processing window to eServer Registration process interface so that it is apparent that background processing is going on.

Service Agent

Change to handle 9 character refcodes.
Corrected a problem with remote session when running with Firefox browser handling password updates and resets.

Repair and Verify

Added support to concurrently add a new GX adapter as an upgrade and for the concurrent (cold) repair support for GX Adapters. The adapter must be deconfigured/garded during IPL/reIPL prior to the repair.
Added support for I/O Drawers MTM 7041-SD1, Feature Code 5886, and MTM 7214-1U2. Since these drawers are connected via SAS cables from the I/O adapters in the server, the HMC will not be able to detect their presence in a configuration. The Repair and Verify procedures will be written to instruct the user to manually interact with the drawer. The procedures for each FRU will be displayed within a browser in HTML format.
Corrected the 5094 exchange procedure graphics to include the locations of the connectors on the card in location C10.
Corrected repair procedure for PCI adapter cards on System I.
Enhanced and/or corrected instructions for Service Processor cable removal
Enhanced concurrent repair instructions for removable media devices to include quiescent of applications running on operating systems that may be using a removable media device and using operation procedures to manually shut down of all applications and logical partitions
Enhanced process for exchange of VPD passthru card
Corrected panel flow for the exchange of the power cables for the 5094
Corrected/enhanced concurrent and nonconcurrent procedures for the exchange of MMA fans.
Add support to procedures and service guides to handle the I/O expansion units G30, 5790, 5796 and 5296.
Clarified the A2 Fan Exchange procedure to instruct the user to replace the Op Panel only if it was removed.
Corrected the way that surveillance errors are logged by the HMC for valid managed systems without an MTMS. Previously, by default RV launched information center content. Now the correct isolate procedures will be run.
Corrected the procedure for an MMA fan to be concurrent.

Known issues in HMC V7R3.2.0

Concurrent FRU replacement of Feature Code 1802 GX Dual Port 12X Channel Attached Adapter fails with a Null exception when the operation is performed from an HMC at levels V7R3.2.0 base or V7R3.2.0 with Service Pack 1 installed. The failure will occur during the reconfiguration steps which follow the physical adapter replacement. Recovery of the adapter and it's attached resources will require a platform IPL. This issue is resolved with the installation of PTF MH01100.
A timing issue exists where 2 panels, using the same set of information, and one panel modifies some data and the other panel knows nothing about the modifications. This situation can result in "stale" data overwriting newer data. The problem will be fixed in a later PTF.
If an HMC is attached to an initialized system without micropartitioning turned on, LPAR profile creation will fail. The workaround is to rebuild the managed system. The problem will be fixed in a later PTF.
A DLPAR "Move Memory" operation will partially fail if the move hits pinned memory. Sometimes the pinned memory is higher than the reported minimum. The amount of memory moved will be some fraction of the amount of memory requested in the move. The error message gives the impression that the whole operation failed. The problem will be fixed in a later PTF.
If a Virtual Ethernet Adapter is added with a VLAN ID of 1, the adapter will show up as missing in the LPAR Properties panel for an AIX partition. The problem will be fixed in a later PTF.
When a customized user logs in, the "tip of the day" panel displays a task error. The problem will be fixed in a later PTF.
After performing a dynamic logical partition action on a virtual serial adapter, the virtual adapter properties window may only show the lpar ID and value "65536" for the name field. The Manage Profile and dynamic logical partition windows show the name properly. A reboot of the HMC will resolve the inconsistency and populate the name field. The problem will be fixed in a later PTF.
After upgrade to V7R3.2.0 if a backup critical console data at that version is later restored during a recovery of the HMC, then the first initial login attempt is not accepted and a second login is required. The problem will be fixed in a later PTF.

Corrected and enhanced the Repair and Verify procedure for the replacement of the shuttle assembly on a 7314-G30 drawer.
Corrected the Repair and Verify procedure for the replacement of the VPD card on an 570 system.
Corrected an omission in the Repair and Verify procedure for performing a repair operation on any 7314-G30 I/O tower that requires the tower to be powered off. Instructions were not given to vary on devices that were previously varied off. This includes SPCN card, Backplane, InfiniBand card, or non redundant power supply repair.
Corrected an error in the instructions for the concurrent repair of a 570/560 power supply where the incorrect location is given for the redundant power supply.
Corrected a problem in a multiple HMC environment where the user was instructed to initiate the Launch Remote Hardware Management Console from the HMC Management screen of the secondary HMC. That option cannot be initiated remotely. The user is now instructed to go to the local console to initiate the task.
Corrected a problem when performing a repair operation on a 7311-D10 I/O backplane. Repair Verify does not instruct the CE to record and restore the configuration information associated with the I/O tower that is contained in ASM. This could leave the tower unusable.
Correct some Repair and Verify procedures that were not launching HTML panels or panels were missing graphics.
Fix to allow vary off for Repair and Verify exchange FRU and remove FRU.

The other option is to connect to the HMC using a remote emulator, for example: IBM Personal Communications or iSeries Access, in the desired locale.
To configure virtual terminal session to display translated text, select the appropriate encoding from virtual terminal encoding menu.

Known issues:

Mnemonics is no longer supported in the new UI. However, mnemonics are still being shown in certain language environments.
Number format issues with decimal point in certain locales. For example, sometimes period (.) is used instead of comma (,) for decimal point.
To allow all UI displayed in English only in remote management, users can only have English or none in the language list of their browser setting.
Due to the limitation of groff, some characters in the output of "man" command might be corrupted in traditional Chinese, simplified Chinese and Korean when the window is too narrow. Widen the window and retry the command again.
User ID, User information, HMC User password, Partition name, managed system name, profile name and system profile name are in English only.
IBM275 doesn't work well when connecting from IBM Personal Communications or iSeries Access to an HMC. Use another Brazil codepage. The codepage "IBM930 Japan Katakana" doesn't work well either. Use "IBM930 Japan Katakana Extended" instead.

Version: 7
Release: 3.1.0
Service Pack: 0
HMC Build level 20070518.1
","base_version=V7R3.1.0

Enhancements and fixes for HMC V7 3.1.0
This package provides the following enhancements and fixes:
Server and Partition Management
The most significant and the most noticeable change in the HMC for V7 R3.1.0 is the move to a new Web-based User Interface both locally and remote. This interface uses a tree style navigation model providing hierarchical views of system resources and tasks using drill-down and launch-in-context techniques to enable direct access to hardware resources and task management capabilities. It provides views of system resources and provides tasks for system administration.
HMC V7 R3.1.0 can manage both POWER5 (with SF240_299 firmware level and above) and POWER6 servers.
On Power6 servers the following new features/enhancements have been added.

Support for Host Ethernet Adapter (HEA). An HEA provides each logical partition using the adapter with its own virtual adapter and logical ports. An HEA may be shared between multiple partitions. This provides direct data and control path between the partitions and the adapter, allowing partition-to-partition connectivity.
Partition Availability Priority. This can be used to prevent transient and catastrophic CPU (processor core) failures from resulting in system or partition termination. Total recovery from catastrophic CPU failures will require that a spare processor is or can be made available to replace the failed CPU.
Utility CoD is a new CoD offering for HMC V7 R3.1.0. It replaces the Reserve CoD offering. Utility CoD is only available for processor resources.
Enhancements to the Dump facilities. These enhancements will reduce unplanned customer outages and improve platform serviceability, by eliminating unneeded and duplicate hardware data from platform system dump, and moving all formatting of dump data to the post-collection analysis phase. This improves dump runtime performance and frees up FSP control store to allow more problem-specific hardware data to be collected.
Shared Pool Usage of Dedicated Capacity. This feature provides the ability for partitions that normally run as "dedicated processor" partitions to contribute unused processor capacity to the shared processor pool. Customers may use some of the capacity that is formerly locked up in dedicated processor partitions to satisfy peak needs for the shared processor pool without resorting to using utility on-demand processors.
Virtual Server Model Instrumentation. This feature provides a common interface for server system management. Driven by IBM and several other companies, there is an effort to standardize the Virtual Server Model (VS Model) for the server system management, which includes the managed server resource representation and the management service functions. HMC V7 R3.1.0 contains the first phase of work for HMC to provide the standardized VS Model as the common interface for third parties to manage the server system and their hardware resources.

System Plan

Automated installation of VIOS into LPAR
Automated provisioning of virtual resources with the VIOS LPAR
Improved capability of creating a system plan from a managed system
Additional import &export capability via HTTPS
Improved System Plan Viewer user controls and details

HMC command line

A new command, dump, has been added. The dump command sets the system dump parameters for a managed system (POWER6 servers only).
The following commands have been added for system plan resource management on the HMC:
	
defsysplanres
defines a system plan resource
lssysplanres
lists defined system plan resources
rmsysplanres
removes a defined system plan resource


The following commands have been enhanced to support barrier synchronization (POWER6 servers only): chsyscfg, lshwres, lssyscfg, and mksyscfg.
The following commands have been enhanced to support partition availability priorities (POWER6 servers only): chsyscfg, lssyscfg, and mksyscfg.
The following commands have been enhanced to support the new processor sharing mode that allows an active dedicated processor partition to share its unused processors (POWER6 servers only): chhwres, chsyscfg, lshwres, lslparutil, lssyscfg, and mksyscfg.
The following commands have been enhanced to support electronic error reporting for i5/OS partitions (POWER6 servers only): chsyscfg, lssyscfg, and mksyscfg.
The following commands have been enhanced to support processor compatibility modes (POWER6 servers only): chsyscfg, lssyscfg, and mksyscfg.
The following commands have been enhanced to support Host Ethernet Adapters (POWER6 servers only): chhwres, chsyscfg, lshwres, lssyscfg, mksyscfg, and rsthwres.
The following commands have been enhanced to support Utility Capacity on Demand (POWER6 servers only): chcod, lscod, and lslparutil.
The lssyscfg -r prof command to list partition profiles has been changed. The --filter option to specify the partition for which profiles are to be listed is no longer required. Therefore, all partition profiles for all partitions in the managed system can now be listed by issuing lssyscfg -r prof -m <managed system>.
The mksyscfg -r lpar and mksyscfg -r prof commands have been changed. The load_source_slot attribute is no longer required to be specified when creating an i5/OS partition or partition profile on a POWER6 server.
The partition shared_proc_pool_util_auth attribute has been deprecated. It has been replaced by the allow_perf_collection attribute. These two attributes will always have the same value. The commands that use these attributes are chsyscfg, lssyscfg, and mksyscfg.
A new option has been added to the chsysstate command to enable console service functions for an i5/OS partition.
New options have been added to the chhmc command to set the date, time, time zone and clock type on the HMC.
A new option has been added to the chsvcevent command to close all serviceable events on the HMC.
A new option has been added to the mksysplan command to limit the inventory gathered to just the PCI slot devices.
A new option has been added to the mksysplan command to display verbose output during command processing.
A new option has been added to the lsdump command to list the system dump parameters for a managed system (POWER6 servers only).
The lsdump -h command has been enhanced to display dump offload progress.
The lslic -t power and lslic -t syspower commands have been enhanced to display automatic code download status.
A new option has been added to the lslic command to display Power FRU level and status information.
The dlslic command has been removed. The information that was displayed by the dlslic command is now displayed by the lslic command.
Due to security restrictions in the HMC Web-based user interface, an HTML file containing Terms and Conditions can no longer be presented to users who login locally on the HMC. Instead, a text file containing welcome text can be presented to users who login locally on the HMC. Therefore, the chusrtca command has been changed to no longer support deployment of Terms and Conditions and to support deployment of welcome text instead. If you are upgrading from HMC V6 R1 and the display or Terms and Conditions at login is currently enabled on your HMC, then the contents of the UserLicense.html file containing the Terms and Conditions is preserved. After the upgrade is complete, the contents of the UserLicense.html file will exist unchanged in the /opt/hsc/data/license/WelcomeFile.txt file and will be displayed as welcome text to users that login locally on the HMC. You may then want to deploy a new welcome text file that does not contain HTML and that has text that better fits a welcome message.
The lsusrtca command has been deprecated.
To use X11Forwarding on HMC, from the SSH client, run your ssh command with the -Y or set the value of ForwardX11Trusted in your /etc/ssh_config file to yes
The max_capacity_sys_proc_units and max_capacity_sys_mem attributes displayed by the lshwres command have been deprecated since these values cannot be accurately determined for all managed systems. For partition profiles, the maximum memory value will now be limited to the value 4,294,967,295 (0xFFFFFFFF) MB. The maximum processor values for a partition profile will now be limited to a new value, which is displayed by the new attribute max_procs_per_lpar in the lshwres command.
The lsmediadev command has been enhanced to display the mount point for each removable media device.

Licensed Internal Code (LIC) update

A new task was added which allows the user to ensure that the system has no errors which will prevent Licensed Internal Code update from working correctly. This new task is invoked by selecting "Check System Readiness" from the Updates task selection list or using the -o k parameter of the updlic command.
A new task was added which allows the user to view system information without entering a "change" task. This new task is invoked by selecting "View System Information" from the Updates task selection list.
The restricted-access dlslic command was removed. Equivalent capability was added to the lslic command. For more details, see the command line section of the readme.

Save Upgrade Data/Backup
Added support for saving data to USB memory stick.
Network connectivity
Allow VPN selectable interface and route for ipsec communication
Previously, VPN did not work if the interface for ipsec traffic was different from the public default gateway interface. For instance, if eth1 had been set up for the VPN connection, and eth2 was the "public" network and had the default route, then even after adding static routes for the VPN catchers for eth1, the ipsec program used the default route for communication. This behavior has been changed so that the defined routes will be used to establish the VPN.
RIO Topology
The GUI path to view the RIO Topology is:
Hardware (Information) -> Adapters -> View RIO Topology
Under this path, "View RIO Topology" has been changed to "View Hardware Topology"
Service Focal Point (SFP)
Added refcode links to Manage Serviceable Events.
DLPAR


Memory and Processors
You will notice that the DLPAR operations have slightly changed in the V7 R3.1.0 HMC. An overall change is that the Add and Remove operations for memory and processor resources have been combined into one task. For example, when you want to change the amount of memory that is assigned to the partition you simply launch the "Add/Remove" memory task and enter in the amount of memory you would like to have assigned to the lpar.
Physical I/O
For Physical I/O resources we have combined the move and remove operation into one task so that now you can optionally move the I/O resource that you are trying to remove to another partition. The "Add" operation for I/O resources has basically stayed the same.
RMC-less DLPAR for AIX/Linux Partitions
POWER5 HMC supported DLPAR operations between two AIX or Linux partitions that do not have RMC connections. This function has been removed from the UI due to the fact that these types of operations require multiple steps for the user in order to be successful. You can still remove or add resources to a partition that doesn't have an RMC connection, however you will not be able to move resources between two AIX or Linux partitions that do not have active RMC connections.
Another change that has been implemented for DLPAR operations is that the task will display an indicator within the dialog for AIX and Linux partitions the alerts you to the fact that an RMC connection is missing. This is so that you know you are about to perform and RMC-less DLPAR operation before you start entering data into the fields in the dialog.
If you would still like to move resources between two AIX or Linux partitions that do not have RMC connections the command line "chhwres" command can still be used to facilitate the move operation.

Known issues in HMC V7 R3.1.0

Web browser requirements
Hardware Management Console web browser support requires HTML 2.0, JavaScript 1.0, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and cookie support in browsers that will connect to it. Contact your support personnel to assist you in determining if your browser is configured with a Java Virtual Machine. It is required that the web browser uses the HTTP 1.1 protocol and if you are using a proxy server, the HTTP 1.1 protocol is enabled for the proxy connections. Additionally, pop-ups must be enabled for all Hardware Management Consoles addressed in the browser if running with pop-ups disabled. The following browsers have been tested:

Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 or later
If this browser is configured to use an Internet proxy, then local intranet addresses should be included in the exception list, consult your network administrator for more information. If you still need to use the proxy to get to the Hardware Management Console, enable Use HTTP 1.1 through proxy connections under the Advanced tab in your Internet Options window.
Firefox 1.5.0.6 or later.
For Firefox 2.0 make sure the JavaScript options to raise or lower windows and move or resize existing windows are enabled. To enable these options, go to the Content tab in the browser's Options dialog. Click the Advanced button adjacent to the Enable JavaScript checkbox, and then select Raise or lower windows option and Move or resize existing windows option. These features allow you to switch easily between HMC tasks.



Other Web Browser Considerations
Session cookies need to be enabled in order for ASMI to work when connected to HMC remotely. The asm proxy code saves session information and uses it.
Using Internet Explorer

Select Tools -> Internet Options.
Select Privacy tab and select 'Advanced'.
Check if 'Always allow session cookies'.
If not checked, check 'Override automatic cookie handling' and check 'Always allow session cookies'.
You can choose how you want to handle First-party Cookies and Third-party Cookies, block or prompt or accept. (Prompt is preferred in which case you will be prompted every time a site tries to write cookies. It may be a little annoying, but it is the safe thing to do. Some sites need to be allowed to write cookies)

Using Firefox

Tools -> Options
Select Cookies Tab
Select check box Allow sites to set cookies.
If you want to allow only specific sites then select 'Exceptions' and then you can just add this HMC to allow.

Other Issues

The HMC now reserves the first ten virtual adapter slots on each VIOS (Virtual I/O Server) partition for internal HMC use.
Configuration rules:


The maximum Virtual I/O Slot Number should be set to (at least) 10 plus the number of virtual I/O slots desired by the customer.
	Note that setting the maximum higher is OK, the danger is setting it too low. Setting it below 10 will cause a compatibility issue with newer levels of HMC code. Excess virtual slots use a small amount of additional memory, but otherwise have no impact.
All customer virtual I/O slots (virtual SCSI, virtual Ethernet or virtual serial) must use virtual slot IDs 11 or greater.


When using the updhmc command with the -i flag, input echo is not restored when the command finishes. You can use the CTRL-D key to logoff then log back in.
The System Plan tasks "Create System Plan" and "Import System Plan" are only available from the Task pad pane. If the task pad pane has been disabled, it can be re-enabled by clicking HMC Management in the navigation area, then clicking "Change User Interface Settings" in the Work Pane. Check the "Tasks pad" box and click apply.
Existing system plans on a Version 6.1.2 HMC are not migrated on an upgrade.
An ASM session brought up from the HMC can still be available even after the user logs off the HMC. The ASM window can be left open for unauthorized access. The proper method for a graceful exit from the ASM session is to select the "Log off" button in the ASMI window, then close the ASMI window. This can happen in both local and remote mode.





Hints and tips for the HMC user interface

Several major components comprise this user interface:

Banner
Across the top of the workplace window, the Banner identifies the product and logo. It is optionally displayed and is set by using the Change User Interface Settings task.
Task bar
Located below the Banner, the Task bar displays the name(s) of any tasks that are running, the user ID under which you are logged in and online help information. It also provides the ability to log off or disconnect from the console.
Navigation pane
Located in the left portion of the window, the Navigation pane contains the primary navigation links for managing your system resources and the Hardware Management Console. The items are referred to as nodes.
Work pane
Located in the right portion of the window, the Work pane displays information based on the current selection from the Navigation pane. For example, when Welcome is selected in the Navigation pane, the Welcome window content is displayed in the Work pane.
Status bar
Located in the bottom left portion of the window, the Status bar provides visual indicators of current overall system status. It also contains a status overview icon which may be selected to display more detailed status information in the Work pane.




The System p Operations Guide for the Hardware Management Console and Managed Systems can be accessed online on the HMC. Select Welcome in the Navigation pane. The Welcome window content is displayed in the Work pane. Select HMC Operations Guide to view it.
Additional education, support, tutorial and technical information can also be accessed online on the HMC. Select Welcome in the Navigation pane. The Welcome window content is displayed in the Work pane. Select Online Information to view it.
To log on to the HMC from a remote browser, the HMC must first be configured for web browser access. See Appendix B of the System p Operations Guide for the Hardware Management Console and Managed Systems for instructions on how to configure the HMC for remote web browser access. After the HMC has been properly configured, from your web browser enter the URL of the HMC using the format https://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx. Also in Appendix B, it is important to read the "Logging on the HMC from a LAN connected Web browser" section. Security warnings may be presented to your Web browser and the issues related to certificate management should be understood prior to using this function so you can perform the appropriate actions.



Other hints and tips

Upgrade hints
Certificates and key ring files generated by the System Manager Security application (on HMC Version 6) will not be migrated to HMC Version 7. Applications such as remote 5250, which import the public key ring file to establish a secure connection with HMC, will need to import a new public key ring file. The new file, SM.pubkr, will be generated and stored on HMC V7 under the /opt/ccfw/data directory. You can copy this file by using the scp or sendfile command.
For further information on how to set up remote 5250 by using SSL, see the support document located on the System i Technical Support website. This document and many others can be found by selecting the "Technical databases" link.
The IBM System p Information Delivery Design
With the introduction of IBM System p with POWER6 technology, IBM is changing many aspects of its product information delivery. IBM has produced a full-color document that identifies these changes and explains the improvements to user experience. This document is called Introducing Improved Information Delivery for IBM System p Hardware, and includes these topics:

Highlights of the IBM System p information delivery design.
The IBM System p product information that is available, who it is intended for, and where it is located.
IBM System p product information that is available from the Hardware Management Console.
The organization and delivery of IBM System p product information and education through the IBM Systems Support Site.
Access and navigation of IBM System p publications.
Who does what to service IBM system p hardware.

Introducing Improved Information Delivery for IBM System p Hardware is available from this Support for IBM System p website.

From this page, make sure that System p is the hardware entry selected, and then click Go.
Select System p hardware publications under Hardware/Documentation.
Select Introducing Improved Information Delivery for IBM System p Hardware from the publication titles listed.

With HMC V7 External websites, including the "IBM Systems Hardware Information Center" and "IBM Systems Support Site", can no longer be accessed directly from the HMC and will require a remote HMC session or separate system with Internet access.
Repair and verify information is launched automatically on the HMC during the repair of a serviceable event. Repair and verify information, online help, reference codes, the "Operations Guide for the Hardware Management Console," and the "IBM Systems Hardware Information Center" are all included as part of the HMC licensed internal code. The "IBM Systems Hardware Information Center," which provides POWER5 technical data, is included in the licensed internal code for situations where HMC V7 (with SF240_299 firmware level and above) is managing POWER5 systems, with access only to the information required to address the serviceable event.
V6 R1.X to V7 R3.1.0 Task Mappings
This information is used to aid POWER5 HMC users in locating the equivalent WebSM HMC task in the new Web-based HMC UI. The information is divided into the following sections:

Server and Partition Management
Manage On Demand Activations
Frame Management
Utilization Data Management
System Plans
Licensed Internal Code Maintenance
HMC Management
Service Applications

Refer to the System p Operations Guide for the Hardware Management Console and Managed Systems for a complete list of the Task Mappings.
