Apache HTTP Server: SSRF with mod_rewrite in server/vhost context on Windows (CVE-2024-40898)\n\t* Fixed in: 2.4.62\n\t* Affects: 2.4.0 through 2.4.61\nHere are the extracted information:\n\n**Solutions/Mitigations/Tech Insights:**\n\n* Upgrade to version 2.4.61 to fix the issue of source code disclosure of local content.\n* Configure new directive \"UNCList\" to allow access during request processing in Apache HTTP Server on Windows.\n* Upgrade to version 2.4.60, which fixes issues with:\n\t+ WebSocket protocol upgrades over a HTTP/2 connection.\n\t+ SSRF in Apache HTTP Server on Windows that allows potentially leak NTLM hashes to a malicious server via SSRF and malicious requests or content.\n\t+ Encoding problem in mod_proxy that allows request URLs with incorrect encoding to be sent to backend services, potentially bypassing authentication.\n\t+ Substitution encoding issue in mod_rewrite that allows attacker to execute scripts in directories permitted by the configuration but not directly reachable by any URL.\nHere are the extracted pieces of information:\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n* Rewrite flag \"UnsafeAllow3F\" can be used to opt back in once ensuring the substitution is appropriately constrained.\n* Upgrade to version 2.4.60 to fix issues.\n\n**Mitigations:**\n\n* Use rewrite flag \"UnsafePrefixStat\" to opt back in for some unsafe RewriteRules.\n* Port legacy uses of 'AddType' directive to 'SetHandler' after this fix.\n* Upgrade to version 2.4.60, which fixes all identified issues.\n\n**Technical Insights:**\n\n* Some unsafe RewiteRules will be broken by this change and the rewrite flag \"UnsafePrefixStat\" can be used to opt back in once ensuring the substitution is appropriately constrained.\n* Improper escaping of output in mod_rewrite allows an attacker to map URLs to filesystem locations that are permitted to be served by the server but are not intentionally/directly reachable by any URL, resulting in code
