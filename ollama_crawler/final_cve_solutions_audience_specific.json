tries to create rather than modify users created by a utility: moves ssh_authorized_key resource's creation to the end of the user type flow: PUP-11320 * Reduces memory usage when parsing manifests: PUP-11318, PUP-11236 * Reduces excessive Pathname allocations when parsing Puppet manifests: PUP-11312 * Reduces memory consumption from lib/puppet/pops/parser/lexer2.rb: PUP-11236 * Strips redundant numbers in versioncmp: PUP-11235 Here are the extracted pieces of information: **Solutions:** * Puppet resolves the facts being used for classification before the node request to fix a bug where facts provided in a file were not being merged with the facts used for classification  * Gathering trusted facts from the PuppetDB query result and overriding the trusted facts context fixes an issue where trusted facts could not be used as rules for classification  **Mitigations:** * Ensure that when using puppet lookup with --facts, if the facts file overrides any of hostname, domain, fqdn, clientcert, it must override all of them  * Implement checks for node facts/facts given in a fact file and raise an error if it doesn't find any to avoid misleading results when using the --node flag  **Technical Insights:** * Puppet can now manage files whose names start with tilde \"~\" characters  Here are the extracted information: * Puppet can leak credentials when following HTTP redirects:
